Thank you so much for the kind words  I'm a college student so it is admittedly hard to find people like that  All my friends back home in Jersey are varying degrees of heavy drinkers and so are the ones at school  Everyone seems to both poo poo my drinking but also scold me so I don't really have any productive help  I have a therapist I've been working with and I'm going to bring this up to my medical doctor when I go home in a week   Old College Try is a good one Thank you  Thank you  Thank you   I text her later and asked her if being affectionate at this point would be a bad idea for her recovery and she replied "I don't know  I don't want to think about anything right now  I love you "  She's telling you with words and behavior to not pressure her  When I was barely sober  needed time to figure out who I was and how to build a sober  happy life  You might be very distracting by putting pressure on her to be sexual when she has told you she doesn't want to deal with it right now  Please respect this fragile time in her life   I gotta be honest   I'm here just sobbing  I don't want to drink but I don't know how to get past this moment    I played the tape out and I will not drink  2016 was so bad for me  moving across the country  relapsing after 3  years      Come the fuck on 2017    I'm done  And I am so ready and willing to move forward with my life  Once I'm home from my christmas break I will be going to my regular doctor at the university clinic about it  I hope my life improves because it is pretty shit right now  I only started drinking heavily within the last 6 months or so  Everything just fell apart all at once and very rapidly  I had my apartment flood  lost my couch and rug  lost all of the deposits  had to fight for weeks to get out of the lease while being essentially homeless  lived on couches   my long term girlfriend and I split up rather abruptly  and then I had the worst semester of my entire academic career  So hopefully all I can do is go up    I'm staying in too  Home alone and feeling a bit lonely and depressed but I am sober  This is the first NYE I have been sober in   well  I couldn't even tell you how long  I think I need to work on building a social network  It's great that I'm sober but I can t sit home alone every night either  Anyways  happy new years everyone  I'd rather stay in and watch Three Stooges and Twilight Zone episodes but I'm going to my friend's party  I have no inclination or temptation to drink  The last time I drank this past Monday has supplied me with lasting memories of the negativities to keep me off forever  I hope    But one day at a time  I'll show up with my mug of tea and snacks to share tonight and probably head back home before midnight  I'll see you all here or tomorrow  sober again    How you doing  I'd also post to  r OpiatesRecovery   Sounds like you handled it well and your feelings are totally understandable  Just wanted to add though that it is  possible  your friend is really trying to be smart  protective and do the right thing   even though he is obviously getting it wrong  Only you know if it's that or if he's really an insensitive fucker  But I'm sure it will be obvious in time  With you over here  You got this  friend  I'd already made the decision to not drink tonight and I'll do it with you     A stronger man than I could ever be  After a nasty 5 day binge and extreme anxiety and aches  I will not drink with you today  I am so ready   Cancelled on the NYE Party I was invited to  and now I'm sitting here feeling like a depressed piece of crap   Also been suffering for horrible stomach cramps and off and on headaches   Normal withdrawal stuff   It's a week  would I still be experiencing this  I struggled with very similar feelings  Recently my relapse was just one big denial train  I'm here if you need to talk   Honestly staying home is the best option  fuck spending a night with all the new years drinkers  They don't know what the fuck they are doing  I'll be slammin natty ice all night on my couch  about as comfy as you can get I'm worried about a sip of champagne at midnight with the group I am celebrating with   I will be drinking craft sodas and tonic waters all night but I will get a glass of champagne around 11 55   I am driving and have no problem telling people I don't want to drink tonight but I'm worried there will be some pushing like "it's just a glass of champagne"   My plan is to hold it and put it down right away after midnight     I'm sure I can do it so I'm going to not be drinking tonight with all of you  Thanks  Granted  this is easier said than done  but I think you need to pack your shit and sleep on a friend's couch until you can get yourself situated   At this point  what is the point in staying   If you're unhappy  not upsetting the applecart is not a good reason to stay  You just echoed what I just posted   you're not alone   If that's any comfort  Progress made in the last year and one thing I'm hopeful about in the future   OMG man  I am so sorry   My friend here says it sounds unusual that he'd be put down for this   Hold out hope      Nice one  I'm a kiwi  Where are you hiking  I hope you have a wonderful trip  I'll either be dead or sober in a year You find out who your friends are in sobriety  The hard way   No problem  Im trying to convince myself that a positive outlook makes things easier  That was just me trying to look on the bright side  Lol glad i could send a smile your way Hanging out with anyone who is abusing alcohol sounds miserable to me  I avoided people and places that were risky  There's more to recovery than simply not drinking  So do you know if it's fear of eating associated feeling of physical pain when eating lack of actual hunger  Thank you  I'll keep that in mind I will do this  thank you    I haven't had a lot of drawbacks to my drinking  but I know for certain there aren't many benefits either  especially in the long term  Yes well if you work through the program you will learn who your real friends are  The more you surround yourself with other alcoholics the more you will realize you're not alone and there are others who can relate to your disease  So glad to hear you're being proactive  fellow natural ice drinker here  can comfirm    very comfy also love weed too I'm so sorry that you are sad   I know over on the SMART recovery chat they are having a NYE party if you are feeling lonely   I don't know if that's okay to post under the rules but I am hopping between here and there       What's the future like  Good  glad our experience can be of assistance   That's why we are here     You're not alone   We are all here  Party started and I'm doing good  Not drinking with you today  This is helpful  thank you   Haven't heard of the concept of maintenance drinking  That was definitely me although I would have stretches of time when I didn't drink at all  Nice to know there are others who are similar  Yup my Fear Of Missing Out is often based on the  possibilities  of an awesome night which are  if I'm to be honest wih myself  based on total fantasy  I have never ever regretted going to bed sober  I have never felt like I missed out the next day  but I have often regretted going out drinking  This   Not to say your current friend is a terrible person  but there were many people who I was friends with because we drank together   When I stopped drinking  some of my friends were still there and we still enjoyed hanging out with each other  and some of my friends "moved on"  and that's okay   It can be tough  and some of your closest friends may not be there when the dust settles  but focus on you right now  and the friends that stick will understand that and still work to include you in what they're doing  and some of it may involve others drinking  but a lot of it will not   Good luck  stay strong   One day at a time  and NYE is a hard day for everyone  Oh  and not drinking with you tonight  I am a runner and I squat as well     True  Facebook too for me  taking a break from social media works wonders sometimes  If that statistic is accurate  then I'm one of the 20  that hasn't relapsed  I don't take the first drink  If we don't take the first drink  we won't relapse    What's the point  I have a wonderful  happy sober life that I wouldn't trade for anything  I couldn't stay sober  though  without lots of help  especially in the early years  Therapy and AA helped me when I struggled   I won't be drinking tonight   For the next couple of weeks   r

like he was just looking out for you and had your best interests at heart  Try not to be too bothered  and have a convo about it with him to clear the air in the next few days  I'm sure it's not easy for your friends to deal with your lifestyle change  I'm still experiencing the same thing 8ish months into my attempts to quit  Just know that your true friends have your back  If this guy ends up not being one  then it'll free up time for you to spend with your real friends   I was definitely thinking about that for tomorrow  I have some free time  Tonight i dump the smokes in water before bed    can't beat the 6  and 50 cents a can my man  wishin I had some ganja too though Have a safe and Happy New Year  Ohay automod   3 I knew we hired you for a reason  This is strangely aggressive  especially since you don't know the friend  Lol Congrats  Thanks for letting me see into the future   I will not drink today  Welcome and don't feel shy to post   I have found this group to be the most supportive people ever   I am sorry you are feeling sad and isolated   I too drank because of social anxiety but then without any inhibitions I acted like a complete ass and have embarrassed myself and family and friends more times than I can count   I refuse to live like that anymore   If you are able  I'm reading the Naked Mind and it's really helping me    Sounds to me like you are having trouble with your real world problems and keep reverting to escapism in order to avoid the negative feelings of reality   The fact that you say "I can't explain but I have to play something     " means you are 100  using video games as a mind numbing drug to take you away from your issues  You have trained your brain to the point where gaming becomes a reflex when the going gets tough  which is a habit you must break now   Your grades are suffering  your life is suffering  and your future will be a bad one  Face your issues instead of running  I would highly recommend you start a small goal which is something like "14 days of no gaming"  This includes no gaming  no watching videos streams on gaming  no gaming message boards  etc  Fight through the withdrawal symptoms and learn to be at peace with yourself through boredom  There are many other hobbies you can have that do not have the addictive properties of gaming    Alrighty  I'm at home  Ordered some Chinese  and will probably rent a movie and drink some tea  My friend invited me out tonight  and just texted me again urging me to join  I thought about it  but I'm just not in the mood  I'm not necessarily happy  and I'm not sad  I feel blah  I could see going out just making wish I were drinking so I'd prefer to avoid that tonight  I've felt kinda dizzy and tired today  not really sure why  But I am looking forward to getting a good nights rest tonight  and kicking tomorrows ass   Happy New Year PG  I'll be on and off of here tonight  Mom's sick  Hope you have a nice evening  Thank you  I'm glad that I can find support in thus group  I've noticed improvements already  I just have had a hell of a week Someone else mentioned clonodine    it's just a blood pressure med  but it has this amazing effect of making a lot of the withdrawal symptoms go away  Just keep in mind that it will lower your BP quite a bit and you might get light headed or passout when you stand up    I should add   a little alcohol can help with symptoms as well  but don't do this for more than a few days    After day 4 5 it's all downhill  Keep in mind that when you workout it makes your body produce endorphins  which are very similar to morphine  think endo morphine  and can help symptoms a lot    Good move on getting off the opiates  Those things are just    evil    Oh  one more thing about clonodine   it's not controlled and is not addictive  There is zero abuse potential  If you take it for a long time and suddenly quit taking it  you may have high BP for a little  so be sure to not take it too long  and if you do  taper off and watch your BP   Most patents don't have issues with this  but I figured I'd mention it anyhow    Any questions feel free to PM me  Thank you for sharing  I fear the same for myself  I am going to try this year to be sober  or at least make a solid effort  I know the ramifications of getting caught drinking  I just have to keep telling myself the penalty of drinking and getting caught far out ways whatever good time I might miss  Maybe I'll just be the DD for my friends  Be something helpful for them  Breaking Bad is the best  I'll check out Red Oaks   We can do it  I would also like to know the answer to this  Help me OP wan kenobi    What sounds boring is hanging out with intoxicated people  I'd have more fun at home alone with a book or Netflix   I'm no medical professional  and I guess everybody's different  but my experience quitting cold turkey from averaging half a bottle of whiskey every night for over a year  edit  and a bit less for years before that   quitting 12 days ago has been very calm    Granted  that's equivalent to about 8 9 shots  so perhaps less than you      but some nights I did manage to down a 3 4 of a bottle  I'm a skinny guy so it tended to hit me kinda hard    Since I quit I have been sleeping a lot  practicing self soothing techniques for my anxiety  found via Google   and journaling my feelings whenever I get upset  I drink a lot of water and try to eat healthy  sometimes I just stare at the walls  but I know as long as I don't drink it doesn't really matter what I do  within reason    I hope that helps       Happy New Year to everyone   I will not drink today  or even past midnight  I pay 2 50 for a forty so a little bit more  I have one joint of some serious dank and a few grams of garden weed  Gotta fill my jars up  There is no reason to feel any anxiety or fear because you're giving up nothing  There literally isn't a single thing you enjoy right now that you can't enjoy without stinking like Marlboros and spending hundreds of dollars per month while ruining your health and co stanly interrupting your life   It takes a lot of time  money and mental energy and constantly puts stress on your body  When you quit  you will go through a couple days of discomfort and a few weeks of mental challenges and then it's all over  If you continued smoking  you would go through routine withdrawals multiple times per day for the rest of your life   Being a smoker is much  much harder than quitting  You will do it this time and you're never going to regret it  I just want to say hi and introduce myself  I signed up and subscribed yesterday    I'm not and haven't ever been addicted to porn  However  I would like to make a commitment not to watch it at all in 2017  Even though I wasn't ever addicted to it  I still recognize the bad influence it can have on people  I realized that I looked at women in a mostly sexual way and found it hard to just be friends with women  It also reduced my stamina in bed  which is the opposite of what I want long term  I've been porn free for a little over a month already and would like to keep it that way throughout 2017   Thanks for reading if you did  Its 7 15 here  and I've had my PJs on for a while  It will be sooo nice to wake up in my PJs instead of my alcohol cig  smoke smelling clothing  Not drinking with you tonight    Yeah I'm in the same boat as you pretty much  Just me myself and my inhaler lol  What state are you in  Mass   You'll make it through this  You'll wake up tomorrow and won't have to worry about the guilt or shame  you can instead wake up well rested  I thought about drinking myself tonight  and Instead im ordering some food and am going to rent a movie  Just make it through today  that's all you gotta do   Checking in  it's going well  I have alcohol in front of me but don't feel like drinking it  Dr  Sinclair  thank you   I don't want this to come off like I'm pushing AA or any other fellowship    The biggest thing I got from going to meetings were friends who are also sober  They are the biggest part of my support group and I always have sober people to do things with    I didn't do the steps  I didn't go to meetings that made me feel uncomfortable or angry in anyway  I found some that had some young people and I made friends with them    I hope you have a great new years  Make sure you talk very loud tomorrow on that 8am phone call      Kudos for 32 days            I needed lots of support in early sobriety  A therapist  rehab  education  outpatient  and involvement in AA helped me handle cravings and the tough times  Eating something sweet helped me with cravings  too  as did doing something physical  I hope you have the support you need and deserve  I didn't think it was fair to put the responsibility for my sobriety on a family member so I found it elsewhere  Have a great new year  Alright I'll bite   Lemme get a pic of the leggings  I've looked everywhere and I can not find a 40 of natty ice where I'm at  Only the natty light  but whats the point of that  only 4 2   My 40 of choice is hurricane  8  and smooth af Go somewhere no one can hear you and    SCREAM AS LOUD AS YOU CAN    Get angry at it  Let it piss you off  knowing how much control a lifeless object can have over your body    Let yourself   feel   the need to change  Sign me up plz  Let's do this  Sign meh up plz  Got a one day streak already lol I'm made myself familiar with it via research but going on day 5 tomorrow  I think it's pointless to try to obtain  I know that exercise is the biggest thing  I've never been happier than when I was a workout freak    it's just tough to re establish that routine when your brain is all funky  For me  I know it's the answer though    Other than that I'm super into vitamins supplements nutrition but I have no idea if it really helps or not  It's almost like a side addiction of mine  A lot of great suggestions so far  I particularly like this one  I can't imagine any other of the 24 meetings there today will have used it For the next couple of weeks   r cripplingalcoholism is participating in our yearly population survey   Please take a few moments to answer

find  Therapy and AA helped a great deal  Meetings gave me a safe place to go where people understood   From what I can tell your friend has good intentions  but not tact  He is throwing a drinking party  You are a little over a month sober  great job    I can see how one would think it may not be wise to 'tempt' you with an invitation to a drinking party when youre trying not to drink  If you did relapse  maybe he would have felt responsible  You are upset though   sounds like he should have handled it way better  The keeping it secret thing is crappy  Keep your head up  I wont drink with you tonight  Hey hey hey  I don't have much to say  You may feel lonely  but you're not alone  I'm a little late to reply  but so hope you're feeling better by now   slurricane    strong enough to start an engine mang    As for "progress"  Naming only one or two things could be suggested  depending how many people are there  so no one monopolizes  I think we sometimes forget about how far we've come   I know the fact that i hate it  i know that i need to change  Just saying   It is  Thank you  TBH  that guy doesn't sound like such a good friend to me   Maybe he's more a drinking buddy or party friend   Either way  I am sorry that you are feeling hurt and left out   that is one of the worst feelings and I can understand why you're pissed  I would be as well   I really have no good advice but to say that I think you are certainly entitled to feel the way you do and I think that recognizing it's a trigger and still not drinking is really strong and smart of you     P S   I'm chugging a coconut La Croix  what flavor is yours       Good  I am very please to hear things are the same  if not better  and not worse    Yeah  things are pretty good  I have a horrid sinus infection and the antibiotics are making pee out of my ass which is miserable  but the sinus infection is going away   Watching the Wild vs Blue Jackets game a Clemson vs Ohio State game at the moment   Enjoy the rest of your night  Thanks man   just thanks  Read your comment and decided to do just that  Thank you   You have bigger problem on your hands than the DUI  I am not in your marriage but it sounds torturous and painful  DUI is expensive  embarrassing and stays on your record for life but you need help and support in this moment of your life  I got a DUI my self 2 years ago and felt absolutely horrible  The alcohol education classes that I had to take were completely useless and total waste of time but there was one good thing that the counselor said  "Look deep down in you and find out what makes you drink"  boredom  shitty friends  way to escape  and I have the feeling that your marriage may be the root of your drinking  Happy NY and good luck   Continue with your actions so he can look to you when he realizes that the problem lies with alcohol   I don't need to know him to know that he's not a good friend  Friends lift us up when we are down  support us  include us and love us  They don't go out of their way to exclude us because of a healthy new lifestyle    If he were truly a friend  he would have asked him outright and had an honest conversation about it    As someone who's struggled with so called friendships through the years  I completely relate and identify with OP  That feeling of being left out  and excluded and like you don't belong brings me right back to those feelings I had before I got sober  Obviously OP is rather upset by it all too  It's a shitty feeling  and we don't deserve to feel that way from someone who we thought was a good

meaning people happens all the time  and thanks to our friend conformation bias  it seems even more common when we look for it    Sometimes however  people might not mean well and be trying to make some sort of indirect point  Either way  full steam ahead  I had an experience of someone meaning well and pissing me the fuck off that I recall often  When at dinner with a friend  when I was still only about a year sober  the waitress came over and asked if id like to hear the beer list  My friend cut me off and exclaimed "oh no  He's not allowed to drink "  I wasn't embarrassed by my sobriety  I was embarrassed that my friend felt he had to babysit me  Like it was only through the constant guarding of others that I managed to scrape out a year already  dodging bullets every day  Wanna know what I did  I calmly said that I was an adult and could do whatever I wanted  I asked the waitress to hear the list  I ordered a beer I thought sounded good  Then I let the beer sit there on the table all dinner  like a big hot pile of shit  He kept uncomfortably looking at it  and I didn't think about it twice  Because I chose not to drink it  just as I had managed to do for a year before and three years since  We live in a world full of liquor  if proximity or availability is the only thing keeping us sober  we've already relapsed  Stay strong  Six months sober and my first sober NYE in nearly 30 years  Congratulations to all and to all a safe and happy New Year  Just drink vodka in the shower with the shower water as chaser  And if we're being honest here fuck the food  That does nothing but slow a night down   Lee I follow you closely on SD but rarely respond    thx for your message tonight  I'm lost in Cincinnati and very alone right now    Playing   walking my dog too    It's new years day morning in Australia and I'm about to take him for a walk x   Also  I used to love to paint and draw  It's something I'm starting to do again    I used to read for hours in bed at night  I haven't done that for so long  So writing this reminds me that I want to start reading again  I love getting lost in a good book  An inspiration  Ringing in the New Years with that monkey off your back  I was suffering a lot early 2016  I feel like a different person now  Keep going man   3  You did it  So happy for you  Let's keep going in 2017   Wish I could agree with the two week part  it seemed much easier during the first two than it does now  Regardless  I'm gonna pull through and so are you  We've got this  Awh I love this post  Your little get together sounds like it's going to be a great time  Have a very happy new year  and a happy birthday too  Thank you for sharing   No  Let's all go the fuck to bed    its the safest place for us  Well for me anyway  To be fair  I've lit cigarettes backwards while stone cold sober  it still sucks Over 25 wasted  wasted New Year's Eves  I agree 100  Eh I'm okay with a slower tonight if it makes tomorrow at all easier  Plus my stomach is so empty I don't think it's gonna hurt too much  I'll still be blasted  If it can prolong how long I last I'm cool with it  Plus I'm just hungry too haha I used Kratom daily for 7 years  since I  was 16  because I could not imagine feeling happiness from anything but drugs  Even when I had gotten clean from it and was exercising daily I still felt miserable  It was only when I realized I lacked the happy chems that most people have in normal amounts did I actually get the medication that has allowed me to enjoy life    I take a drug that keeps my dopamine from breaking down  Welbutrin   allowing me more motivation juice to get things done  Additionally I take Lamictal which acts as a neurprotectant against the degeneration of brain tissue that depression causes    Note that kratom brings pleasure by stimulation of the mu opioid receptors and unfortunately chronic use downregulates these receptors  a bad thing when the kind of people that tend to use opioids chronically already have less receptors than average   meaning they experience less pleasure in general and have a higher sensitivity to pain    The best way to produce natural opioids is through exercise and there is also some evidence to suggest that use of opioid antagonists  like narcan  in small doses can actually upregulate the receptors    Good luck and I recommend you stay away from ssris because they seem to be bullshit   Congrats   Have a peaceful night and a happy New Year  Oh no   I'm sorry to hear that   I'll glad she has you   Sending Cyber Hugs  Love it  Think about it as a victory for your sobriety and not a loss for your social life  I stay home on NYE and St Patrick's day specifically to avoid all the trouble and drunken shenanigans that are a byproduct of the celebrations  Boring  Maybe  But it gives me personal satisfaction for keeping with my beliefs and staying sober which is more important to me by a lot   This all depends on the person itself  I hate sports games  so in a social setting if I was pressured into playing I think I could be able to handle it just fine without relapsing  but it is a scary thought to think of   But everyone is different  Just having a controller in your hands  seeing the flashing lights on the screen  sitting in a chair feeling comfortable  will all trigger signals in your brain that may try and get you to relapse again    I will tell you this though  when Overwatch came out I tried it a few times and absolutely hated it  I was about 2 months into my no gaming diet  and I went over to my friends house for a party  They had a few PS4s set up and they were all playing Overwatch  They all kept telling me to play  and since I already knew I hated the game  I figured it would be harmless to play it a few times with them because I knew I wouldn't care about it once the party was over  So we played all night  and when the party was over I still hated the game   The next day I was at Best Buy and while I was browsing the electronics I saw the Overwatch display  In this weak moment of mine  I thought it might be fun to casually play the game a little bit and learn how to be at least average at it so when I do go over to my friends house again I have something we can all do together and have fun  Because even though I disliked the game  it was still fun playing all night with them regardless of what game we even played  It felt like harmless social entertainment and they all were pretty good at the game so I wanted to fit in better   So the first few weeks I casually learned the game  There were no issues  I played a game here and there  I learned a couple of characters and figured I was competent enough to at least keep up with them  I wanted to see how good I was though  so I eventually tried out ranked to see how I stacked up   Well  this quickly turned into full blown zombie addiction mode where I proceeded to play 12 14 hours a day for the next month  Even the game I hated so much  got me  After this I realized I just can't handle games no matter what  Congratulations  My first sober NYE in over 25 myself  Happy New Year  This post right here  A old friend of mine who is still actively abusing alcohol  tried to tell me my drinking wasn't that bad or I can always just cut down when I first stopped drinking  I think when I quit it made him examine his own drinking habits and he didn't want to accept that it was not healthy or normal  I love the activity in this sub the past few hours  Fuckin cheers  pal  I am pretty happy because I have two handles of whiskey  My dog  My cigarettes and horror films  This is the best NYE I would hope for  Well done    When you wake up you'll be refreshed and feeling great  Great post  Happy new year I'm right there with you guys just far behind your progress  It's been weird being actually sick during withdrawal  Sort of a mental fuck  Relaxing with meds teas humidifiers and praying for some sleep  Watching some CFB now and will be rooting on my Giants at 1 tomorrow  Hoping to get some mental reprieve soon  20  is a far cry from 0   No one said it would be easy  But  those are way better stats than I was expecting   What a great evening  which will quietly transition into the first sober day of the Year   I'm with you  Wonderful start to the New Year  Wishing you joyous and sober 2017  Good to hear  stay sober  squirrel  Good for you for not drinking  and I won't drink with you tonight  I faced my coworkers after my shitfaced xmas party by saying sorry I was such as ass the last time we were together  I was so surprised by how many people expressed a desire to quit drinking  Good luck   Challenge yourself  but take it one step at a time    I think cancelling on the party was a wise decision  After the initial withdrawal window  usually a few days to a week for me each time I've tried to stop   I experienced post acute withdrawal symptoms  PAWS  months after  I did a lot of research on PAWS in the first weeks  and now when I'm not feeling that great  I don't feel as bewildered as I did in the past  Congratulations on making it a week and happy New Year  Great job the way you handled this   crying instead of drinking    Well done and be proud of yourself   I think you'll be moving on friendship wise when you want to  I had dreams for months  The relief that I didn't drink was so great that I kind of miss the drinking dreams  Stay strong and enjoy this sober New Years with me  I will not drink today  For anyone outside of your relationship  it's very hard to make a judgement call like this  and all they can do is base it on their own personal experiences mixed with your summary above     That being said  it sounds like she's trying to be as kind as possible while asking you to give her space as she works out her own things   "she said she needed to get her brain rewired before us picking up where we left off"   I would honor that  and be comfortable that she knows you're there to support her when she needs you  but for now give her the space she's requested and proceed with your life  10 45 am on the first right now  My friends are all either hungover or still drunk  It was so hard not giving into peer pressure last night but I made it through  Thanks to everyone here for giving me some place to check up on in the night   Thank you  you too   https   imgur com FaFDBJG  I don't know why my legs look two different sizes  and no  I don't normally dress in obnoxious neon bullshit  My roommate gave them to me when we were both fucked up recently  I'm trying to quit so I can pass a drug test to be a firefighter EMT     How can smoking be more important than that  I hate who I've become sometimes  Sounding so weak  I need to stop   I will stop  In the same boat my man   That's wonderful  Starting the New Year off right  And I'm sorry you're not having the greatest evening   hang in there  She is on disability so she has some form of medicare   When I got out of rehab  I watched Breaking Bad in under 7 days  I'm now starting Breaking Netflix  Thanks  Maybe not malintent but definitely misdirected   Love it    I think a big factor in this is how long you have been drinking that amount  Could you let us know how long it's been  And best wishes Yes   Smoked my last one at 11 50pm  crushed the rest of the pack and threw it out  I'm done  We can do this    I agree  I'm particularly bothered that I wasn't even given the option to come  And not that he was particularly concerned about my sobriety  he just didn't want me  gasp    the alcoholic   to end up drunk at his party   I'm a big Giants fan too  Where you from  awesome work to those you stayed clean throughout this year  NC  Part of the reason I think I have the fuckin cold  The weather can't make up its mind here  we go from 28 70 in a day sometimes  Clinks your nonexistent champagne flute  My first sober NYE in 28 years  Cheers to us  NDV      Woo   There's a difference between court ordered rehab  and wanting to be clean  I've been to rehab  most people  including myself  were forced there  either by the government  court  or significant others spouses    I've reached a point that I WANT to stop  Not because someone is telling me  Not because I got in trouble with the law  But because I'm sick of what it's doing to my life    Actually wanting to stop versus being told to stop is where you separate yourself from that statistic  Now your chances of remaining sober are much higher  This made me smile      You to     Let's rock 2017  My emotions were a roller coaster the first few days          Have any CBT  grounding or anxiety tools  Been drinking in general since I was 19  i just turned 24   I started drinking this much about 2 years ago I agree with you  OP is mad for being abandoned and "left out " but at 37 days I can't imagine going to a NYE party where everyone is drinking  I think the friend truly had OP's best interest in mind here   Where are you located  My "friends" kind of pulled the same stunt  so if you want someone to chat with and ring in the new year  I'm just going to be hanging around Oh wow I had no idea there was a survey  sure am glad a post finally brought it to attention  Happy new year   I don't think you damaged your brain    Current neuroscience has found that simple things like exercise and group therapy can have a profound impact in healing the brain    There is no try  there is only do or do not  watching starwars right now    Seriously though  if you want to quit then you're going to need to quit completely  Delete your dealers number    What happened to months 6   7   Deal  I think that is your old username  Anyways    I know who you are  I will not drink today   You hit the nail on the head on all points  A side note  I haven't been able to quit  Be better than both of us  For me and yourself  Holidays centered around alcohol are the hardest  I want to go out and have fun  and instead I'm working and sober and feel lonely  Despite that  though  I'll be sober tonight  Not just am  but will  I will remember my first night of 2017   Do something that makes you happy that doesn't involve smoking weed    Buy yourself something instead  go exercise  post on this subreddit  repeat  That's what I have been doing when I have cravings and it's helped for the most part    Good luck and happy new year friend  Awesome    Happy new year  Happy new year  I can't wait to see how I feel next New Years  Happy you feel different this year  Ugh the number of shitty things I've done because "New Years" or "St Patricks Day" or  y'know  just "Friday"    We made the right choice tonight for sure   Never posted here  This is day 3 of me not drinking and my grandfather passed away this morning  I wasn't really close to him but my dad who my girlfriend and I are staying with is pretty upset  I am gonna take them to meet some of her friends at a bar later to ring in the new year   Normally this is a time when I would get drunk to help "deal with it" but the truth is my grandpa was an alcoholic since he was a teenager up until the last 5 or 6 years when he had to stop or die and his passing is even more of a reminder of why I don't need to drink   I'm gonna be there for my dad and have a good night with my girlfriend and the bonus is they have a free dd  I feel good right now  I'm not gonna drink tonight  other than gingerale lol  because not only do I not need to  but the truth is I really don't want to   Happy New Year everyone To add to this   I am on Day 8 and I have found my cravings only last a few hours at the most and then I forget and move on to something else  Try to remember that    you won't feel like you want to call your dealer forever   You know who I am  I'm not sure if I should be more worried about that or what tomorrow is gonna bring  It's hard to speak in the " i " on this one  I  had tunnel vision when I wanted to get sober  When I was on day 37 I was focused on my sobriety not what others were doing  If I didn't get invited to a party it was a "blessing"   it meant God was looking  out for me    I know AA doesn't really take the holidays off  but in your experience  is Al Anon the same   Al Anon meetings would follow school closings during bad weather  that I do know  When my aunt died this last year  I immediately felt grateful for AA and meetings  In light and in tragedy  sobriety is amazing and I feel fortunate to have it  I will not drink with you today   Man  I wish there was a way to get more awareness out      p If it's just ashes I'd still drink the beer  Started today so as not to be hungover in the morning   Start the year off right    Beautiful southern Nevada  My girlfriend has an inhaler  I'll be hitting the shit out of it  Haha  How are you  Still coughing up lungs  Relapsed on the 29th  went on a two day binge  Been clean today  but I got  10 that I'm trying not to spend on a bag   This is only my experience  so take it with a grain of salt  please do take the detox seriously  but it honestly might not be as bad as you think it will  I was drinking that much and sometimes more every day by the time I quit  I was at that many drinks for 6 months a year  and didn't have any issues with withdrawals at all    It's definitely best to start with medical advice  being brutally honest  I started by talking to my doctor  who referred me to an outpatient clinic  and it was the best thing I've ever done for myself  Wishing you the best in the new year  I hope to hear from you soon that you've come through this and are on the road to sobriety  I won't drink with you     I would venture to say those folks that made those negative remarks are either in denial themselves or cannot understand where we are coming from    Glad you're here   Let yourself cry  it's ok   You don't have to know how to get past this moment  this moment will get past you   I'm here holding space for you  Good on you  It's hard but have that strength  Since I've stopped drinking  waking up not feeling like shit is amazing  Keep it going  Keep it strong  We've all got today  I've smoked skoal out of a bong on a dare   Yeah i somehow still got a cough  Its not terrible but I still have this gross shit coming out when I cough  I'm just physically beat too  So tired all the time  Hi  I would just like to ask if you are me  I'm at a year clean tomorrow and I filled out my time exactly the same way  Only difference is I taught my ferret to walk on a leash  I'm staying in and celebrating with my kiddos tonight  Nothing feels better than being sober and present with these two amazing people    Feeling tremendously grateful for SD  I found you wonderful sobernauts a little more than 2 yrs ago and soon I'll be celebrating two sober  healing  harrowing trips around the sun thanks to SD  therapy  and moving my feet when my head got too tangled     It just sucks when you have no money after rent and bills Tbh I've been seeing this shit for weeks but didn't notice today was the last day  I half assed did it on my phone just now but would have done it more thoroughly if I were near a computer   OP please do this   Thank you Agreed  We can't expect "normies" to know everything about what we're going through and what we can and can't handle  If I didn't know better  I'd probably have the same misconceptions as OP's friend    OP is early on in his her recovery  so it's totally reasonable to have the reaction he she had  but as time moves on and the sobriety days add up  situations like this are great teaching moments to let our friends and family in on the truths surrounding addiction and recovery    That said  I'm sorry you're being left out OP  We're all here to celebrate your sobriety with you tonight   Harvard has a 5  acceptance rate  That doesn't mean a kid with a 4 0   good test scores has just a 5  chance    Addiction recovery rates are low  across the board  But it's not a lottery  It doesn't matter if the recovery rate is 5  or 95   Whether you make it or not is entirely up to you   Sweatpants are on  the cooking has begun and I'm ready to ring in the new year full and happy  Let's do this SD  Declined a party invite but they were only asking to be polite they knew I wasn't going  Felt good to get asked though     I'm home from spell early  Sober  Maybe going to a guy frowns house I haven't seen in years  probably will get flaked on  So I'm a little antsy to see what will happen Happy New Year  u Phredex     I'm safely tucked up in bed  tummy full of nibbles and soft drinks after spending tonight at home with my three lovelys  Night night x  Not drinking today i'm staying in too  i dont want to get killed driving home and i dont really have anyone to spend the new years with  i ran this morning in the rain in preparation for a half marathon and i drove home sad that my rest day is tomorrow and i'll just be stuck by my lonesome trying not to go crazy until monday when i get to run again   Take care out there  We're only a few taps away on your phone if you need to check in again  Hang in there   Isn't it nice when at 1 am you're not who they're looking for   Great job  Congratulations   Welcome to sober 2017  I know I'm not far along  but I sent my boyfriend off to his NYE party and I'm in my pajamas playing the Witcher 3  I'm okay with this    However  I'm super tired and might not make it to midnight lol  Is there a non alcoholic option for a toast  So like  come hang out with me and we can walk our animals together  Sounds like a good time to me   Also congrats on a year clean  That's such a long time  Congratulations on your first soberversary  this is great news   Wishing you a fantastic 2017 love n hugs x Sounds like a good plan  Yeah  I've been there   For me it didn't turn out that badly  that particular person was drunk and it barely registered   I remembered when I behaved like him  I was more worried about what I said that pissed someone off while I was drunk   You shouldn't feel like shit  you stuck up for yourself and did great   Congratulations and I won't drink with you  Hi  are you OK  If I didn't feel 100  solid I'd leave  Because I know that if I do something I'm just 99  sure of 100 times I'll fail once   It's the difference between gambling and investing   Welcome  You've got one hell of a journey ahead of you  Just remember that it's worth it  and so are you  Well  it's all perspective  I was once a chronic relapser  I'd make it 30 60 days and then go back out for months  sometimes years  This time  I tried sobriety differently  coming here to SD and AA  and have almost 7 months  and I don't feel worried at all about making it to a year    I've also met people through AA who have relapsed after serious  time   One in particular that I can think of was sober for 17 years  then relapsed and stayed drinking for 7 years  now has almost 2 years sober again  Honestly it doesn't matter how much time any of us have   relapse is something we'll always have to be careful about   That said  the statistic probably makes a good point in that the longer time you have  probably the easier it gets to keep going   Yea   Im netflixed out  I cant wait for a selection change  I wont be hanging with intoxicated ppl necessarily  I just moved to the west coast and we would be playing games online  I dont think i could handle sitting in the same room with a bunch of drunks  Especially nye drunks      Boy it sure did for me   It took me about 3 weeks to balance out  although I have to admit I really wasn't good at dealing with anxiety   Turns out its one of those skills I didn't have that I covered by drinking  Thank you for sharing this  Are you in any danger   Do you need someone to talk to or do you need emergency personnel  Fun fact  the concept of peer pressure was invented by cats in ancient Egypt   Congratulations   Well done  You kind of look like Negasonic Teenage Warhead  You are rocking it  What a wonderful idea    Happy new year Yeah  I can relate to that for sure   Would you care to expand   Also  the chat below is a good real time conversation   Are you in immediate physical danger  My emotions were a wreck for at least 2 months  It takes time  On the upside  if I didn't like how I was feeling I only had to wait 20 minutes til the next mood swing  You can do it   But only if you actually are done and want to quit   You have to concede to the fact that you will never  ever smoke another cigarette for the rest of your life     If that's truly what you want  you will succeed    So glad for this special check in  My husband just got home from a long day and opened a beer  For a split second  I wanted one too  But then I remembered why I won't  So  I'm still not going to drink tonight  Did something bad happen or just a bunch of stuff piling on  So happy for your post  I am lucky to get almost 6 hours of sleep at night  I would really like more  you give me hope    Do it for your friend  I'm terribly co dependent  but it's helped me   Just a suggestion and what helped me the first time  spend your  10 on some liquor and avoid crystal for a week or so  Then try kick down the liquor    Remember who you used to be  and don't beat yourself up  You're worth more than that  Stay out your head   I should have thought this through better  I live in another country  and I usually visit in the summer  So I'm stuck here  but I am not drinking  If things get too bad I'll just go to bed  i just relapsed after my 40 days over  christmas  youre not alone  shit happens  be aware of your breathing and where you are right now  youre alive n human  we all make mistakes  now just eat some cupcakes and be kind to yourself  Did you go for the evaluation  Same here  glad to know that I am not alone  Great post  I have recently re discovered creative writing  I used to love writing short stories  poetry  even attempted a novel when I was about 16  I'm sure it was terrible    I'm fairly artistic in several ways   I like to do photography and draw a little  too    Last month I randomly came up with a story idea  too late for NaNoWriMo though   and I've been slowly writing on it ever since  I'm up to 20 000 words and it's just awesome to get lost in the characters  I'll be working on it tonight as I wait for the new year   Man that sucks   I've had some wonderful fights I've totally forgotten about   I've actually had my wife waiting for me to apologize for something and I really had no recollection of what   Not doing that now is certainly a big advantage to sobriety    You are so welcome here  as am I   It took me years of lurking before I made my first post and I am glad I finally did because posting and commenting here has been a far bigger help in me staying sober than anything else I had tried on my own   Best of luck to you and hope to see you around    I understand where she is coming from in regards to  sort of  ending your relationship  I have done this many times myself  I felt that my eating disorder was stronger than my relationship s  and I wanted to put all my energy into my disorder rather than the relationship    if that makes sense lol  The eating disorder even makes you think that you don't deserve a relationship or deserve to be happy  I also felt strongly that I was a burden to every one around me  Your GF might feel this same way    Like the other poster said  you can't help someone who doesn't want to be helped  You can be there for her to support her  but you can't do the work for her  You can text her everyday and ask her how she's doing    just knowing that one person out there cares about her will help  Remind her that she is beautiful and worth it   As for treatment    she needs to see a therapist  at least once a week  I don't know what her financial situation is but this is really crucial to getting better  She won't be able to do it on her own  There a lot of resources online  if you live in the Canada   www nedic com has a lot of good resources  And https   www nationaleatingdisorders org if you live in the states   I wouldn't have wanted someone to do this to me when drunk   its not very nice   Have you had any success fighting cravings before   If so  what worked for you  Ok   then it's just a matter of finding a place that takes it  there are hundreds that do  the last time I went I was on disability and have Medicare call the addiction hotlines  do a Google Search  you will find plenty of options Agree 100   don't think I've ever heard anyone say it's a good idea to be around alcohol in early recovery  Smart   If I was at a party   someone handed me a drink I didn't want  I'd drink it  Can't waste alcohol  right  But if that person had instead handed me a Pepsi I didn't want I'd have no problem setting it down   walking away    My addict mind assigned far too much value to alcohol   I would dump it  It doesn't sound honest  loving  or kind to me  As bad their behavior sounds  each group is self governed  If the group conscious agrees with that meeting style then it's ok   My ferret does get along with cats really well    Also thanks  How much clean time do you have  Feel free to scroll back to my early posts  I was all over the place  And it's very normal  I think many of us have covered anxiety with alcohol  For me  I did it for years  Once we aren't drinking anymore  it hits full force  Thankfully  it does get better  I'm not saying I never have anxiety  I do  And when it hits  it's still the full force  I can't stop thinking about it kind of anxiety  I've found it doesn't last as long and I am able to quiet my mind much easier   You can do this  Don't wait for the cravings to go away   prepare in advance for how to handle them  Think of times situations when you automatically reach for a cigarette  Those will be the hardest times  Replace that trigger with something else  like drinking water  chewing gum  going for a walk  or whatever  and soon the habit will be replaced  Its not easy  but YOU can do it    I did it  It's 1 24am on 1st Jan 2017 and I didn't have one drop of alcohol tonight  even though I was offered a completely free bottle of wine  and then a glass of someone else's wine  a few hours ago   I had a great night in  crazy tired now so gonna go to bed  Happy New Year  everyone  Oh no  Sorry to hear   What's going on  Going to bed early is a great escape route   Best part is that there's always a brand new day waiting on the other side      I only passed out in front of my family once  I have some unnamed sleeping condition    OK   We would like people to only post when they are sober  out of respect for those who are sober and struggling right now   Can you please try and post tomorrow morning when you are sober   drinking fizzy apple juice out of a champagne glass   So this is what the people of Bel Air be livin' like    We've got a bottle of the same in the fridge  Happy NY  I have been really lucky to be off work this week while I go through the first few days  I told my doctor  but he didn't prescribe anything  I am sleeping a lot  exercising  going to one meeting a day  drinking fizzy stuff and tea  eating chips and chocolate   basically babying myself for a week  I am taking acetaminophen  paracetamol  for headaches  but nothing else  Good luck   you can do this  Not drinking with you today  Last year I cried myself to sleep  I hated myself  and couldn't breath properly for weeks  I never want to be in that place again  Hopefully 2017 doesn't suck as much as 2016  I'm in a similar place  I feel like I've lost the love of my life and I'm here grinding my gears while they've already moved on  How is it so easy for some people to fall in love  it took me 30 years    The one positive thing I take from it is that I will never not be present again and I will never let things slip away again they way they did  Good luck getting through new year's  Not "I don't get to drink"  but "I don't have to drink" really sat well with me   Happy New Year   I'm going to jump in the ocean in New England tomorrow morning   Right now HOT yoga sounds like the greatest invention ever   By the way I had some people that didn't want to hang out with me after I stopped   But they really weren't friends  it turns out    I'm glad you're here   SD has been the kindest  most encouraging group of people ever since I quit lurking  too   Stopping drinking has turned my life around   Happy new year's Eve  and I will not drink with you today  Did it  Made it through three pubs  two bands  a very disorganised countdown and a semi cautious walk home  Huge huge relief right now  Happy new year guys A little over six months  Longest I've ever had   Lol  That's priceless  Better than me  last time I got out of detox I lasted about an hour  I hope you're right about the way you spend NYE   I'm sober  happy  and surrounded by family while participating in a great group of supportive people that take time out to help perfect strangers   Happy 2017  Wow this is exactly my sister situation  She has been drinking heavily for the last 2 years broke up with her long term fiancee  was recently fired out of a job only after a few months because of drinking  She was seeing a psychologist but quit that and although she admitted once that "she drinks more than normal" I feel she is in overall denial  I also live far and see her 1  2 a year but if she continues this way she may not make it in the next 5   10 years  she is only 32  I'm sticking it at home as well  I fly out of town tomorrow afternoon and am looking forward to waking up with a clear head  and when it's at its worst  not waking up to the fear and anxiety of what may have happened the night before  I have lots of plans and stuff I want to accomplish this coming year  and starting it out on the right foot sounds good to me  Happy New Year to you  It is 100 percent okay to stay in   New Years has already come and gone where I am   Do I regret not going out  Do I regret waking up without a hangover and regrets  No way  It's just one night  It will pass  just like the feelings of sadness loneliness isolation will pass  I'm glad you did decide to post  I don't think it's ridiculous at all  I've been having squirrely thoughts all day  I'm not going to act on them but they are there  Being here and reading everybody's posts helps so much    Thanks  I won't drink with you today  I'm wasn't sober  fuck Thanks man     I am definitely getting there  Been hitting the gym most days of the week  and when I don't I do pullups  pushups  planks and crunches in my bedroom throughout the day to keep from sitting on my ass  Definitely appreciate all of your advice  parts stick with me and I remember our convo when I am thinking about bettering myself  In fact I was thinking about our convo earlier today  so funny that you decided to reply     I think I'll write that phrase down somewhere too   perfect summary   I need to do this so badly  I'm very sorry for your loss   My uncle died last year and I was very grateful to be able to experience it sober   I'll not drink with you  too    This is true  Headed out to get all you can eat crab legs with all the money i would have spent on booze  Congratulations on not drinking   I find that I socialize better when I'm sober  although I was very afraid of that fact   At 4 days I would've been pretty tempted    You might die  It's not likely  but it's possible  I was drinking as much or more than you and though I didn't sleep for a few days and was shaking  like a Polaroid picture  I didn't die  YMMV  of course   I just want to piggyback on the other person because they made great points   The worst part about cravings isn't that they are constantly there  it's that they come in waves and some waves are small ripples and some are massive tsunamis  I tell you this because  in my experience  you need to have a plan for when the bad cravings hit   Keep a pack of gum around  regular or nicotine gum   I used Zonnic that you can get at 7 11  it's so unpleasant to chew that it kind of worked as negative conditioning  or something else to chew on or satisfy the oral fixation  I also used sunflower seeds for this    Be willing to talk about it  tell your wife or friends or coworkers when the cravings are bad  usually they'll give you enough encouragement and support to get you through the craving   And if all else fails  come and post here before you smoke  we'll always be here for you   One thing that helped me after the first few days was telling myself that I never wanted to go through the first 3 days  the first week  the first ten days etc etc again     Good luck  You can do it  I promise you   I also can promise you this from experience  It's 100  worth it    hopefully not too late again but im down   You won't regret it  I won't drink with you tonight  Why did they text that they don't want to talk to you anymore  Your post is so inspiring  Congratulations on two years    That's pretty shitty   I don't have anything else to say   That really sucks   I had pretty bad 'friends'   Of course I never really met them  I let booze do it for me   Turns out it was bad at picking friends   I get to try again sober  and I'll be looking for better qualities in people this time   Here's to a better 2017  Lots of candy tonight y'all I'm in the same boat as you  I can go months without drinking  and having a beer and most of the time I don't even finish it   This entire week has consisted of family parties with my boyfriends and my family and both families like to drink  Then friends come over to my house an we'll drink a bottle or two of wine   Fast forward to this morning after drinking two bottles with my best friend last night  my boyfriend is pissed and thinks i have a problem  and I'm upset because I don't think I have one and I think he's getting angry over nothing    We're supposed to be having a "talk about it" kinda convo right now but now he wont talk to me about anything  so I don't know  Even at 84days i don't think I can handle being around alcohol   Cheers my Sprite Zero to that  Hot yoga  wow  I've always wanted to try that    Have a great time and Happy new year x I remember going through the phase of wanting to "test myself" around booze  In the end I discovered it was just my boozy brain trying to make it that much easier to say fuck it and drink again  This early on you need to make it as hard as possible to drink  Put as much distance between you and the nearest bottle of alcohol as you can  I hope you can work things out with your buddy  Either way have a fantastic and sober new years   Yay  You've got this buddy    More importantly than doing this for a New Years resolution    do this for you    We believe in you   EDIT  do this for you   and your family      Heyyy  I'm sick too  Ulcer related I think  Just gonna watch some rifftrax and drink some chicken broth  Cheers  I think viewing crying as weakness is exactly my problem  I love my parents  but their most common line was "we can't have a productive conversation if you're crying " Which is valid in some ways  if you're blubberingly incoherent  it's worthwhile to calm down  then  talk   But I do think it created a mindset in me that crying is useless pointless and a waste of time  Step 1 might be acknowledging that crying   does   serve a purpose  and sometimes needs to happen in order to be productive   It's definitely a scary statistic  but I agree that many of the people who relapse again and again in the first month  myself twice this year for example  skew those stats  I am fully confident at 62 days that I have a better than 20  chance of making it to a year   And really I'm not worried about that   I just need to make it to bedtime tonight    I'm alone and not drinking  Beats the alternative  I will not drink today   u avelene0186   u Choosethebiggerlife   u Lee in NY   u hexqueen  and  u Possibilitarian2015 Seriously this all brings a tear to my eyes  Did someone cut onions in my apartment   I posted my response at work after an insane cascade of thoughts that occurred from my anxiety  I always have this issue of an intense form of anxiety that occurs when I see my to do list and it takes MANY minutes if not hours to get out of it  How I get out of it is by doing 20 50 motions of lab work  I'm a graduate student   Reddit and facebook and instagram were not helping my anxiety  the amount of posts about suicide  about seeing old friends  about celebrating a year  This was my toughest year  losing a lot of drinking buddies  and definitely getting out of depression   This episode of anxiety didn't go away even after at least 200 motions of lab work  When I came home  I needed to immediately go for a 10 minute run to get out of my head  which is a sure fire technique for me  all thanks to my marathon training  but in the process of changing clothes I gave a cold shoulder to my mom  I went for a run  and was feeling a ton better  but I came home and my mom felt like I was making her feel lonely and deserting her  And when I graduate and get a job I will just forget her and she started crying a lot  It was heartbreaking  Both of us suffering with our own anxieties  our own definitions of loneliness  and our own methods of relieving the intense emotion  I consoled her  as she has for me in the past  but that realization we are both totally different people separated by 20 30 years  and yet we are so similar in our behaviors and tendencies  It was just surreal  I gave her my reasoning for running  it was either that or end our vacation together by yelling and being angry  Fortunately the misunderstanding was resolved but seeing her cry    that was tough   After that I went to my friends home because we agreed to hang out and I was going to open up our friendship  show her my musicianship  teach her some folk dance from my culture  watch some stand up comedians I like  It was about 5 hours worth of hanging out but I felt so comfortable with her and my anxieties were fairly controlled  I come to these messages and my feeling of loneliness is damn near melted away  Thank you everyone  I will post my 365 soon  Thank you  Congratulations on 2 months   Sorry to hear about your mom and your best friend  but great job staying strong   Happy 2017  So happy I resisted and held strong through both Xmas and nye  I'm sure many many here also did so and I am so happy about that   Bring on a bright new year   So happy I resisted and held strong through both Xmas and nye  I'm sure many many here also did so and I am so happy about that   Bring on a bright new year   You're not alone  we are here with you   Congrats  Before this past year my longest was 3 months  Any amount of time is a big deal because it means you aren't using  I can say at about the 8 month mark cravings disappeared  I know it's not like that for everyone but there is hope    If you ever need someone to talk to about it just message me  This has to be the best "scare the nicotine out of you" video out there   I'm with you  fuck New Years Eve   It's amateur hour at the bar  everyone thinks they're going crazy because they had three shots in an hour  I basically had 2 options  and told each one that I was going to the other one so I could just be alone   Drunk as hell right now  listening to music  and enough booze to kill an elephant   Happy New Year  Man   This just reminds me how detox F'ing sucks    So bad   Minutes feel like hours  hours feel like weeks  weeks feel like months   sheesh   Just For Today    I never have to do that again  Thank you for all the motivation  Hearing from you "from the future" is really encouraging  thank you  Ye yeeeeee  Thanks  Feels kinda cool  PM anytime if you'd like to chat  Happy New Year Hey  Could try the chat  it's in the sidebar and pretty busy tonight  I think putting your sobriety first is great  Maybe that was terrible phrasing  My mom was my best friend  Only lost one     Again I highly recommend the reading  I can completely relate to the problems you share and even though you are a woman the book is basically about relationships regardless of gender   Your friend was looking out for you  I'm very glad I don't have to do the drunken fights anymore   I'm in too  but I'm very much enjoying it at the moment   I'm planning on watching a movie as soon as my kids go to bed   If you're lonely  have you checked out the chat   The link is over in the sidebar  Wow   that sounds so hard     what I've realised is that there is no real trick  you just have to sit through the time and tolerate your feelings  there's no magic trick to it    I'm so sorry for what you're going through x What a great way to ring in the new year  SIGN ME UP PLEASE    I was visiting family for the holidays this past week which is why I have not checked in recently  but I'm still here  still clean  and laser focused for 2017  It's still 3 hours before midnight  at least here in the eastern US  so hopefully I can still make it  Thank you so much  u foobarbazblarg for all your hard work in making these challenges a success  Playing WoW  I played for a long time before I started drinking and also played for the 5 years I was a daily drunk   It's amazing how much better you are at a video game when sober  Sober sleep is the absolute best   I love it so much   I too thought I had terrible sleep problems until I quit  and now I'm so much better   I even told my doctor last week not to refill the amitriptyline I took to sleep     That doesn't sound very kind  Pretty damn mean if you ask me   It's not for him  it's for my sister  My question is whether or not her father  whose currently struggling with substance abuse  should be present and actively participate in her intervention  I'm quitting smoking starting today too  and it feels like hell on earth  but I know it's going to be worth it after a few month  Good to know I'm not alone On NYE probably good call to stay in and watch tv  When I think of any point to this holiday other than an excuse for excessive drinking  I draw a blank   Kinda bored  having to remind myself why I quit to begin with  This will be my first sober NYE in 31 years  I can do this  Fuck the zero  Fierce  Stay Strong   Checking in for the final time this month  and for 2016  61 days under my belt  2017  LET'S FUCKING GO    I have to disagree  I think he was trying to be a good friend in his own way  It might not have been what you were looking for but he did have you on his mind  Hopefully you guys can talk about it honestly and see where each of you guys are coming from  I bet you will feel proud of yourself in the morning  Happy new year  I almost forgot that it was New Year's Eve until just now   8pm local time   Amazing how priorities change when you don't plan your life around drinking  I'm happy to say that I won't be drinking tonight  Looking forward to reading your success stories in the hangover free morning  Happy New Year  fellow sobernauts  I will not drink today My own stopping story  I was drinking 1 5L  2x750ml bottles  of wine per night  and often a little more   an extra IPA  or cracking open a third bottle and then saving the remainder for the next night  Obfuscation of my actual drinking volume was an m o  of mine  I "tapered"  if you can call it that  my last night in which I "only" drank 5  high  abv  beers  I then stopped cold turkey  no meds  I was in pretty good shape  regular gym cardio work  and my withdrawal was pretty nasty  sweats  sore muscles  restless sleep  weird diarrhea  etc  Never though was I thinking I wasn't going to make it   The safe advice is to tell you if you are concerned  to see a doctor  You know yourself best  Maybe they won't prescribe you anything  I see this concern in your comments   but maybe they will want to start with observation  I had my wife at home w me that first week to make a call in case anything had gotten sideways  Best wishes  Thank you  I will do some research on this  I'm home alone too  This is my first sober NYE in decades  Home is where it's at     Do it occasionally  only when horny  never in front of a screen    Best of luck  Isn't that the truth  If I don't have enough to get me drunk  why bother  My mom always says "just have one shot"  As if   Yeah  I can see one from my front window too   Oh  and helpfully the off duty police are doing traffic duty guiding cars safely in and out of the 3 largest ones I passed on my way home from the movies   I pray everyone makes it home OK  seeing stuff like that just seems real bad to me anymore  We're here for you That sucks   Not sure what to say that would make it better except that your courage in posting that and staying sober should make you realize you are built of sterner stuff than your "friends"   I will not drink with you today  I did this last year  it took till mid march  For me to finally quit   You're not alone  friend    we are all in this together  Sorry this is your year  No matter which dui it is  it's always our last dui  guaranteed   So yeah  take responsibility  You didn't feel horrible and depressed the other times you drank and drove  Try being sorry for the act itself instead of for getting popped  You'll eventually come across to her as a man ready and able to turn over a brand new leaf if he can just be forgiven  Works well once but doesn't work twice  ime   I read below that you intend on trying some AA meetings  About 1 out of 40 new people take their problem seriously enough to begin doing what they absolutely do not want to do  The other 39 are kidding themselves and wasting everyone's time  You'll soon know which group you're in this time around by your actions or inaction     I'm so so sorry for what you're going through  it makes me so sad and you don't deserve this       Not alone  and it's going to be so worth it   Today is day one for me for the same reason  I couldn't justify putting it off any longer  Best wishes to you   I had to google "Skl" and check the meaning lol    Good call  So worth it  Congratulations  that's an awesome decision   It's certainly made me the best version of myself   Welcome  Midnight has passed here and I smoked my last cigarette at 11 50pm  I've quit many times  twice lasting for almost a year before a sneaky joint led me back down the smokey road  This year I'm going all in   no smoking  drinking or weed  Time to focus 100  on my own well being  I'm excited about the fresh start and confident that we can all kick this    Thanks  I'm super proud of myself for where I'm at in life now  I'm sure you know the feeling too    I'll definitely take you up on that offer sometime     Thanks for being awesome   I have been sober since april  however this holiday season has brought with it major stress and anxiety over the smallest things  I can't seem to quiet my mind  I find myself wishing I could escape to drunk land  I'm not drinking with you tonight  I was scared too  I started exercising in the evenings at the time that I usually was drinking  The first few weeks I ate whatever I wanted  whole bag of chocolate  Sure  I'm not drinking  I read this sub ALOT  I also go to one AA mtg a week  rural area  not a lot of meeting options   I read AA literature and other books on sobriety  I'm still learning what works for me  You will read on here alot to focus on one day at a time  That has helped me immensely  I would freak out at the thought of never drinking again or even this month or this week  But just for today  That I can manage thanks for the recommendation    I probably drank 10 20 drinks a day toward the end  What really was bad was the drinking in the morning   sometimes before the sun even came up   Not drinking today   Going to a fundraiser and my friend offered to stay sober with me   Will head to my sober boyfriend's as soon as we get tired of the drunks   That might even be before midnight    One of the symptoms of alcoholism is an inability to predict with certainty that we won't drink more than planned  This happens to you often enough that you are understandably concerned  You are wise to be "wondering" about your relationship with alcohol    What can I say  Eventually  I   could   predict with certainty that if I took one drink I would undoubtedly drink more than planned  i e  too much  Sometimes  like you  I engaged in unfortunate behavior  After many failed efforts to control my alcohol consumption  I finally got professional help and quit drinking altogether  This  happily  put an end to the  embarrassment  guilt  and shame  I now have a happy life without alcohol    It wasn't "acting out" or any kind of psychological self sabotage  I am an alcoholic  Alcoholism is progressive  It starts  often with incidents like you describe  but it always gets worse    If there is any family history of alcohol abuse it puts us at risk for alcoholism  I don't know if this applies to you  I believe I inherited it from my dad's side of the family  Both my father and grandfather were alcoholics    Thanks for your post   I am home as well  Currently watching some Mickey Clubhouse with my 2 year old son by my side  As many times I have seen this annoying episode  it is still paradise compared to being in a regrettable  rude  smelly  drunken  stupor  Awesome job on one year  What a great New Year's Eve resolution last year that is still here this year   Great job  you   Good for you  A healthy year ahead  I'm forever amazed at the sneakiness of my addiction  Oh and the denial  I'm a gold medalist in that sport    After an 18 year relapse  during which I religiously swapping drugs of choice every three to four years  Proving only to myself that I was clearly not an addict  I found my way back in 2012 and it's been a continued shedding of old ideas    It's wonderful to see you have such clarity on New Years   Fist bump and a hearty bear  hug for you my friend    I'm home alone as well  Watching the X Files with my cat  doing laundry    This is my first NYE alone  and sober  in more than 5 years and I don't mind    We're all going to feel like a billion bucks tomorrow  hang over free  "Closed" meeting just means it is for anyone affected by someone else's drinking  Some meetings are held on holidays   The only reason they might cancel is if the building where they meet is closed    Don't geht me wrong or judge me  I know it sounds assaulting but this type of behavior sounds soooooo familiar I can barely resist to comment  Escaping problems beeing unable to accept your mistakes unable to be responsible Take care   It's all about you not her  Change your way of dealing with shit dry not try to influence change her  I am not affiliated to the book or whatever but it sounds so familiar Just read David Deida   was of the s man  It will Change your relatiinshio if you apply the principles   Wow  That's crazy that cops have to direct traffic  I pray everyone is safe tonight too Math  Reading a lot  lot  lot  Talking to friends  Drinking killed all of it  Happy new year  It will feel great waking up sober Chairs   New Year is 3 hours away from where I'm at  but I'm sure I will not remember shit when it comes around Curled up with my pups also  Yep this is going to be me  Unfortunately the holiday season prooved too tempting    Sigh      I really like this  Hope is a powerful thing  Drinking  Congrats  It sounds like you are doing awesome  Constant self improvement is a great track to be on   I'm someone who looks at this sub daily  but also smoke daily so I don't really have the authority to comment and don't usually   But I just wanted to say thanks for telling your story  I identify with a lot of your struggles and understand the reluctance when you don't like the habit  but like yourself so much more when you're engaging in it    I can say that anything you do while stoned is part of your personality anyway  Weed can't make you a different person  it's just about unlocking these things while sober  Trying not to overdo it will almost inevitably lead to smoking more and more over a long period of time  and you getting further away from being able to do these things while sober    Good luck with your journey   I've done that a few times  It's infuriating  I stuck it in right but still somehow fuck that up  Especially super drunk  What looks right to me is the wrong end of a cigarette  That's really shitty  I'm sorry that happened to you   Nice   But I will not take a sip of any alcohol today  and I will be sure to call him bright and early at 8am tomorrow wishing him a happy new year  and hangover     I've learned that nobody can do it  sobriety  for you  I've learned that I can't do anything about other people's drinking  I've learned my decisions regarding alcohol are not going to change anyone else's views or use  And I've learned a bit about resentments  like calling someone at 8 a m  to wish them a happy hangover    This is a very tough time  Stick it out you won't regret it    Honestly if I need a reminder why I don't drink  I stay at a party late and watch  I've noticed for the most part people get real loud and real dumb    Hang in there Its better than the regular vice  Your username is fantastic  Got a pretty good chuckle out of me  I think quitting drinking was the first step in the road to constant improvement  I hope I never stop learning new things   Congratulations on stopping drinking  Now ask yourself what are you going to START  If your whole life revolved around alcohol  mine did  what with all of the drinking people  places  and activities  then you need to get some sober replacements  I found the support  fellowship  and friends I need in AA    No matter what you do  or where you go realize that you have created a huge vacuum  And as you know  vacuums suck  Go forth and fill that hole with recovery   r REDDITORSINRECOVERY is a good start   NOPE  Freshman year in HS  Got so fucked up that I made an awkward video of my friend professing my love to a certain few crushes  puked on myself  and crawled from one end of the hallway back to the room where the alcohol was when I was shirtless and covered in vomit  I wish I could say something comforting  but all I have to say is that I understand and know your pain all too intimately  This illness wreaks havoc on all we hold dear  It's downright cruel  I also think we are stronger than we give ourselves credit for  From one fighter to another  keep fighting   I'm sorry but what does FOMO mean  Been arrested  not due to alcohol  Rather not have that happen again  No one likes to be the laughing stock of a jail cell After the third relapse    Head shave including eye brows   Your story sounds very familiar  I was a big fan of day drinking  I'd buy a half gallon of cheap vodka  spend all day night drinking alone with my headphones on  Doing who knows what once I'd black out  Wake up drunk  keep drinking  and rinse and repeat  I'd tone it down on work days  or just call in sick  I have no desire to go back to that place    Congrats on your sobriety and happy NYE    High Five for 365                Thanks for the honest sharing in this post  Happy New Year  Pace yourself  It can be done  but only when the not drinking challenge lessens  Agreed 100  How to save a life  the fray  The A team  ed sheran So cool  You look a million times happier  Cheers to another fantastic year  Wow sounds fantastic  You should post more here        Did you end up using your gaming PC now  Just with eveyrything uninstalled  Or did you put it somewhere and use a  new  laptop instead  I am sure with a good mindset I could handle my gaming PC    O oh man  that's great   Im soooo happy for and your son   Also  you have amazing cheekbones    Stay sober and some day you may say this is a good thing that happened   There is nothing so bad that drinking won't make it worse    Sending hugs  365 heh  Congratulations  Well done   Totally   I assumed it was some type of DUI check because I was not speeding  so I wasn't nervous at all    I'm hoping my honesty can reach one person  I lied to myself for so long  Being truthful about my disease is what saved me  You have some shit to deal with   Booze won't help any of it   If you can keep the sobriety going things should start going your way   Good luck Hero  Thank you for this post and congratulations on your accomplishments this year  Thank you all one day at a time My 'light' days were a bottle and a half of wine  My 'heavy' days and weekends were 2 bottles plus some shots or a fifth of vodka  Once I nearly finished a handle of fireball on my own  Once I pop I can't stop   I'm always amazed how much clearer and vibrant the eyes are in these type of posts   Congrats on your new life  You've done an amazing thing  I've been checking into the plug dj channel  and I for one  think this is a capitol idea  I have it on both sides  I've always been cautious but within this past year I've noticed I have incidences like I described probably at least four or five times a year   Lurker here  Home  Viceland in the background  Probing random internet rabbit holes  Opening my 3rd bottle of wine  I fucking blow dried a chicken today before cooking  and it was random but magic for crispy skin  Happy New Year  CA  Chairs  I could go days weeks without drinking  but when I finally did I would drink entirely too much   I got myself involved in a few dangerous situations relatively okay   it was then I decided to quit   The straw that broke the camels back was a bachelor party in las vegas that turned into a 4 day bender   Ended up in the ER and staples in my head after slipping on some water at a pool party   It was bad but I feel fortunate  could have been so much worse  Wow  Happy New Year from QLD  Good on you    That's what happened to me  It sneaks up  I didn't stop  though  and one day I woke up with my hands shaking and withdrawal symptoms   This post gives me the warm fuzzies  thank you  I know exactly how you feel and it is awesome  Congratulations and happy  sober new years   Spent all day cleaning for family visiting tomorrow  had a nice early dinner with my wife  gonna plow thought some frozen yogurt  watch a movie and hit the rack before the madness    Its nice not worrying about what might happen if I was gonna go out and get hammered  You're going to like the way you feel tomorrow   I'm not drinking with you  Staying in with my partner and 3 cats  I forgot to get some kind of sparkling water club soda  but should be fun  Good luck to everyone who is staying sober  YES I MADE IT      So much of what you've written rings true for me  you've characterized that feelining of indeterminate loss very well  I keep wondering  "Is it too late to change the course of my life " I feel like I've lost that opportunity somehow  I think for me the loss is a loss of the future  more doors are closed than open  I am still trying to get to the bottom of these mournful feelings of mine  but they both massive and formless  No matter how I cut it  it's going to be difficult to get my arms around it  I shall  however  persevere      You offer so much to this community  Cookietrousers  Thank you   Happy one year Bday btw  Meh  I'm out of town for work  Worked 11 very long hours  I'm currently soaking in a tub  I'm tired and missing my wife but I'm sober  Woohoo on the weigh in for the end of year and crock pot meal for tomorrow  Win win  Happy new year  It is normal to be anxious at only four days  After abusing my body for years  it took awhile for it to find equilibrium  I was tearful  too  and on an emotional roller coaster  That's one of the reasons why I got lots of support from a therapist and AA  It was easier and more fun to be sober with help   Tonight is my last night smoking  I will not enter 2017 lazy and depressed  I have to get off my ass and get my life together  It feels like nothing brings me pleasure anymore  My neurotransmitters are completely shot   Anyone who's quitting tonight tommorow i'm with you  For the sake of everyone here  we ask that you come back tomorrow when sober before you post or comment again  It's against our rules to ask for people to call you  or solicit outside communication   Absolutely   It's the language of empowerment   "Can't" implies victimization or something outside yourself that creates the decision  "Don't want to" owns your choice   HUGE difference   if it keeps happening or you start pooping black tar  please go  Ask for a social worker  and they will help you find a way to pay for your hospital stay and rehab   Also  as far as your family goes  I hid my problem from mine for years  and I understand how you feel now  The thing is either they already know something is up  or it's only a matter of time before something catastrophic happens and they find out  Don't let that stop you from getting what you need to get better  More often than not  if you're trying to get better before you ruin your relationships  they're generally pretty supportive  Chinese food ordered  Seltzer water bubbling  Godzilla movies queued up  Comfy clothes donned  Happy new year   What do you do  I'm in sales  I don't think I can give up the weed  Some people might not understand  but I can honestly say it has saved me from depression and suicidal thoughts  But smoking cigarettes will be something that will not continue  I hope the best to you in the years to come   Same to ya     Netflix and seltzer is a great combo  Send pictures  I'm a private nurse  My client has a ranch and they go there frequently  When they go  I go    Thank you for the encouraging words  I know it will be hurdle I've never attempted to jump over  but ready to punch it in the face and defeat the cravings  That sucks  Sorry for your troubles  Sometimes I have felt like being sober is the best thing I have going for me   Congrats on 5 days  Hang in there  You're braver than I was at four days  Good luck tonight  have fun but stay strong  It hurts to be excluded   You weren't meant to be there is all   Good job being sober   I don't very invited to party and I'm OK with that   I don't enjoy being around heavy drinking anyhow   Have a good new year   Be proud  Yeah that's true  Some people need to drink to have fun or for other reasons  I don't have to anymore  It's like taking training wheels off a bike  It's really great  I take lots of my own seltzer water with me to parties these days   Enjoy the party sober  I've come to prefer it  At least you should have gotten some good mileage on your eggs   I'm assuming you play Pokemon Go from the Charmander in your picture    Indeed   As I said  devilish thought   My apologies and will delete  Indeed   As I said  devilish thought   My apologies and will delete  Well isn't that interesting  How did you end up doing that  That book and this sub have played a major role in my sobriety  Congrats on making the change  These sorts of posts aren't really appropriate on stopdrinking for a few reasons  One  these posts tend to turn into one up contests  where people will eventually try and top each other in terms of how bad  or what sort of depraved stuff they've done  It's not about comparing bottoms   Two  someone who may be thinking they need to re evaluate their own issues will see these posts and then compare themselves to some of the stuff here  and think 'well ive never shit myself in the middle of a Denny's so i might not have a problem'  and then continue to drink and let things get worse   These types of posts can actually  lengthen  the amount of time someone lurking spends drinking  because they think they're not as bad as X or Y yet  And it doesn't have to be rock bottom for someone to get support for quitting drinking  Happy new year  I will not drink with you  The "242" days  D Thank you for the comment  I don't know a lot of people who have my experience of weed  Most people I know just experience the couch lock and the giggles  They can barely think  let alone work  write and be productive  I don't like getting high with other people so much  They are always easier to smoke another one when I'm really done for the day   Welcome  Thanks sunny qld  Happy new year to you too    congrat's on 48 days    Awesome  You look great  Thank you for sharing your story   Just the kind of thing it's great to hear as the new year rolls in  Have you ever considered doing ERP   I hope you feel better  Also don't worry about missing the holiday  holidays are bullshit  50 50 I'd be done for the day already by now if I had had a drink  We're going to re start Game of Thrones back at the beginning tonight  See a therapist skilled in CBT and consider doing ERP to manage and reduce your compulsive behaviour  This is the only accomplishment I've ever had in life Sorry to hear  I imagine it is hard to be away  We were thinking of going to a big charity event this evening   150 per person for a big surf and turf buffet with open bar  But I realized I don't want to be around a bunch of drunk people at midnight  not to mention having to drive home afterwards with the fear of encountering a drunk driver on the way  So we are staying home and will probably go to bed early   Hopefully you find success in quitting I will not drink with you today  Drink that quart and another and take the day off tomorrow if you can  Happy new year fucker i'm there with you  with the whole about to go to bed thing  didn't mean to come off creepy   seriously debating going on a run tomorrow morning and proposing to the first qt3 14 i see on the trail as someone who i know for a fact doesn't drink  or at least doesn't drink enough to get hungover on the day of days to have a hangover   Not on this sub      Good advice   Here's to an awesome 2017  Can I call you  Hang in there  I am truly sorry  Thank you for your courageous service under these sad circumstances  Stay in touch   I'm going to eat ramen and then off to a movie   Going with a normie friend who doesn't drink   I considered staying in entirely  but I thought doing something that didn't involve alcohol might be better   Thanks everyone for being here  Thanks fappin  you're beautiful   I'm with you on the "1st day of the year" thing  But dont make more excuses to watch even more porn fap  These are the good old days  Holy shit  you're still here and almost have a full year   I remember seeing your early days stories when you first got sober  you posted some before after pictures   Anyway  that's so awesome to see you still here and still sober  Tell us about your uncle if you like   Thanks for the kind words and support  Handle  Hope you're feeling better today  Out with the old  in with the new  Thank you  Thank you  My hope is dwindling  Maybe four  five hospitalizations ago I believed "It'll get better  " but now that almost seems cruel   How much longer can I go on with it screaming in my head  even overanalyzing a hug  shrinking away like it burns even though it's what I want MORE THAN ANYTHING  How many more passing of the seasons will be marked with what the purged Oreo colors  Halloween orange  Christmas red  look like  Will my electrolytes ever not have to be dialed in  Will a non purged meal ever not seem like a flag brandishing victory  How much longer can I take feeling both six and ninety six  but RARELY 26  at the same time  How can I GRIEVE all this  I won't drink with you  Starting the new year sober and cleaning my home as a symbolic gesture of a clean life and beginning  Welcome  we all have the same motivation  to be guilt free and in control again   you got this   Try this quiz   http   www aa org pages en US is aa for you twelve questions only you can answer  It's anonymous  so answer honestly  It should help clarify your thinking about your drinking  Happy New York  Feel better soon  Well  at least you are sober  Congrats  This is not alcohol or drug addiction in the external sense   This is something different from that   Folks that don't go through it won't understand   I hate to say it  but this is likely the first of many instances where it seems like the cravings just get stronger   Perhaps the cravings never cease in their intensity  but your willpower strengthens  and your ability to see that you're better off without    I really appreciate your response  I feel destroyed by this monster that alternates between binge purging and starving  gnawing at me from the inside  It's so ugly and lonely  Lol  nah  I tried playing it when it first came out but it's not much fun in the suburbs unfortunately    Google Fit says I'm more active than 81  of my town though  and I don't even carry my phone at work usually  where I am active almost 100  of the time   So I've got that going for me I guess   Oh wow  Powerful post and right where I am now except it's 6 46pm  The imposter syndrome runs strong in us addicts and that's what I have to remind myself all the time   The statistic that I commonly use in groups is that  on average  a person in recovery relapses seven times   That's not permission to relapse seven times  nor does it mean everyone relapses seven times  some will relapse more times than that  some less  and some never    The purpose of this is to illustrate that relapse happens   In a perfect world it wouldn't  but this is a far from perfect world   The best we can do is try to understand what heightens our own risks for relapse and work to lower those risks for ourselves And we just polished off our HD pint  Happy

questions or concerns   I need to know how blow drying a chicken makes crispy skin a little over three weeks here  I had some anxiety spikes and was worried I'd have nightmares  but so far every dream I've had has been so vivid and wonderful  and it's as if they're all trying to tell me something  and I find much joy and wisdom in picking them apart  Don't worry about it too much  I drank that much if not more and had no serious withdrawals  There were some effects for a few weeks  but nothing that made me even consider seeing a doctor  At worst I had some serious brain fog but that lifted after a couple weeks  Granted everyone is different and I'm no doctor  which if you have any doubts you should see one  It's part of their job to be discreet and honestly they don't give a flying fuck if you're an alcoholic trying to quit  they're just there to help you be healthy    Forget about the drawbacks  let's talk about some of the good things  When was the last time you had real  honest to god sober sleep  For me it had probably been over a decade  Then about 2 weeks sober  around the time  the brain fog lifted  I started sleeping like a baby  Waking up from that sleep was the most satisfying feeling ever  better than any night of drunk partying or one night stands  Then I stopped getting heartburn every day  My stomach started to even out and I could take real poops again  Then there was the weight loss and on and on and on  I know making the choice to quit drinking is scary  but don't let it stop you from getting sober by getting hung up on the bad stuff and start thinking about all of the good that can come from it  Seriously  take some time to write down the pros and cons of sobriety and then the pros and cons of drinking  See how they stack up  Here's what's even better  I'm still discovering new pros for sobriety all the time  things I never even thought of while I was drinking  All I can remember discovering while I was drinking was reasons to quit   Best of luck to you my friend and Happy New Year   WD's yesterday which was shit  shaky as fuck  Pretty good today though  so on the sauce for NYE before sorting out tapering  if anyone's around I'll be there for some time   Cheers Wish I would have read this before dinner   The place did " reasonably authentic Chinese" and was phenomenal   But I got two Asian soft drinks that just didn't work for me   They did have tea there   Shoulda gone that route  Oh my gosh I have this also  My boyfriend is very good in bed so I enjoy that  but some days I just want to cry when he asks me to get naked for him and other days I feel somewhat comfortable   He wants me to do a strip tease for him all the time but there's no way I feel sexy enough to do that  The only way I've dealt with it is by refusing to do anything at times because I feel so uncomfortable  I'm sorry I can't be much help but you're not alone     New Year's Eve  I will complete day 59 sober  No drinking for me tonight  FTZ  Video games I've been a nurse for 18 years  Most of that was working with acutely ill patients  A lot of ventilated patients in long term care  Tragic stuff  really   One day the supply manager mentioned that a friend of hers was an executive secretary for a lady with a sick spouse and looking for a private nurse   That was four years ago  It's definitely been and  interesting  ride  Congratulations  Let's all stay on this sober path together in 2017  Happy NY  If you have my number  go for it   Thank you   I have a lot of hobbies that drinking has interfered with like cycling  mountain biking  long distance running  working out  reading etc  I plan to use those to remind myself what I want to do    After my sober 2 months break I realized that I was social and could come out of my shell if I wanted to w o alcohol    A lot of my friends are seeing they are pretty heavy drinkers  I think a good portion of them  or at least some  will naturally slow down as we enter our 30s and I can have meaningful non drinking events with them   Thank you and happy new years  Despite being surrounded by booze  I will also not drink with you tonight  What an awesome story   You look gorgeous  Well done   I will not drink with you tonight   This is a great thing you're doing  Thanks for the support  Just make sure you don't drink the beer you ashed in  that's the leading cause of Space Aids  Stick up for yourself  It's okay to be selfish about staying sober  remember that  I don't pass up opportunities to suggest this book  I bought an extra copy just to give to someone at some time  Thank you  Thanks  I hope so too  OMG  Yes call me please  Yeah  The small things are getting so enjoyable already  I had a terrible sleep last night too    tossing and turning with no comfort  hot with the blanket on  cold with the blanket off  Wake up and think I haven't been sleeping at all  Yet  I still have more energy today than I normally do when I wake n bake  Thanks for the encouragement  Hey Daisy  I read your post and had to reply right away  First  congrats on the life choice  And I do mean LIFE choice  At this precise moment on new years eve  I sit in bed with my partner lying next to me asleep  Or at least what used to be her  3 years ago when she came back into my life after being absent for like 3 years  she had become a heavy drinker  For 3 years I watched her drink a bottle of Vodka a day  waiting for her to decide to stop  4 months ago  after being hospitalized for 5 days because she couldn't keep any food down and had bloody diareah she was admitted for acute liver failure  pancreatitis  malnutrition  low potassium  and a number of other things  in spite of the doc telling her it would kill her if she drank again  she went home and drank anyway  Only now she switched to wine figuring it wouldn't be as bad as Vodka  That lasted about a week  And then she just stopped  10 days after she stopped   she was still throwing up and unable to eat  But what really concerned me was she was starting to be confused about things  Swearing she had seen and talked to people she had not for example  I started doing some research   Skip to now  Google Wernickes   Korsakoff Syndrome  Because of the way is presents it was not caught right away and because her doctor was a douche it also wasn't treated properly  Now my partner is 36 years old and will have permanent brain damage for the rest of her life  From heavy drinking    Based on what you have said  I strongly suggest that you seek medical assistance with your decision to quit  Detoxing is tremendously painful with alcohol and if you are alone you could have a heart attack or something with no one around  If you don't see a doc then at least recruit a friend  Good luck  You just may have a lot of "stored up" tears then   I have no desire to drink at all tonight  I am exhausted from working all week and today  I only wish I could crawl into bed now but I have 2 hours before I have to pick my daughter up from a party    I'm going to eat cereal and watch crappy movies with my bf til then    I will not drink with you today  Happy new years  Thanks for the support  Stick figures are welcome    My first check in  2017 will be amazing Same to you friend    I'm at home in my easy chair after dinner and maybe about to watch some TV but midnight is 3 hours away and I may need a nap to get there  Stay strong and play the tape through  It won't end with that buzz    Enjoy remembering a fantastic night  I still have yet to watch any GoT  Is it on Netflix  I was thinking about starting The Walking Dead  I think we always watched it on HBO  But I think you can get HBO Go without HBO  Welcome   I used to have the 'post blackout' ritual also   I really  really don't miss that  Take it easy  Congrats on 145  It definitely has with me  at least the anxiety   I'm really sorry   I can see why you're upset about this  I would be  too   Sending you all the internet hugs you can handle  Good job staying strong so far  Keep it up     a million internet hugs and virtual La Croix for you   Hang in there   3 I'm so sorry you are suffering  Kudos to you for not picking up a drink and making the suffering worse   the growing alarm that time was running out  and something bad would happen soon  This was it for me too  Was not a matter of IF  but when  I knew I had to stop drinking    Great share  Thank you  And the eyes definitely have it  Keep working it  Let's crush 2017  I'm not drinking with you tonight  too  Happy new year 18 years  Wow  I'm glad to say that makes me feel a lot better about myself    Yeah  Here's to a productive and successful 2017  Thanks for teaching me humility and some tough lessons 2016    Bear hugs are best when performed heartily   I will not drink for the next 7 hours until I go to bed   It is so hard right now   ERP  What's that   Yup   Some people I know could've had a buzz  then stopped and even sobered up   Not me   That blurring feeling would've ended up with me blacked out and obnoxious  "You're the one choosing not to drink  other people can't make that decision for you "  Exactly  Well said  Thank you for the inspiration  Congratulations on 2 years  Look at you  so productive  That is a good feeling  Joining you in a sober NYE   You  too  Thank you for the reminder and well wishes  Thankfully  I won't be on the roads at all  Just getting my butt kicked board gaming with my partner     Just let it roll off you  What point is there to fretting and arguing with him about it  Either his intentions were good  in which case you should take it as intended  or his intentions were bad  in which case he's not a friend  There's no option but to let it pass by without another thought or worry   I'm about nine days in  I quit drinking beer   That's all it took for me   Happy New Years everyone  Happy new year to you as well  Thank you  Thank you  also for sharing this    I don't know and I don't care anymore  It'll be 2017  I won't bring that baggage into the new year  Awesome  Thanks for sharing  Do you have a history of doing stupid obnoxious drunk stuff around your friend or friends  Agressive  inappropriate  embarrassing  cringe worthy  etc   I have an alcoholic friend and for years he routinely made life difficult at social gatherings  Some people just don't want to deal with that  It sucks  but if that is the case  it's not fair to blame your buddy  It's on you  Good luck  Sorry you're hurt   Good luck  Check in all you want and need to  Good job on being strong  Keep it up   3 You know how to make the two handle trek a little bit lighter  Put majority of one handle in your stomach   Cheers fucker  I know how shitty the jaunt is with heavy booze  just  hope youre not like me and have to do it in the MN winter   Thanks  Congrats on 105    How have you stayed sober 37 days   That's a big deal  Funny how booze can choose people that are keep us from being the better version of ourselves  What's that they say about good intentions    Would recommend to ignore that 2017 nosense new year thing   Dont hang on some dates that sound nice to stop   If u do  u might be in trouble  Playing basketball  I try  thank you for your internet stranger  Yes  Alone  sad and fighting urges to watch porn here too  Let's help each other  We can win this fight  Thank you  So am I    Maybe if you saw yourself drink on video you would gasp  I've got an good alcoholic friend and he is universally regarded by a wide range of friends  associates  and aquaintances as a liability at social gatherings  He isn't shunned  but he isn't invited to some things because of how he can become  You might want to consider the effects you have on other people can really be quite distressing  You sound dismissive of your behavior  I speak from a place of experience  I'm not sure you've accepted the depths of what being an alcoholic can mean for the relationships in your life   Food for thought  I understand your hurt but it might be temporary  Work on yourself and the rest of your life will fall into place  If you stop drinking   Drinking does to some people  Just not me   We're all in this together    I'm trying to make it last me awhile since places will be closed and I'm broke anyway  unfortunately    So no chugging it    This time last year I went all summer pick free  dec  jan and feb  but then uni started again and the stress piled up    you know where this goes    I was so proud of myself but at least I know it's possible Thank you for sharing this  I am relatively new  and I have been trying to practice meditation  too  Kabat Zinn style   I am not crying during meditation  although I agree with everyone one here that it would be okay  Also  I think Kabat Zinn would say that the most important thing is that you are trying it and being consistent  I try to concentrate on my breath and a slogan  or just my HP    I have a surpluss of emotions right now  too  so I identify with what you wrote  I have many tears I haven't shed  but I feel safe enough in meetings that I usually just get a lot of it out then  Are you going to meetings  The wonderful ladies in my Monday meeting are so accepting of my tears and are so loving about it  And through it all  they assure me that I  will  feel better  which is so encouraging to me right now   Thank you and     hugs     for your post  OP  and all who responded to it  That stinks  Feel better   I'll definitely look into that  One trick I used to do is take Benadryl while drinking  It helped sleep  but also seemed to amplify the alcohol effects    Its not quite sustainable cuz tolerance  And it makes you feel even more dehydrated than usual    Wont places be open again on monday   Yeah I should probably go to a psychiatrist   The idea of getting prescribed opiates scares me shitless  And according to autocorrect  shirtless      It really just depends on the meeting  Meetings in my area  SoCal  usually take a group conscience and then just inform our local office in case someone calls to see if it will be there or not  I hope you found one  I am looking forward to mine tomorrow  If one ex smoker can hold out around many people smoking then they have my admiration and respect  Secretly every smoker knows they shouldn't smoke  and I believe anyone would be equally as impressed as I would be  What I'm getting at is your family dig you for being a non smoker  Bathe in their unspoken admiration  absorb their unquantified respect and let it propel you to be that dam non smoker you deserve to be   Every single person on this sub has relapsed  Most have broken streaks longer than that  We're all still here every day  just trying to make it through the day in front of us   You can get back up  Go help someone else  and you'll feel stronger too  Thank you for your service  I'm sorry your people did that to you but you are better than that  We are all here if you need something   I ended up dumping mine too   Don't even want it around  Happy New Year   This is actually a big issue with this expansion  particularly with the way she was playing it  for the gold   this expansion has reintroduced the grind to WoW in a way it has never existed before  unending  Even the very top players in WoW haven't managed to come anywhere close to 'completion' to a point where you can say 'no reason to log on outside of content hours'  and they are getting ready to release MORE  It is actually killing a lot of the game too because its burning people out so fast  the content is fun to an extent but it is life absorbing for any people who plan to try and stay competitive  I'm struggling today  This is a hard night for all of us  and I'm so grateful to have this community to find solace in  Thank you all  I won't drink with you tonight  Wow  that can be tough  My suggestion would be to break the habit of going out with them when they take a smoke break  If they smoke in the house  you may want to avoid their houses for a while   Glad you checked in  and if you're bored and looking to pass time tonight  come join us in the chat  Understood  But even if you accidentally picked up sparkling wine  in my mind  if you stopped drinking it when you realized it  it's not a relapse   That said  I hope you enjoyed your NA sparking cider    Have a great new year  And you   I have an insane tolerance to benadryl  I was thinking earlier I wish I had picked some up anyway but too late now  Oh well    And idk  The liquor laws in SC are much different than in KS and MO  I don't know them yet   I did   Like   why tempt myself  Done  Thanks   I might do just that  Awesome  congrats on a year  I'm not sure of any bucket list things I'll knock out in 2017  but I'm pretty psyched to spend it sober   I've said this before but because you went a month  that means you can  and will  do it again   The key  to restraint for you seems to be not getting too close to the mirror  I think even when we with compulsive skin picking disorder leave our skin alone and get it clear   or at least don't make things worse by messing with it  we are still obsessed with our skin   Then if we don't pick we focus obsessively on the perfect makeup   the perfect skincare   So we are still  obsessed with our skin  but for me from my personal experience  the focus on skin care and makeup leads me back to the mirror which leads to disaster and lapses for me    Because that cycle happened to me repeatedly  I began to think back to the time in my life when I never looked in the mirror   when I was a child   So I thought nothing else has worked  I'll do what I did as a child   just really not bother with it or even think about it   Wash it without looking at it   Lotion cream if skin is dry   put on with cotton ball or washcloth   A  good coverage powder from a distance  lipstick   arrange hair   all from a foot or more from a mirror   Done   Free from thinking about my skin  Don't know if this helps to know but it works for me   Besides I got so damn tired of thinking of  touching constantly  "fixing" my skin and making it worse and worse myself   I figured if I totally ignored my skin  it would probably look a thousand times better than when I was focusing obsessively on my skin and  "perfecting"  make that ruining  it   It certainly couldn't look any worse than I was making it and plus I would gain back the hours of my life I sacrificed to picking   It turned out to be the right choice for me    We had a young man share at a my home group this week  It was like the words hurt him as he said things out loud that he'd never said to anyone before    It took  not only me  but a bunch of us right back to early days of sobriety  A powerful reminder of how far I have come in recovery    I go to meetings to remember  I work with newcomers and service  Service has kept me sober in times when meetings alone might not have been enough   Great choice  I did the same  It feels good  I know I will wake up feeling good and actually enjoy my coffee  Your life is the party when you are up and ready for the day  each and every day  The "partiers" are convalescing from the previous night  i went out a few weeks ago like that and   it's nice to do every now and again to air myself out but people get silly when they drink and it kinda bores me  i went out through meetup com and a few people definitely made the comment that i wasn't drinking  on a pub crawl of all things  oh well  not that i care i am sober and that's all there is to it  i have replaced a lot of that emptiness with running  maybe i will get back into climbing as a scene   i dunno  but the bar club scene is getting kinda old now  any sort of social activity is kinda lubricated with alcohol  art shows  food truck festivals  festivals in general   it's just silly really  drinking is silly and i would rather not be doing such silly things   We definitely care    Sobriety will get you so much further than drinking  especially when life is hard  Minutes by minute  day by day  life will get better   Awesome  I'm really happy that you posted that  thank you  You have perfectly described what I've been feeling myself  I'm sure we all share the same fear of not feeling comfortable with ourselves      I don't get to use booze to mask how I'm feeling  and that goes for the gloomy feelings as well as the good stuff   I agree with you  but the way I think of it is we are choosing to live life without self medicating  We are choosing the hard way  Every morning we wake up and look in the mirror we must remind ourselves that we are making ourselves stronger everyday    The best thing I can do for myself is to exercise and eat well  Do it long enough and you feel unstoppable  Overtime you will feel better and better and feel comfortable exploring new things in life    As for me  I'm still working on feeling comfortable  I turned down a NYE party because of disabling anxiety and worry  But hey  gym in the morning and no work on Monday  So I'll be sure to find something fun to do   you are very gracious and generous  Happy New Year to you   I care   That sucks   As has been said more than once  "there's no situation so bad alcohol won't make it worse"   Sorry that happened to you  Exactly what I'm doing     starting off 2017 fresh and excited for the day  Last year at this time all I wanted to do was get fucked up but now I am so much more engaged in life that I want to go to bed early so I can experience more during the day  https   kiwiirc com client irc snoonet org stopdrinking  Maybe  r legaladvice and r alanon can help too  What a tough spot for your family   Way to go  I completely agree  I always felt so disgusted with myself  I didn't have motivation to really do anything else besides vape and watch Netflix  Luckily I'm 2 weeks without smoking tomorrow  So fucking happy   I was going to say "anything"  but Swedish pancakes with lignonberry sauce are better than anything  It's my third sober NYE  and I want to salute  and send good wishes to all the sobernauts here on SD  We have a lot to celebrate  not the least of which is that we're ringing in the New Year as the masters of our fates  and the captains of our souls  Godspeed  everyone  I still feel like my friends don't want to be around me  It's multiple different groups too  And when I think about it I get really upset because deep down I can't help but blame myself for the isolating  I kind of decided recently that I would just work on myself and not be sad about the fact that they are all still friends and they all make plans and have trips and dinners and party's and game nights and no one even texts me to ask how I'm doing  I always text first which is fine but if I try to talk about getting lunch or make plans they say ok and as it gets close they end up blowing me off  Hurts and I realize I'm not doing something right  Then I'm upset bc I might make someone else feel this way and then I just want to be alone  Or hang out with my mom which I don't really think is totally normal for someone my age  Even my friends who have close families they all have really large groups of friends   Whats the cop going to do   "Sir  have you been drinking tonight "   flashes  r stopdrinking badge  No party invites for me either       Happy new year to you      I wish you peace  prosperity snd a giant side of happiness    Sounds like a great day  I plan to hike to a lighthouse in the morning  That would never happen if I was drinking     That I would wake up from a blackout with consequences I could never fix        Spoken for truth  I've had an odd time these last few weeks while the world agonizes the terrible year of '16 and all the greats who have been lost and in the back of my mind  I'm like "this is the first calendar year and overall  longest  I've been alcohol free in couple decades " Personally 2016 has been a real milestone of zero regrets         Hearty congrats JungFuPDX and I wish you a very happy 2017  I'm curious  what made you quit 2 weeks ago  Digitalism is the soundtrack to this night for me Crossposting is OK  but the OP should say that they crossposted   Otherwise we can end up with duplicate suggestions in the discussions  wasting commenters' time   The ideal is to make one text post  in one sub Reddit  and one link post  in another sub Reddit  which points to the original text post   Makes sense   P S   I see you're fairly new to Reddit   Welcome   Please do turn email comment reply notifications on in your Preferences screen  That's a good idea  I plan to go to homegroup in the morning and then maybe take my dogs out in the afternoon for a hike  Thanks for the good idea   I miss being drunk   but nothing else that goes along with it  Focusing on the absence of the negative instead of the absence of the positive  fun while being drunk  has helped me immensely  Then time passes and it's crazy how much better I feel in general  Oddly enough  ingesting a depressant in large quantities daily makes you   depressed  I feel much better  I'd give it some time   hopefully you will too   Great post   Thank you    Right there with you my friend  I remember thinking the same thing to myself last year  didn't follow through  and wasted away another year getting stoned  Not again    Currently on Day 3  and i'm feeling extremely motivated to keep it up  Good luck to you sir  and happy new year  Please sign me up Hey great job on the 5K   It sounds like a better day night than most anyone else will have   Congratulations on staying sober  Happy TWO years    Please sign me up I used to love drawing  I hadn't drawn in years  Two days ago I went to the art store and got some basic supplies  I drew a few random things and it was so relaxing  I cant wait to do it more  That's no fun   Your city's intergroup hotline is probably answered by volunteers  and maybe you got one who wasn't so nice   You want to look at your city's printable PDF meeting list and find a group which runs an open speaker meeting once a month   May I ask what city you live in  I'm also struggling with Overwatch  it's a game that can be so fun yet so toxic at the same time  I hope that we can both learn how to control our urges to play Overwatch  Best of luck   D I don't understand rock bottom  If you are alive you can always change things  but that's the hard part  For me rock bottom will be the end  no coming back from   Pop by and play some  I'm playing rock right now  but am open    hope you feel better soon x I'm in the St  Louis area  let me know if you find anything  thanks  At least Congratulations on 365 days   Way to go   Good luck to you too  Congrats on 365 days    Beautiful  You are stunning and congrats on your year   Made the decision today too  I gotta get back to reality and not get high to cover up feelings or bad things going on  Everything feels like a chore when im not high and im just ready to stop  Im in there with you man  we got this  Happy new years eve   I'm so excited to start 2017 sober and see how this year pans out   and ACTUALLY REMEBER things that happen    Cheers ing you all with some sparkling juice   Go join your friends  Just don't smoke   That's very empowering      "When someone shows you who they are  believe them the first time "   Maya Angelou       I think 2017 will be your year   It's different for each person  I've gotten clean cold turkey  with suboxxone and now I'm on methadone  CT wasn't as bad the first time bc I was still smoking H and hadn't started shooting an astronomical amount but when I tried it the second time I relapsed I could personally tell it wouldn't work for me  Then I tried subs and got clean again  I only took them for a month so I weaned down quickly  and stayed sober for a bit  The last time I relapsed I tried subs again and they made me feel weird  like my mind and body weren't connected  It took forever to process thoughts and put together sentences and I always felt a little sick no matter how much I upped the dose so I went to methadone  I personally like methadone bc I have a free counselor I can talk to  it's inexpensive plus they have a free program for people who can't afford it and it gives you a sense of routine and discipline   She's probably going to have to do trial and error but I would have a couple subs handy if possible but try cold turkey first  That way if it gets to be too much she can see how she likes the subs   You've made it to the year 2017 OP  I'm proud of you  hang in there man  Thank you   One of the things that brought me here was the fact I was being shunned socially   I was embarrassing to be around in situations involving alcohol   These days I realize I am an introvert and the only thing that brought me to events was the drinking   Which is why I am content sending this from my bed on New Years  I don't think it is extreme  your house  your rules   I don't allow alcohol in my house  they can have it on the back porch  but not inside   Me either     I thank God I got antidepressants that helped me   And i am so glad they are helping you  too   People who have not experienced major long term depression have no comprehension of how painful it is   Here's hoping we keep it in our rear view mirrors  What a wonderful thing to do   I would love to get one December 2017  Another thing to look forward to    Stepping away from a NYE party  low key  family variety  for some inspiration and found it here   Thanks  I know  I have the same concept for accidental drinking  but it's still something I'd really like to avoid   Hope you have a good new year's too  Congratulations  that's awesome  It gets better  Trust me I've heard great things about running from tons of people who were able to "replace" bad habits with it   Thank you so much  Reading kind words about put me in tears right now  I have no interest in drinking and though things are bad  I know they're at least better with sobriety   Thank you  If I can make it through tonight  maybe I can make it through anything   It's good that you're deciding to quit since  as you said  porn adds nothing to life  I wouldn't tell anyone in real life unless it becomes a huge issue and is super hard to quit mainly because it's embarrassing and a lot of people think porn is natural and ok  Try going to the gym or picking up reading or meditating if you're looking for substitutes to stave off boredom  All three of those are great for rewiring your brain as well  Good luck  They usually recommend 12 24 hours but I would wait 24 hours to be completely safe Thank you very much  Congratulations on 18 days  They're the toughest  and you never have to do them again     "the internet"   finally allowing introverts and extroverts to socialize together    That sucks  I'm sorry   I didn't want to be that guy for my son   You've made a great choice   I won't drink with you today  How is the party  OP  Enjoying yourself while still staying strong   Thank you so freaking much  I'm going to attend but I've been to a couple parties and bars and turned down every drink  It's amazing how much that badge really makes a difference and helps keep me accountable    I'll probably be that awkward guy in the corner  But I hurt way too much right now to stay home alone with my thoughts  I really hate myself for letting someone else determine my self worth    Thank you for caring   never  wow you must have been lucky with your travels  last time i went anywhere  my friends had gotten immodium and prescription versions that were stronger just in case I hope that didn't come off as whiny   It is what it is   I'm just glad I quit    This is amazing  Congratulations    Also  I LOVE your hair color in the last photo  Very flattering on you     This is what I did  I just stopped a few days ago because I decided I wouldnt use stopping after New Years as an excuse  If I was gonna do it I was gonna do it right now  No excuses and no waiting  And tonight I'm sober and staying that way and couldn't be happier   Ze lingonberry pancakes  Damn  how did you get arrested   It didn't  trust me   It came off as you being frustrated  which you have every right to be  I'm so sorry  I can relate  28 years old  enough near death experiences and hospitalizations and medical complications to convince me I can't possibly only be a third of the way through a typical lifespan  there's no way I'm going to make it another 50  years  Please know that you don't deserve any of this   3 Take care  I'm so glad I found this community a couple of days ago  This night is the only night every year when I get the most unbearable anxiety and FOMO   I always put such pressure on myself to ring in the new year in an exciting way  I know that this night is just another night and that it really doesn't matter if I go out  but I find it so difficult to just calm down and treat it as a normal evening    That being said  I am doing my best to stay calm this year  I'm staying in with my partner  playing games and watching videos online  It's just another night  and not an excuse to drink   Wishing you all a safe and happy night tonight and a 2017 full of only the best life has to offer  Take care of yourselves  Thank you I know coke used to help me with withdrawal so I would imagine E would help as well  I'd have some xanax or something ready for the comedown though or it will be 10X worse Yeah  i'm starting to think my friends either don't like me or the only thing we had in common was drinking   It is good you see this as the reminder it is  Thanks for posting  It helps me be reminded to stay sober for my son  Good for you  Happy new year  Dude if you have Hulu or if you like to torrent stuff  check out the show Review  It is from Comedy Central  It's one of the funniest shows I've ever seen and the first episode even does a segment on addiction that's fucking hilarious  Man I would while I'm getting ready to head out but all I have is android  Can you do it on a Ps4 that you know of   damn your story and experience sound a like mine  taking itevery 2 3 hours is a nightmare  especially for sleep  i always feel like i'm in withdrawal  hope ya recover  In AA parlance this problem is called "the physical allergy" where the drinker is "powerless" over alcohol    The other factor is "the mental obsession"  where the drinker cannot obstain and continuously returns to drinking  Well done  You have had a busy 18 months    So glad I'm staying home and waking up without a hangover   It's great to hear that NYE 2016 will be a safe and sober night for you  No reason to worry about getting run over or incurring the wrath of a pregnant woman tonight  Enjoy it   Congratulations on your 36 so far   Let me clarify   I was never a depressive drunk  I was always happy  But the following shame spiral and depressant in my system was not helpful for me   Lost my aunt in 2011  Her loss is still felt today  I will not drink as well  Yes  please share more if you'd like  There is only about another 55 minutes left today  but I did not drink and I certainly will not be doing so at this point   I just didn't want to miss out on my check in for today  Happy NYE and 2017 to you all  Alas  I think it is web only  Outside of navigating a ps4 webapp to the right address idk I relate on a lot of these issues  from wanting more than drinking buddy relationships to the post drinking status check  Unfortunately a few nights ago there were some drunken texts  harmless  but embarrassing    I spent the next day in an anxious haze and have found that when I drink lately  crippling anxiety goes along with my hangovers  Not because of anything that happened  although that makes it worse  but because the booze takes such a toll on my body    Anyway  congrats on recognizing that you'd like things to change  we deserve it   From what I can see here in SD there are a lot of people that can relate  it's nice to feel a little less alone  "If I drink I'm out on my ass "   Sounds like a pretty good reason to stay sober  I love black beans btw  Usually with rice and chicken though  My wife is cutting back for 2017   time for me to try again  I started 2016 sober and lasted for 2 5 months  I know with less poison around the house I'll make this stick and am looking forward to a sober LIFE ringing in the New Year  Thank you all here at SD  A few more days and the clouds are going to start breaking and you are going to feel so good    hang in there Ups and downs tonight  but the downs are good  Lots of introspection and gratitude  Staying in tonight   I could probably pull off a sober hour or two out somewhere  but I've done the NYE parties  done the good time friends  done the hangovers and regrets and reruns of the same  I don't know where I go from here or even who I am sometimes because I've spent a great deal of the last 5 years numbing myself most nights   wishing the previous 5 years had turned out differently  What a waste of time it has been  So grateful to be here now  sober and awake   Me too  I took 2 months of drinking   went on vacation drank a bunch as I planned  Then came back and planned to moderate    two weekly later and after a 20 drink night two days ago I decided I simply can't do it  Here I am  Did you drink last new years and then decide Jan 1st to quit  Where I am it isn't new years yet  Just curious   There are sober people in Australia  Right on man  I did not even start to thing about that    cheers on the new year and lotsa water    I really hope it gets better because right now  I'm in hell not only that but sex drive in general and even performance has gone to hell   I embarassed myself terribly with a beautiful woman a few nights ago and i swear its because it was day 12 and my libido is shot    Its turning into the final obstacle for me  I really want to have just a puff or two with sex  but as you know that just keeps it in my life  I'm so happy for you  We made it  The good work continues    I'm in  How long have you quit for  if you don't mind me asking Thank you  I've been trying for ages with nofap  not got further than about 20 days  Finally managed to get over the magic month so it's quite disappointing this happened  I definitely felt more positive while I was abstaining so I want to keep it going   Let's go  Wow  Thank you for sharing  Congratulations on making it one year sober  I'm sure this wasn't easy for you  so take a moment to pat yourself on the back   Wishing you an amazing 2017   I hear you  for me weed is the ultimate scapegoat for all my failures in life   If I stop smoking I'll have to take responsibility myself and not just say someday when i stop smoking    To be honest dude in early sobriety you might get left out of a lot of things    I flip flop between sober and not sober a bit because I constantly fuck up   But I've found it nice to have two circles of friends  It's hard at first  but it helps me    My friends wanna go party and I wanna do something too  I'll hit up my sober pal and we'll watch movies and knit like some motherfuckers  Or I'll hit up someone I've been talking to and see if they want to go on a date  Or just see what my friends I know aren't drinking are up to    It sucks having two separate circles but I can't really let my old buddies go even if they still like to get fucked up  I love em and all that jazz  And I know they're worried about me and sometimes don't want to invite me to some of the more hard throw downs    And I'm coming to really like my sober pals a lot too   Almost as much as I used to like partying and that is saying something    I dunno man  maybe try something like I did   Skating  my family  video editing  making music    But all that shit has been gone for years  I'm basically having to find all new stuff to like   I was a kid in my mid teens then  now I'm in my late 20s  Time for new hobbies anyway  I shouldn't try holding onto the shit I had before  I think My former poisons of choice as well  To me now  Wine doesn't taste as good as sobriety feels  Happy NY  My thoughts are that breaking down and smoking would only add to any holiday depression  not help it You're GORGEOUS  Proud of you too     Your empathy means so much  So often in groups  treatment centers  etc   the other patients are younger or so much "newer" to the system and I feel guilty  a bitter  jaded  cynical  damaged piece of goods  When I'm supposed to be feeling like the world is full of possiblity  y'know  we're in our LATE TWENTIES  man   I'm there in CVS waiting in line for my prescription potassium   Augmenting the pain  to so many people I am a writer  artist  Spanish teacher  sister    If they only knew that I spent 95  of my life either in the grips of or treating  reporting to my team  traveling to treatment  etc   the disease  You know  I went out   to a non drinking gathering  but came home early and now have my two dogs  a 12yr old and a 7 yr old  and am very happy in the bed with them   Happy New Year  may 2017 surprise us all with good things  peace and less displaced and refugee peoples  That is at least ONE worry off the plate right    you are beautiful and i loved your post   the part about your son really hurt  i've done that to my son too  not tonight though   tonight we played board games and hung streamers and drank seltzer and had a real nice time   he's asleep in bed and i have taken care of both of us tonight  something i used to fail at often   thanks for your post and congrats on a sober 2016  No doubt this will be an awesome New Years for you sober  Oddly enough "86" was my first sober NYE  Let's keep racking them up  I won't drink with you tonight   I disagree with that  There comes a point where they are true friends  I quit SWTOR long before I quit gaming altogether but I'm still in a group chat with my guild  Hell  most of them don't even play anymore FWIW I was drinking minimum 2 pints of vodka throughout every day to keep from withdrawing  I had some wine before bed when I was staying at a hotel with my gf one night  and the next morning  nothing  I'm used to waking up with a bottle   At about 11AM I had a seizure and took an ambulance to spend 5 days in the hospital  Acute alcohol withdrawal  Just stay safe  Do what you need to do to remain sober  I know when I quit drinking  my mom who's also an alcoholic but actually went to her first meeting last week   KEPT trying to get me to drink with her  It was horrifying to me   Time to do this  We're glad that you're here and still looking for support  We do have to remove this post  as you admit drinking tonight   From our FAQ   https   www reddit com r stopdrinking wiki index wiki post only while sober        Post only while sober       We recognize that many people spend months "lurking" this subreddit while drinking  You are welcome to read as much as you'd like while not sober  However  for the sake of everyone here  and for the sake of your own recovery  please only post or comment when you're sober  "Sober" means "not currently intoxicated or under the influence in any way " Go to a local tabletop gaming or comic shop  They usually will have open play sessions throughout the week for everything from D D to monopoly It sounds like they are more worried about what you do when you're drunk and didn't want to risk it   I don't think they're trying to babysit you    Just 100  prevent bad things from happening possibly   Sorry for your feels  I know it's rough    But think honestly if it's for the best   I can't wait to celebrate your first anniversary next new years  That's awesome  In the meantime I plan to work on my judgmental  angry tendencies to improve my relationships with my wife and children  Oh  and stop cursing  If I can stop drinking for a year I should be able to tackle these w some focused attention  but it will still be challenging  Same time next year  I quit on Halloween this year   2017 will be my first full year as a non smoker since probably 1991 2   Congrats on quitting and best of luck all you new quitters   lmao Happy New Year   I am also hanging out watching tv and I feel great about it  Can't wait to wake up to a hangover free morning  I'll see you in a year  and hopefully a bunch between now and then  Happy New Years   Marshall I can see why you feel bad  I have had the same issues  I get excluded and don't find out about parties till after  I was told they "didn't want to feel like I was judging them" if they were drinking and I was not  I haven't said a word  but I can tell me being sober bothers them a lot   That's their problem  I won't drink with you tonight  Happy New Year   The New Year will ring in with one week sober for me   I feel great   To a new beginning in 2017     Stay strong and enjoy the pancakes  I'm not drinking w you  I know the feeling  Every time I'm left alone and I know there is alcohol nearby I just want to grab it and drink it all regardless of the shit storm that I would bring upon myself   Wooo     Congrats on two years  I've gone out with friends after I stopped drinking  although not as much   Most people don't seem to care that I'm not drinking   I do find while sober I have much lower tolerance for drunk people though  Reading instead of watching tv   Keep checking in  Hang in there  I wish I stopped at 27  I would have gained 7 years looking back now  But I had to go thru it to get where I'm at now  It's all forward from here  When you wake up you have a new page on a 365 page book   not my quote but read it today somewhere and it stuck with me   I've lost streaks of over two years  It's crushing  but the only way out is forward  and the more I learn about how to dig out  the better it gets     I'm with you  I ate four cookies   but didn't drink  Feels fantastic   Remember the program of recovery is outlined in the first 164 pages of the big book  Meetings are the fellowship with is synonymous with the big book  Try going through the Joe and Charlie big book study    You are 100  welcome in AA meetings  However if you asked me to be your sponsor I wouldn't be able to work steps with you unless you were off of all mood and mind altering substances   Sree pigs in blanket  I know my past with alcohol is bad  but it was the fact that I was trying to make an effort to show the change I'm making that went unnoticed    Being codependent and clingy just annoys people  I've learned    Would that I could spend it on alcohol  I'm 20  Going to inpatient on the 10th  so that'll be good  So with you  I just ate a pound of chicken wings  A  pound      We'd put 4000 calories in alcohol and not blink  And then probably eat 4000 more before bed  At least I would have lol  Least of my worries is food these days  I'm treating myself during these holidays  You should too  Happy new year  Thanks for the laugh  Would being shirtless be so bad  You're in texas right now  must be hot    hugs  if you want to talk feel free to send me a message   I can try to empathize    I know I'm close to the deadline  but I'd like to sign up for 2017  I'm in  Boneless  Or bone in   Indeed    The finish line is in 20 min   A big congratulations to the people who participated and a big congratulations to the people who successfully completed the challenge  Probably getting buried but I just wanted to say that I had a serious drinking problem nobody knew of  drinking a lot and getting blackouts regularly  and I set myself to stop drinking to get my shit together  Here I am on new years eve completely sober after spending a good time with some friends  Just felt like sharing this since I really feel great even though it sounds so ridiculously small  well it's been two hours  I'll check back in later Congrats      Loving all the 1 year posts today  I'll sign up I am sorry  Alcoholism is heartbreaking    The best thing you can do for your brother is to get support and information for yourself  I went to Alanon meetings which helped me cope with the alcoholism of a loved one  Alanon is a support group for friends and family of  alcoholics  See r Alanon    You can talk to your brother  but don't expect him to like what you have to say  Denial is a primary symptom of alcoholism  I cannot control another person's behavior but I can get help for myself  Alanon meetings are almost everywhere   I spent my NYE at home staring at a ceiling  I hope that superstition isn't true  At least if it is true  then that means I'll be sober  I'm feeling pretty weird about being around anyone at all who is drinking  It's like a barrier to connection  I can see the disconnect in the eyes   like no one is home    I had a late lunch with a friend today and a drunk guy there tried to wish us a good new year  He also waved his beer around rudely to ask the waitress for another  It gave me huge anxiety to witness and be addressed by him like that    So grateful I don't have to be that way ever again  Hello and welcome   u HARDKOREbear  If you look in the sidebar of  r alcoholism and scroll near the bottom you will find information about going to your first AA meeting  AA was very helpful to me  It is comforting to be in a room with people who understand and who also want to stop drinking  I'm glad you're here   Oh wow congrats on your one year  I'm ready for a sober 2017  What everyone else said  You'll just have hating yourself on top of the argument  Just have a nice hug forgiveness  I've been where you are a hundred times and try to think of what I  really  want  It's to be happy  connected to those I love  and a good life   Regardless of  what   exactly  it is I really want    cigarettes can't do it  Keep trucking  47 days is  amazing     Depends what your end goal is  If you want a clearer mind and to stop objectifying women  stop watching porn    If you want girls to notice you  stop masturbating   Soory to hear that  BOY does this resenate right now   I'm currently visiting some family  first time traveling since I got sober 15 months ago  and the next time I go down will be when I'm reincarnated into a fucking palm trees   I had a grandpa die of cirrhosis at 74 as well  never met the guy  but my mom told me his drinking got really heavy when her brother was in Vietnam  and he was the only son in the family     Anyways  family can be a salted lemon on a papercut sometimes  and this trip has been a test of love and tolereance for me  Thankfully I'll be flying home Tuesday   Stay strong  good luck  and Happy New Year  i would almost say running turns into an addiction  i went for a 6 mile run in the cold  rain today because i am training for a half marathon  and i guess only because it is running it is ok  if i ran for 6 miles in the rain for any other reason that made me feel kinda good  alcohol  weed  drugs  people would say I have a huge problem that i need to address  but yes  I am very pleased to have this as my "addiction" as opposed to alcohol or drugs  i just wish i could meet more people  and ladies  doing it  I "quit" for about a year but relapsed when I got out of a relationship  Doing it again now and about two weeks in  Kudos for five days  You gave your kids some positive memories tonight  I'm glad you're here  20 47 in L A   a little late checking in   A little sad tonight  but very happy to be sober with you all      xXx Being dead is more boring Absolutely man   Im totally supporting you remotely and your struggle is in my thoughts  even though we are strangers I know to some degree what you are going through and realize how much of a battle it is  I eventually went the sub route and im glad i did   but ive done the cold turkey    I wouldnt think of it strictly as fake bliss  Others may disagree with me but its sounds like you had some legitimately good memories with your sister before and it doesnt matter if you were high  Especially if you werent super intoxicated and nodding  Either way   im sure you are looking forward to seeing your sister and im happy you are going to be able to see her soon   If you are making do without the pharmacy then all the power to you man  Thats awesome  I was pretty dependent on the clonazepam when i came off opiates last so it was a struggle for me  Sounds like you have a handle on things and have an inventory on what you need to do  If you can stay objective and just keep in mind why you need to do this   why you just wont be as happy or fulfilled or able to flourish when constantly chasing an addiction   then you'll mae it through to the other side  I always found the insomnia  lack of energy and the depression the central aspects of wd  The clonidine does make sleep possible by just easing up the rls some  Though if you are sleeping at all already that is a good thing    Anyway   just as one human being to another   I am immensely proud of you and admire your sheer determination and ability to stay calm and rational through this  You sound like a pretty incredible person and I just know your family   friends and significant other are going to love to see how well you will do in the future  Keep going brother   peace and inner strength be with you through these dark   difficult times  Happy New Year and CONGRATS ON DAY 5  Thank you  Happy new years  In October I took a two month break from drinking  tried to moderate and then after an increasingly boozy December I culminated in a 20 drink blackout night  Two days ago I decided I was done  I ran my experiment and accepted the results  My first New Years with zero alcohol since I was probably 12 or 13  I'm looking forward to my new life  Happy new years  Thank you so much  Alanon seems like it will be a really helpful resource  I really wanted to vent to him tonight and express how mad and sad and embarrassed I am  but I don't think anything I have to say will even register while he's this drunk  I feel like I need to say something  even if it's poorly received  bc that would better than just saying nothing at all  I also left my boyfriend on his own  just to stay home and supervise my brother in case he wakes up and wants to try something reckless  And now I feel terrible  like that was the wrong decision too  Apologies for the rant  I just feel like there's no one else to express this to right now   Try not to let it offend you man  Seems to me your friend is trying to help  even if his efforts didn't make you feel good  try to feel good that he cares enough to try  Honestly one of my old buddies invited me to come to a "cheers to the governor party" which is an old drinking game we used to play  I told him no thanks  but even after over 100 days booze free while the party was happening I was wishing I didn't know about it because I wished so so so badly I could go drink and be a normal dude with my friends just for one night  Congrats  I'm not far behind you  First one sober since 1984 for me   Exposure response prevention  ERP  therapy is a type of cognitive behavioural therapy  CBT  used to treat OCD spectrum  and other  disorders  of which CSP is classified in the DSM 5     It could be much worse  You could be Mariah Carey right now  Right  For crispy skin  it's gotta be super dry before hitting oven heat  Otherwise  it'll steam and get soggy  A hair dryer gets rid of the clingy hidden water  and it's faster than patting it with a million kitchen towels that never really work  and who has that many towels  Fuck that   I'm in Definitely online meetings  Well  let's give it a go   I'm in  What an accomplishment  I am thrilled for you  You did great and I think that the way you're thinking about it is so positive  it would be so easy to just let yourself slip back into it  But you aren't letting that happen  because you have the control  Good for you  Good for them  It all helps  Exercise helps a lot  just keep doing it      Taking clonodine will make the sweats go away within 30 min   This is a good place to share  I certainly wouldn't call what you have to say a "rant"  You are upset and worried    Taking care of your adult brother is not your job  One of the things I learned in Alanon was to take better care of myself     Your brother will not likely feel so great in the morning  Talking to someone when they are drunk is  of course  a waste of time  If you decide to talk with him  rather than focus on "you have a problem"  share more how his drinking is affecting your relationship and mention some of his risky behaviors that scare you  Don't be surprised if he turns it back and blames you  Come from a loving place  If you don't think you can do that right now  I'd wait until you aren't so angry  People are more likely to listen when we are calm    I think you'd find Alanon interesting and helpful  Even taking time to browse the subreddit is educational  I'm glad you posted tonight   Stay strong   Welcome to the good life   Day 1 too  we will be okay  It always feels the hardest the first few days  each day will get easier and   can we really continue the way we are  Do we want to  Try remember and don't let your mind manipulate you  you WILL have strong urges to smoke  you WILL feel uncomfortable  Just try hold on  because it WILL pass   Thank you  I see you are asking the same question in many places  She has asked you to give her space  as you mentioned in your comments on  r alcoholism  It doesn't mean you have to go a whole year without sex with her  but it sounds like it is important to you to have sex now and you want to hear that it's ok  in spite of the fact that she already told you  in more ways than one  that she doesn't want to think about it at the present time  She said "I don't know"  Instead of pressuring her  get help for yourself  Alanon meetings are a good place to start  They helped me deal with the alcoholism of a loved one  As a woman  when someone asks how I feel about something  especially sex  it means a lot when they listen   That's some heavy stuff  One theme seemed to be prioritizing alcohol even when it didn't make sense  Good for you to break the cycle   It is both my honor and pleasure to host the first week of the new year  Please join me in making this the best year by not having a drink with me today  Just today  With peace and love to this  the best community on Reddit   F' 2016    iDoneDo Hmm  I haven't heard of it but I'll check it out  I'm always open to any kind

give them the dealers number so you can recall it and delete it in the interm   or tell your dealer your plan and ask them to call you after x amount of time    Also  what  u whatisinmyhead  is spot on  Cravings wax and wane  They will go  In that craving moment   do not still idle  Go out to a mall  meet a non smoker  go to the cinema  join a gym and train etc  just get busy  Try not to stay at home in the early days of quiting  I promise you the cravings get much more easier overtime    I tell myself  nothing bad is going to happen to me if I do not smoke  I am good as I am  I am almost 2 years sober  I still get cravings a couple of times a month    but know   I recieve it  confirm it  and say to myself "Wow  you still around bitch  Interesting    now fuck off you whore"  OR "Hmmm     a weed craving  Interesting  so how long you going to last this time  lets start the clock"   I look at the time and start to browse the web or something   within 1   2 mintues  its gone and after a few hours I rememeber   "Oh fuck  I forgot to time the craving"   then I pat myself on the back and smile   Happy New year   I won't drink today Tonight I regifted a bottle of wine that was given to me for xmas   Bed 10 10 would recommend  I have a similar situation  broke up with a girl so I can focus on myself   this was months ago   I was drinking with friends and alone browsing the internet or watching movies   everynight    I found out recently that she has a new bf and it really hit me   I've been replaced but someone who possibly is "better" than me   This really was a flame under my ass for self improve  She found someone else while I was "working on myself"   I haven't worked out shit for myself   All I see in the mirror is a tired  bloated  red faced guy   That's not the guy that I want to be    I think in this case  it's best to try to flip the script   Self improving yourself and quit drinking and build a better 'you' than you were when she knew you   She will find out your improvements and your newfound confidence   I think being sober can give you an edge and will be a catalyst of good things to come  Sweet  Hang in there  Thank you  Yes it is a blessing to be able to be here with him during his final days  We just want him to know that we're here and that we love him very much  I'm so thankful that I'm sober today  I can honestly say that drinking is the furthest thing from my mind today because of SD  Awesome Whatever it takes  Thanks for the advice   I've lurked r benodiazepines longer than CA  just not very frequently   FWIW  I totally agree  mixing the two is dangerous and stupid   My excuse was to use one to get free of the other   Didn't turn out that way     As for specific benzos  yeah  I actually quit 'tiz CT  went through horrible WD  but didn't have seizures that required hospitalization   Just crazy shakes and an unending LSD like nightmare of a bad trip for 2 weeks   Clonazolam has a vastly longer half life  though  and I actually tapered WAY down with it pretty well   I was at around 200 micrograms a day   But shitty things happened in life  and I started taking more and trying to drink again   You're probably right  diclaepam would be more ideal for a long term taper  it's one I've never actually tried  but I know valium is generally what's prescribed for benzo tapers   but I had success with clonazolam before  I'm hoping I can do it again      Anyway  the advice is appreciated  You're not alone at all  we are all here  I'm watching a movie and checking up on my SD peeps and also not drinking  I'm sorry about what happened to your mother and that you are experiencing the pain of her alcohol abuse  You can gently suggest therapy  It can be very helpful  It is possible that Mom may not even remember that she told you about the abuse   There is little we can do to change other people  especially when it comes to their abusing alcohol  Alanon is a support group for friends and family of alcoholics  See  r Alanon  Meetings are almost everywhere  They helped me cope with the alcoholism of loved ones   Checking in  New Years Resolution quitter here  cold turkey  One failed attempt in November  This time around it'll be easier since I have another person in the household quitting also  hopefully we can motivate one another  Although there is still one more smoker in the house  Midnight struck and I broke the last 6 cigarettes in my pack    Have a happy and safe new year everyone  Best of luck to those quitting tonight  We got this and we can help each other through    If anyone cares to message me when having a bad day or about to fall off the wagon  please do so  Friends who quit together  stay together   Godspeed fellow leaver and happy new year friend   Stay strong  it sucks you're having a rough time but you'll be okay  Awesome on the 5K  You're right  it is possible  When I went without picking before  my mindset was everything  And yeah staying away from the mirror as much as possible is definitely a good idea  I know all too well that for me  inspection leads to touching which almost always leads to a lengthy picking session    It's interesting that you brought up the way you thought as a child  I should try it from that perspective  I mean hell  when I was a kid it was a fight to even get me in the bath because I was so focused on other things like playing and being with friends  Now the amount of time I spend in the bathroom excessively grooming is embarrassing  I think I've known this deep down for a long time  and it seems so damn obvious  but I need to get my priorities straight  And making sure all my pores are cleaned out and my makeup covers all my flaws  or attempts to  should be lower on my list  I know I felt a lot better when I was able to let go and I want that feeling again  This month  I can at least earnestly try and not give up so easily like I usually do   Curry always makes you feel better Congratulations  and Happy New Year  Way to go  Drinking sucks in every way  Easier to think straight sober  pursue what you really want    I still go out  It's different sober  and in a lot of ways its better  But it was fun having a drink  too  But  I didn't usually have a problem out  I would drink heavy when I got back home  Sober is better for me on both counts  to be honest it was more like a year  Faced an eviction due to terrible parentals  plus constant arguments and a bout of homelessness and I just kinda said fuck it  Plus major depression and a lack of giving a shit   Soooo glad to hear   Yoooo  where in door county  Good egg is where it's at There is a twilight zone marathon on TV so that plus the obvious  There is a twilight zone marathon on TV so that plus the obvious  Oh  my god  Me too  I was never so cold as a November December getting clean  And every time I'm cold now  it feels like being sick  Hot baths save me sometimes  Here with you too  New Year's Resolution   Here is to leaving behind so much toxic in my life in 2016  first and foremost alcohol   I won't drink with any of you today   You did nothing wrong  your friend just had a blunt way of telling you he was worried about your comitment to not drink  Its best you got the argument out of the way now then at the party  New Years is overrated  I'm in bed too  Happy 2017   Sounds like a true  thoughtful friend to me    Not drinking today  just kickin' ass  Definitely going to focus on me for a while  I need this  I'm going to come out of this stronger  Thanks  guys  I will not drink today  Those Imperial IPAs  like 8 to 11 per cent alcohol  I always got into them because it's "craft " I was a connoisseur  supporting local breweries  And the scotch  well  I'm an aficionado    Thank you for hosting the first week of 2017   I'm in   I love it when that happens  had it happen to me once at 3am  Lucky for me I was sober  Could have been a horrible night otherwise  Enjoy your hike  and Happy New Year  coherence  memories  health  wealth  friends  love and happiness  One of my goals is to get out of my own head and not overthink things  Did you find that physical activity helps with this  This NYE was a strange one for me 1  being newly sober and 2  apathetic for the first time ever about the holiday  I guess what bothered me was that I wasn't doing what is expected of pretty much everyone tonight  moreso getting an invite from a friend I somewhat fell out with a few months ago to come to her party  We'd already been texting before the invitation came up so I couldn't just ignore the text and pretend I never saw it or something  I ended up just telling her I was sick and thanking her anyway  to which she never responded  probably knowing it was bullshit    I have a lot of reasons to say no  but for my continued well being  sobriety is a priority  I've been regretting all those sloppy nights of just getting wasted and it makes me embarrassed and sick to think about  yet the thought of drinking still had a seductive quality regardless    I'm glad I stayed home  I know I'm not missing out on anything  The combination of being forced to socialize  sloppy drunks  and the temptation to relapse just isn't appealing  I'll take sweatpants  cookies  my fur babies  and Netflix over that noise any day    I'm proud of all of you for staying sober tonight  and I wish you further success and happiness in the new year  Cheers  SD   Easy  Just dont put yourself around it  You got to understand that it is so easy like cigarettes now to normalize it  If you see someone sparking up cool  just walk away from it  Someone asks you just say no  Hardest thing is being around legalization conversations and parties  Actually no the hardest thing is being at a party and its there and a stoner lectures you about the William Randolph Hurst shit and people gang on you  I was around the drug scene for a long time  and now I just prefer not to associate with those types of people  If you put yourself in enough negative situations around drugs cocaine weed shrooms even booze  you will put yourself in trouble eventually  Live is very long and while you can have all the will power in the world having safe places and non smoking friends is a must  I know reddit isn't for religion but joining a church is cool too do be aware you may be judged by it a little harshly but most people will always respect someone trying to better themselves  Your university likely has free counseling services  It's just like therapy  please reach out   I'm also enjoying a lot of snacks and food tonight  but worth it  I'm enjoying ringing in 2017 sober  Your not alone  I started 6 days ago just so that I wouldn't struggle so much with my other resolutions  Goodluck mate  I will not drink today  For any reason good or bad  Strength in numbers   Makes sense  Especially if you think of valuing yourself so highly that you don't want to drink  It's just something that you choose not to do  I graduated a few years ago and it was certainly around but not even close to what it was today  my senior year was 2014 and that was when weed was just starting to become accepted in the public eye  I could only imagine how bad it is in uni now lol   Difference is someone is likely not going to get drunk off one beer  I was a nightly drinker too of 1 2 beers and it did nothing for me  Was it a dependence  Sure  Did it mess my life up  Kind of  But nowhere near as bad as consistently smoking  It is weird but honestly the booze was the easiest thing for me to quit  I just quit buying and at parties I would have 1 and switch to seltzer  I quit that and cigarettes no problems  but pot which was my least favorite vice remains the hardest to quit  Funny how life works  That's awesome  congrats  Hey buddy   Happy new year   Had to take them to the shop   Wheel building is an art   I guess I should have been more specific about the spokes being already installed    i hope you had a nice Christmas  We were in Disney for a week   Weather was great   Came back to cold and windy   Burrrr  Right there with you  I just had a five course meal that consisted of mostly TJ's appetizers and sparkling cider  I don't even want to know how many calories I shoveled into my body  But I didn't drink and had the best NYE I've had since I can remember  Worth  It     hang in there  you are making amazing progress on yourself  7 5 months is a huge accomplishment   hugs  So sorry  A stranger on the Internet is sending you a hug  I will not drink today   FTZ baby    2 hours and 10 mins to midnight here  I will not drink tonight or tomorrow  Wow  so much of this reminds me of my dad  I lived with him most of the last 6 years  I'm now 34   and I kept getting more and more frustrated with being around him every time he drank  The repetition and talking over me or people constantly got under my skin to the point where I would drink more to calm myself down   I moved out a few months ago  and he tried to stop drinking  But he's been an alcoholic longer than I've been alive  and he has just never given it his full commitment  So in less than a week after I left  he was back at it  He kept telling me he'd stopped drinking  But then he would call me  drunk  He kept telling me he's happier than he's ever been  since he started dating his new gf  they started dating as soon as I left  and initially she was a reason he tried to curb his drinking   But as happy as he said he was when he claimed to have stopped drinking for a bit  he just couldn't give up the alcohol  Now he's got blood pressure problems  and I am thinking early stage liver failure  Watching all of that is terrifying  and horrible  and gives me even more resolve to not put myself or the rest of my family through that   Reading stories like yours really helps me feel like I'm not the only one going through this  thanks for posting it  Wishing you a peaceful and happy new year  I will gladly not drink with you     Thank you  Happy new year  I am out and sober and drunk people are kinda annoying and I am tired  There is no proof of that        Seriously tho  you're correct  I know what you're getting at the first week is the worst  it does get much better  Being sick blows  I puked a bunch of bile yesterday  no fun  Feel better dude  Checking in   Went to a get together  everyone drinking  had no desire to do so    success    Same friend always says  I need to drink    Today I got a bit more aggressive with my no    Kratom is very weird man  Wd comes in waves  I'll be maintaining on my taper and feel feel  Then a couple days later I wake up with sweats and akithisia  Didn't happen my first time quitting though  Got better each day  So it's hard to predict  Just know the waves do get better soon  Expect the ups and downs and remain calm  It will calm down soon  And by the way  kratom has a very short half life  but there are some alkaloids that take longer  Perhaps the serotonigenic alkaloids are delayed hence the mental aspect getting worse after a few days  Stay strong buddy  it'll be over before you know it and you'll be happy it was easier than other withdrawals you've already experienced  Well  tonight  you and I have something in common when it comes to feeling alone and just generally feeling crappy about life  All I know is if I drink It'll only make it worse  A lot worse  I will not drink with you tonight  Here's another internet hug  I hope things look up soon   Right on  Happy new year  sobernauts  You should be fine in terms of brain chemistry  but I don't have the background to confirm    In my books   it's a slip  not relapse  you do need to be more careful though  You are in a high risk zone    2nd smoke is a no go  I've been clean for a while now  almost 2 years  and if I get the smallest hint of 2nd smoke I can feel it  cause  sadly  I know the feeling all too well    Hope this helps  and happy new year my dear non stoner  Peace    Awesome  Congratulations   I really hope hit hit a year    thanks for inspiring story  Despite some of the set backs that are out of your control it sounds like you are on a good path  Keep going and keep growing    I'm getting to the point where I don't want to interact with my SO  when she drinks   Her face goes slack and her eyes are dull  it's like her loveable self is gone   I can't believe my children had to deal with us both being like that   Never again   A girlfriend I lost partially due to my heavy drinking and partially due to my increasing involvement in crime   Writing   Not much else that I can think of  Plenty of stuff I enjoyed  and did throughout my drinking career as well but I can take or leave most of it   No chance of recovering the former   I now make my living doing the latter    C'est la vie  Still awake because my drunk neighbors and their shitty karaoke  but I will not drink today  Beautiful  Thank you for the inspiration   Happy sober new year     Thanks to this sub I just completed my first calendar year sober     Here's to one more sober day    i listen to a ton of recovery podcasts  like The Bubble Hour and Recovery Elevator  they have been a game changer in preventing me from having those "what if" moments  I literally listen to several a day as protection from my inner addict when she starts to whisper    Same here  best of luck to ya mr sun  I thought you were gonna say  Actual sex with a person  But yeah  Pancakes with lingonberry is tops   Exactly  That buzz is just a sign that all my responsibilities for the night have now gone out the window and I "need" to order drink number three   I want to but then I get home from work and realize I don't have the motivation to do any of the shit that I want to do so I smoke a bowl instead   Yea  I am actually training for a rhythm and blues themed run in February  Not really going for time either but if I am going to shell out 70 dollars for a race  I had better get my mileage heh  out of it  Eventually I want to do a full marathon  it would be an amazing feat to accomplish in my life if only to train and do it at least once    As for yoga  I have tried to do that stuff  and it is too intense for me  My body does not bend that way anymore   Agreed  Sober me is so insecure and terrified hes gonna do it  Last bender as you know what rough dude   I never knew my shitposting reached such abominable levels    Happy New Years  you fucks  How true this is  I always thought someone would save me if I got bad enough  I blame Disney   happy new year  and with week one under your belt   congrats  Yeah this is true  Sounds like you're going to fit right in around here  I did too but lately everything reminds me of sex Just got off a double  brother  Here's to you  Love how this is tagged Cmon  you're a classic  You are good for staying home concerned about your brother  and yes tomorrow would be a better time to open a dialogue up about his over consumption  He is going to have to want help and I think you should know that no emotional appeal or consequences will sway him if he is in fact an alcoholic in my opinion  Alanon would be as said my first stop   sign me up please  I want to take part in this  Thanks  I was never able to stop picking even though it has been my new year's resolution for years now  So this year I will try "No new scars"  I know I can't stop completely  yet  but I hope it will keep me from picking the same spot over and over again    Good luck to everyone  3   Oh believe me  I'm genuinely happy to see the old comments and posts I can't even remember show up here     Hope yer having a good night   BeClean17 Woohoo  Suck it  2016     I will celebratingly not drink with all my fellow SDers today  Gotta go find me some black eye peas  greens   cornbread to eat today      My condolences to you and yours  I'm not gonna drink with you tonight   Hi   I'm glad you're here  There was a time in my life   not long ago  when I could go for weeks and not talk to a soul if  I didn't go to a store or out for a walk  I spent days not talking to anyone  This was after a breakup   Just want you to know that I get it  Holidays are the worst sometimes  Many times  I  think there is a tendency to measure the whole of my life based on the distorted metric of how a holiday went   But I hear you  and I'm sorry you're in pain  I think it's fine to cry  but I hope that when you're done you will acknowledge your strength and the wonderful gift you have given yourself  I'm sending you a hug  and we may be strangers  but you are not alone  32 days in an incredible accomplishment as well  First one sober for me in 12 years  I could get used to this I wish I had some promising words  but what you do tonight is your choice  We all obviously don't want you to break sobriety  Relationships are ridiculous difficult with the wrong person  I wish you the best  and be smart with your night  You are never truly alone  not anymore   Happy new year SD  Checking in for January 1st and so proud that I made it through the holiday season sober for the first time in many  MANY years  I feel amazing  Bring on 2017   Nintendo  the outdoors  sports  reading  day dreaming     Now that I've got some sober time  I realize it's the same stuff I love now  I've said before sobriety is like learning to be a kid again   I made it through a crowded party surrounded by beer I am so glad I don't have to drink anymore  No drinking for me today  I made it through a crowded party surrounded by beer I am so glad I don't have to drink anymore  No drinking for me today  Not drinking today  Happy new year  I decided to stay in tonight too  A good choice  I'm about to get a great night's sleep   I will not drink today  I made it through 6 hours at a party surrounded by beer and I was not tempted  I am glad to be a non drinker  Still have 3 hours till he New Year and Sunday but I will get in an early pledge   I will not drink today and I hope like hell that I have not touched a drop at this time next year   Thanks SD   Wishing all a good and sober 2017   You have trained your brain to the point where gaming becomes a reflex when the going gets tough  which is a habit you must break now   You certainly hit the nail on the head  And honestly your words are sharp but it is very apt and couldn't have been worded better   My first reaction was disappointment in realizing me having to stay away from streams also  but if it's what is required to make it work  then that my life  has more priority  A lot of unsubscribing but it's for the better  thank you for your response   I appreciate your advice My wife is hammered right now  And was supposed to quit with me last week  So we have been on different wave lengths all night  I know she wishes I was drinking  I probably just remind her that she should be sober also  Misery loves company   Anything going on there now  Like everyone else who commented said  this really resonates with me  I've been drinking and masking for so long that I have no idea who I really am  So    what if this is when I get to decide  as a well informed and now sober adult  what kind of person I  want  to be  It's pretty exciting  to be able to examine what I've got going on inside and tease out the traits that I really like and want to show to the world   You are kind and compassionate  I hope you internalize and know that  Even on a small scale  even if it's just a Reddit outreach  you make the world a kinder place  Errybody needs dat  The first start of the year sober in a long time  I will not drink today  You're very welcome  Just to be clear  my brother didn't commit suicide  at least as best as we can determine   the overdose was accidental   Hey man  I'm youtube com riickshaw  A weedtuber  And this is going to be surprising as fuck to anyone who knows me and sees this  but  me too    I'm medicinal and approved to grow   extract  so I'm not putting the lady down forever  But I am done consuming her for recreation    Write on your hand "your brain's rewiring" every time you want to smoke  look at your hand    Help me  help you  help each other  Happy 2017  every one   If your journey is anything like mine  you are about to get some relief   I believe the worst I experienced was in the first 4 days   Naked Mind as mentioned earlier was huge for me   Started concentrating more on looking forward than thinking about how much I want a drink   Wishing you the best  I pictured a friend's house as you were describing the hippie pad  Also someone in the program  I'm all for expressing spirituality in whatever ways you want  but why is it that when some people get clean  they just have to take it a little too far  I know many people who were raised Christian or Catholic  then suddenly want to be Zen masters when they get into recovery  Again  I'm not aiming to offend anyone  just something I noticed and do find a little silly   Anyway  'grats on the ten months  Some days will be harder to get through than others as I'm sure you've noticed  But each day you don't use is a successful day  I've realized that the more time I get under my belt  the less frequent those shitty days are  Happy New year  You can also put on a mask sheet while you're doing your hair  Helps your skin and you can't pick through it  I like  these ones  https   www amazon com SAEM Natural Facial Sheet Sheets dp B01LYO4Y4K ref sr 1 9 s it s beauty ie UTF8 qid 1483251489 sr 1 9 keywords facial mask sheet  not least because they're cheap but also they smell pretty good  I was driving around a ton tonight and no one would pull me over   I was so hoping for a sobriety checkpoint  Thank you   Thank you  too  Happy Hogmanay  And New Year  too  what the hell  You should visit him early and be really cheerful and loud   "GOOD MORNING  FRIEND   You throw his curtains open at this point and watch him recoil at the light  HOW ARE YA   just to be a dick I just got in from 8 hrs at the bars  Didn't drink  been sober about 15 months  It's great to know your going home safe and you can make smart decisions  Congrats on not drinking tonight    Still playing  but no one else Earlier in this conversation  you wrote     just waiting to die   u LykkeStrom is right   Debt is no fun  but it's better to go into more debt than to sit there waiting to die   You might have some sort of depressive psychological condition     Im in the US not Europe    Support groups  If you have a psychological condition  and know what it is   Support groups can be helpful   In person support groups are one option   Or you could look for a sub Reddit for people with your condition     If you need one on one counselling  You might be able to find a local therapist or marriage and family therapist or psychologist who can help you for cheaper or free   Phone around to various providers and find out who can do this   See  here  https   en wikipedia org wiki Charity care    Or you could try contacting your local family service agency  if there is one   They may not only help children  they may also provide free or cheap counselling for adults too     If you need medications but cannot afford a psychiatrist  You might be able to find a local psychiatrist who can help you for cheap or free   Phone around to various psychiatrists and find out who can do this   See  here  https   en wikipedia org wiki Charity care      If you need medications and can pay for a psychiatrist  Here's a link to some  information  https   en wikipedia org wiki Amwell app  on the Amwell mobile app   In  some US states  https   amwell com cm services online psychiatry    the app lets you see a psychiatrist using videoconferencing   It's probably cheaper to use the app than to pay the full price of an in person visit to a local psychiatrist   They can fax prescriptions to your local pharmacy   Ask the psychiatrist to please include a few refills on your prescription   If possible  ask the psychiatrist to please email a treatment plan to a family doctor of your choosing  maybe then the family doctor can treat you in the future     Paying less for prescriptions  Ask the doctor to prescribe you generic medications  and see GoodRx com to see where you can get the prescribed medications for cheaper     Conclusion  Would any of this work for you  I told myself I'd quit before I turned 26  I turn 26 in a few weeks  It's been a decade of smoking  I need to do this  Got room for one more  Thanks for this   I'm literally having the opposite feeling     Wishing my better half was sober right now    She's certainly more fun sober   Think it clicked to me just now my life is too short to hang out with people that choose to be drunk and not present   Perhaps think of you  Welcome  you are in good company here   Hope to see you around    As an alcoholic  someone who says they like me better drinking is telling me they like me better dead   That is no friend I want   Perhaps they really mean early recovery can be stressful and they don't like me when I'm stressed out   Not wanting to be married to a non drinker is an asinine statement also   There are many good reasons for not drinking like pregnancy  health  recovery  religious beliefs  medications  etc   Best wishes for a better spouse in sobriety  Well here we are in the new year  I spent the night drink free with the wife and kids out to dinner and had a bottle of sparkling grape juice between all of us  Here's to starting the new year on the right foot  Happy new year everyone   It sounds like you really want to quit  so quit  CT it and dump your stash   That's they only way for people like us   For most  the first week or so is the worst  at least the physical part of the WDs   Once you get past that you'll start to see some light at the end of the tunnel     I was doing the same thing   stuck inside all the time  lost my job two years ago  dosing like every couple hours probably   I wasn't even keeping track   I using like 2 kilos a month at the end   All day  all night   Sleeping like 5 hours a night   Taking it just because  for no reason  getting no real effects anymore   The few times I did get the effects I wanted  I ended up chasing it and taking more the next night       Get some supplements  vitamins  etc   Check the side bar wiki and link below   Black seed oil  valerian root  and kava   kava tea   I wasn't really taking them early on  but the first time I took BSO and made a super strong cup of kava tea  I slept like a baby   didn't wake up once   Others swear by BSO here   That was probably the hardest part   not being able to sleep at all  when you're dead tired  and slept like 2 hours in the past 5 days   It is truly maddening      Up till recently  I haven't been clean in over 6 years from stuff   not ONCE for 24 hours   I was terrified that the WD would kill me   I'm still dealing with the mental aspects  but the early days weren't nearly as bad as I thought they were going to be   It goes by quickly       It is new years eve   there isn't a better day to start a new chapter in life   Life is always going to feel like shit when you're trying to quit   There will be lots of ups and downs early on   But it isn't going to get better until you stop   You can do it   Look at it this way too   do it while kratom is here to help you   Imagine how many people will go back down the hole to other things if it is banned   This is your best shot  take it while you can      https   www reddit com r quittingkratom comments 4lfu1t uys supplement guide v1  Thanks for the advice  I did exactly that and had a good time out with the family  We had sparkling grape juice and saw the ball drop   You should try it   I worked a double tonight  and one of my last tables was a loud and drunk crew of rich folks  They really got on my nerves  especially because I'd been hoping to get off before midnight to go kiss this girl I've been talking to when the clock struck  In the long run  none of it matters  my feelings about the people  their actions  the kiss  the New Year  All that matters is that I didn't put a drink in my mouth this evening  other than some kombucha  and can wake up moving towards being a better person  Last year  around this time  I was crying on my kitchen floor after my girlfriend at the time had berated me for being an alcoholic  Now  I'm lying in bed  sore and a little sad  but no longer stuck  Happy to have you all  Happy that I didn't drink with you all today  See you at the check in tomorrow  Peace  Thanks for sharing the advice  I find that after a couple days sober my mind's a lot clearer and I can stick to not smoking We didn't drink for new years  My want to start drinking is when I start dinner so I took the family out and we had sparkling grape juice when the ball dropped  Tomorrow is gonna suck  but I'm home and I will work through the hours   I'm in the same boat  my friend  This week I was told that she feels no passion towards me  and although we enjoy each other's company  and connect on an intellectual level  the physical attraction just isn't there for her     I have been rolling through waves of emotion  battered against the rocks  and I am certain you are feeling the same way  WE ARE NOT ALONE  In this sub we can certainly find someone among the 55 287 readers that can offer us some direct insight based on experience     Baringstraight  we can make it through this without a glass in our hands  It hurts  it sucks  but drinking will only add more problems to the mix     Not drinking with you  tonight  my comrade in arms  Didn't have a drink in 2016  not going to have a drink in 2017   I will not drink today  If he does   let's Kickstart this CA island  I discovered a major difference between sobriety and withdrawal   Withdrawal sucks  sobriety rocks   For me  sobriety was the long term result of much recovery activity   It didn't happen for me in weeks or months   I didn't get through post   acute withdrawal syndrome until after five months and even then didn't know it for a few more   I find significant behavioral changes to be challenging and sometimes painful   The feelings you describe sound like the normal  painful early stages of recovery   Best wishes to you for the patience to give time   time to work its magic  The only people who pressure others into drinking with them are the ones who feel uncomfortable with their own relationship with alcohol  Pressuring a sober alcoholic is a whole other realm of "what the fuck " Good for you for saying no  if it happens again I'd politely but firmly tell them you're never going to be interested and it's unappreciated to keep asking   Good luck  I started my quit attempt a few days ago   i don't really like new years resolutions   but a fresh start to the year is a great idea   I feel you    I'd say try starting by doing it with lights off or blindfold or just back facing him  It's also important that he knows about your insecurity and doesn't be a jerk about it  That is goood Congrats  your hard work is inspiring  and I agree about 2016  I haven't checked in in a while but I wouldn't miss this  Thank you  Just arrived home from a wonderful evening with friends and will hit the pillow completely sober  WE do have this  May 2017 be a fantastic one for you  Getting healthier is so much easier with a clear mind  I personally said fuck tobacco juices  I want fruit as fuck flavors  because why not  Some people do  but it's typically older people that have been smoking for decades Literally waht im doing tonight  No weed bc i cant stand the stuff  but i did eat today  so thats a win or something  should polish off this 30 pack in 2 hrs or so This is really impressive and inspiring  I have a friend who's pushing me to 'taper instead of going cold turkey' i e  smoke with him  Really amazing that you managed to say no  repeatedly  with your  partner   so much strength  great work  Louis Rossman made a video about his theory on why this happens   He said that he was never punished growing up  he said that when he did something bad  his dad would make him go sit in the study  and would then talk to him and explain why the thing he did was wrong  He then went on to say that parents just ground their kids or punish them  but that doesn't really teach them anything  and then once they're off on their own for the first time  they go crazy  because they were never pushed to think beyond the punishment  and now there's no one there to ground them anymore   Not sure if that's really true or not  but the post reminded me of it   I nearly posted a group chat for the drinking alone crew  Now I regret it  Hi  Tom  I'm glad that you haven't given up  and that you're still determined to get sober  I really admire that  I know you're probably feeling frustrated right now  but try not to beat yourself up about this  Pretty much all that does is make you feel worse  and it can make the urge to drink again that much stronger  Instead  maybe consider this a learning experience  If everyone could absolutely quit drinking the very first time they set out to  there would be no alcoholics  I doubt any one of us would even still be here  But you have a lot of wonderful people here in this sub who know what you're going through  and want to help you succeed      When I get frustrated  I remind myself again and again  to take sobriety a day at a time  I just focus on today  and worry about tomorrow when it gets here  And today  I will not drink with you  my friend  You can do this     Day 1 for me but not drinking today Are you quitting all of that cold turkey  This is my song for the new year https   www youtube com watch v 1XHhf06I ds O well I'm in bros   Is there a guide to make withdrawals tolerable  This was very interesting  Thank you  Fash  I'm surprised Urethra was so low considering he had the most meme'd phrase of the year  I was also surpised 03 15 was so high considering he has been absent for the latter half of the year  The top commenters  however  seem to represent contributions to CA proportionally    Happy new beers  everyone  Last night was my last drink    I'm joining this club because you guys and gals make me wanna feel what being sober is again   Happy New Year   I'm home alone and have no friends  to  party with   But I have a bottle of champagne  half a handle of whiskey and Netflix   Cheers  IMO  this expansion has caused a lot of people to quit and burnout because if anything  it's the most "WoW" expansion to date  Tons of people claim it's the best expansion to date  but they aren't even playing it anymore   It's thrown out a ton of content  dungeons  raids  repeatable daily quests  and sure that seems like a godsend after Draenor since there's a lot more progression  but none of it's that different  meaningful  engaging  or particularly innovative in terms of how the game has evolved  You spend a majority of time grinding out tons and tons of resources for meager power gains to do what  Faceroll dungeons or clear difficulties with uncoordinated groups   It's the same WoW we've been playing for 12 years   I feel ya man  My heart really does go out to you and I hope and pray for you and all of us tonight  We got this  Failed miserably made it through most of today and bought some gum  family vacation is in 2 days and I'm not about to ruin it due to the way I act during withdrawal  I'm currently  we rotate out  DJing at the party that made me stop drinking this past Halloween   I'm sober  but all my friends are wasted   This def isn't easy right now and I wish I could be more social   I really wish people would stop asking me where they can find drugs   The only reason I do this is because I love the music and making people dance  but fuck this is hard   We have people staying w us as well that will probably want to party at our house after this is done    Had a slight case of FOMO earlier  but now that I didn't drink I feel amazing  Thank you all for not drinking with me tonight  Happy New Year   And I cannot wait for the day I can be totally comfortable and happy in a drinking atmosphere while being sober   Thanks for giving me something to strive towards   I went out tonight  My boyfriend and I had dinner with two of my close friends  then we went to a party  Honestly  I was miserable the first hour of the party    I was very tempted to drink  But I didn't  and I didn't let myself go home  and I ended up having a blast  I danced for the first time in years and I've decided I'm going to take some lessons in the next few months  I left at 12 05 lol  so sleepy  and drove my boyfriend and I home safely   Feeling pretty damn good  South Island  I'm doing the heaphy  Kepler and routeburn track  And some smaller hikes in between  If everything works out      Where are you located   Happy first sober day of 2017  I'm not drinking today   Well good on you for defending your sobriety today by posting  I know that early on it can suck sometimes  Just know that if you stick with it one day at a time you will begin to feel much better and stuff will start to work itself out   I had the same issue  My longest sober streak this year had been  48 hours  I had to go motherfucking 54 hours sober for kkkristmas   My gf's family is apparently so ravished by drug abuse that they do a dry christmas  yeah  that's a thing  My own family's typical supply of alcohol was disrupted by my perceived "drinking problem" and my sister's fiance's puritanical values  I seriously despise the kid  but that's a story for another time    Happy CA Christmas to you  when all our familial obligations are exhausted  all the inlaws are back where they belong  and we can comfortably drink ourselves into oblivion   Oh it's the most wonderful time of the yearrrrrrrr  I will not drink today   Happy new year  here's to a better life  Happy New Year   I purchased The 30 Day Sobriety Solution on your recommendation   I start reading and my first "lesson" tomorrow   Hope it does for me what it seems to have done for you   My ex would watch this video over and over again  https   youtu be 1zeZhHq0WtY  Or if he had a craving he would just go outside and watch 5 minutes of it and come back to where he left off later  Good luck Shit like this is why I'm paranoid all the time  Well at least they didn't take your phone  pretty considerate  You too  I see you got there yourself not too long ago   my brother and I have just confronted my mother who is having the exact same problem  exercising at minimum an hour per day  she walks anywhere from 2 5 miles per day and sees a personal trainer a few times per week  goes to yoga once a week   In addition to her social drinking  drinks herself to sleep at night  often going to the fridge multiple times to refill her glass of wine after she has already tried to go to bed  How have you been able to combat the problem in other ways  or do you have any suggestions for how we can help her  4 days here   It's my number one new years resolution   I tried to quit on Christmas Eve and ended up smoking on Christmas   Usually when I fall off the nicotine wagon I give up quitting   not this time  A huge congratulations and a sparkling water toast  You're an inspiration to me  The biggest difference is that there is no end to it this time  even in Vanilla there was a point you could get to where you didn't need to grind endlessly though it was hard to reach  in Legion there isn't a single person that can say they don't need to get on for anything anymore  when you need over 50 million AP just for a single maxed weapon and titanforging makes it impossible to have the best gear you just can't stop  I've played WoW at a competitive level for years and I've never seen so many people quitting  even in WoD people were staying for at least the first part of it  Legion has a huge amount of great ideas but they implemented so many of them horrendously  i e  Legendaries are a good idea on paper but they picked up the idea and lost it along the way creating this shit system of 'get lucky or quit the game'   I find it interesting how some alcoholics will say they don't want to go to AA because it's embarrassing  Is that more embarrassing than stumbling home from the bar on the regular    7    They like me  They really like me   Either that or I'm just a shit show  I'll take either one  Thanks  I'm getting there  this is probably the first round of antibiotics I've taken in 5  years that I haven't consumed alcohol on  so I'm hoping my recovery time will be faster lol Thank you for your words  It really helps a lot  I was drinking more than a pint and often a liter of vodka every night near the end  You say up to 12 a night  What's typical   I did a taper down rather than cold turkey  I can only saw what I did  not really qualified to give medical advice  I basically did "halves"  So after a 1 liter night I did 1 pint the next night  Then I did a half pint  Etc down until only one beer  Then I stopped and haven't looked back    Pros  it's not as big of a shock on the system  I was less anxious  still like 7 10 on the scale at first though   Cons   you still drink  In my case I only procured exactly what I intended to drink  As most of us know it's really easy to just have "a little more" once we've started  The it spirals out of control    If you have someone that can help you taper  they control the alcohol  then it may be do able   thank you for sharing  you look amazing   lots of great stuff here    Purim seems like so much fun  fuck  It has the dressing up part of halloween but with more of an emphasis on getting fucked up  I can dig it   What was the thing you moderated  I  for one  am curious  Fuck  you know we love you   quitting is easy  staying quit is whats hard  because for me if its  not the craving that never goes away  its the health anxiety        Just soldier through it  My wife runs events and it's her job to host a big 300 person   NYE party  I'm proud of her and attending to support her  But I'm only drinking Coke  no La Croix in stock   Not drinking today and so happy to be in such fine company  Considering you're all a bunch of filthy animals I could still be a shit show  Call the member services number on the back of her Medicare card  of access her patient portal online  They will have resources for you  You can google "your state  Medicare substance abuse treatment" as well  It may be a bit tougher on the holiday weekend  but there is bound to be somewhere  Detox will probably be necessary first  so be sure to look into that as well  I do admissions for a treatment center  so let me know if you have any other questions    There are admissions processes and protocols that facilities have to follow if they are state licensed to bill Medicare  Some of these may be the things causing timing issues for you  It is going to be part of the process anywhere reputable that you contact   Id like to thank the academy  for the shakes  The three trips to the ER  Super props to the academy for getting the chick from psych to fuck me in Florida    Special shout out to Scotch  And let's hear it for homelessness    And finally   If it wasn't for Brenda I'd have never made it here    Thanks you fucking worthless fucking cunt   honestly the more times you relapse the more experience you get at actual quitting  if this helps  I'll tell you this  I bet they noticed  especially the kids  But here's the thing  people won't comment on a positive difference  I bet they think you're extra sociable and happy  a product of being sober  but think it's because of alcohol  Revel in this moment because it proves  as you said  you don't need alcohol  Honestly  fuck that Shit  Merry new years   Can I still sign up  For me it's been a path of rediscovery  rediscovering my hobbies and finding new ones  projects with wood  drawing  reading  learning  helping   I also have a toddler and pregnant wife so filling free time isn't too much of a problem lol  I wouldn't mind it being more of a problem actually  Already lawyered up and gearing up for court  I'm looking at 6 months probation  some community service  drug classes  and if I do everything right than I won't have a conviction on my record since it's my first criminal charge  the worst part of this whole thing is how expensive it all is  Lawyer is  750  than I have to pay for court fees and the drug tests and drug classes  On top of that I have to take time off from work to do community service  It's a struggle but I'm trying to stay positive  Sure  I wish to Christ I could feel filthy again    Time to fuck a whore on a Sunday morning   A lot of good people to talk you through it here   Need a taper plan   No problem   Need help with WD symptoms   Just ask  I won't drink today with the rest of you awesome people   I just got home from my SO's NYE party  Arrived at 9  left at 2  and didn't have a drop to drink  When I made the choice to become sober this November  NYE was the night I worried about most  I'm so proud to have made it here  Can't wait to ring in the New Year tomorrow morning with energy  clarity  and GOOD vibes  Happy New Year everyone  I will not drink with you in 2017  So excited to wake up tomorrow and welcome the first day of 2017 without a brutal hangover  So proud to be here with all of you  I will not drink today  Happy New Year  SD           Thx everyone  To be honest  I was actually reminiscing about the unspeakable shortly after posting that  but sharing the burden with y'all really helped me keep my focus  I love how refreshing it is to be free  Macgregor is poison  I always take statistics with a grain of salt  I dont know how to word this but do people who don't relapse seek less help making it biased  I e  they see the people returning to groups or therapy but not the ones who make it on their own  Thanks for your support  Just got home and I stuck to my guns  Got to be the dd for a few extra friends who were very greatful  Also saw a girl get carried out of the bar and taken away in an ambulance covered in her own vomit  It's definitely an interesting experience just watching a bunch of people get hammered and being able to really notice the difference in how they act as the night goes on  Here's to day 4 of many more  cheers Sorry  Wasn't sure if everyone would be notified if I just posted it as another comment     I mostly lurk  Congrats and seltzer cheers to you  Here's hoping for a less turbulent 2017     Congrats  what a great feeling that must be      and such a perfect start to the year  yay  We're in the middle of summer at the moment  Damn aussies haha  we had a 42c day this week   way hot lol  But yes  I'll have to get back into the gym  being fat sucks    It feels so good doesn't it  So pure and so powerful  Congrats to you honey and your family  Happy NY  Happy New Years guys   Last New Years my first sober  was awful  I was angry  sad  alone  But if I hadn't gotten through that  I wouldn't be where I am today  It gets better   Good work dude  Was the predominant problem in my mixed bag of a drug problem  very glad to be rid of it  At 43  I think I can handle being around alcohol  but I have no idea about being around drinking  There's always going to be somebody who offers  maybe they're drunk and forgot you don't drink  maybe they're a stranger and never knew  but saying no to actual alcohol actually being handed to me is exactly where I failed last time I did   First sober NY in over 10 years  I will not drink with you today    Lol Wow  two years  congratulations  Kinda cool too that you have a good "anniversary" date    way easy to evaluate the changes    Since you asked  p  writing is something I've been wanting to get back into for a long time  I'm around 8 months so still working on myself but I like how you put it  that it's more within reach now that I've been sober for a little while  Would have been impossible when I drank  so it's closer  but still seems challenging  Hopefully next New Years I will check in to say I've made progress  Thanks for the great post   I will not drink today  I was attended at AA party but things got a little heatened up  I was invited by a friend who asked me to hang out with him  It ended up that he didn't know where the event was  I show him the way and got a bit upset because I'm recently reclused from social media because I became to hate that world and had to defecate one important girl at the same time  There was things I didn't want to see or know in social media  So when we got there   he just hanged out with another ex rehability center guys and I was alone  I listened to Alice in chains and wondered why people tend to be happy and hug each other  I was ghost  I was drinking water and then I just threw the cup away with water and bailed in intense mood  I left for AA saturday night group but one of my AA friends noticed and followed me  Then we just chatted and laugh  We ordered pizza in group and I told everything   Hang in there  Just keep pursuing activities and habits that nurture you and continue to put yourself out there  The friends will come  I'm in a similar boat myself so I feel you  You can do this  Good vibes to you and a very happy new year   For the next couple of

flannel jammies   they're the BEST  that sounds so strange    why is your drinking so important to him   Have an appointment with my primary care provider Tuesday  I'm going to bring it up   I changed doctors in November  and had my first appointment with her in December  Tuesday's appointment is to follow up on bloodwork  and to probably lower my blood pressure medications   The ER doctor did suggest I bring up getting something stronger than SSRIs to deal with my anxiety  tried them before  didn't work well  couldn't take as needed  and the withdrawal sucks when you quit    Buspar seems to be something that someone with an addictive personality can take  it's not addictive  it's not a benzo  doesn't seem to have a high  and can be taken as needed  I'm going to discuss that with her  It's also on my insurance company's formulary as a generic   I felt completely normal when I woke up today   had 1mg ativan at the hospital  which is nothing for someone in WD  she wanted to see if it was a panic attack or full blown withdrawal before hitting me with a higher dose   which calmed me right the fuck down  She gave me a small script for librium  I took 2 last night  and felt completely fine when I woke up today   There's definitely some withdrawal going on   I've had 2 librium during the day  25mg each  last one was around 4pm   and a couple of beers a little while ago   I'm a little jittery  but nothing close to DT's  and got through a dinner shift just fine  If it was bad enough that I was going into DTs  I would have blown through the entire bottle of librium already   ER doc chalked it up to worrying myself into a severe panic attack  based on my response to a low dose of Ativan  calmed me right the fuck down and brought my blood pressure to sane levels  and it didn't go up in the  3 hours I was there  and my BAC at the time my blood was drawn  I don't have it on any paperwork handy  but she said it was pretty high    Plus said my liver numbers would have been a hell of a lot worse than they were if I was drinking enough to get into that kind of shape  I've had panic attacks before  but never one I couldn't recognize as a panic attack and manage to talk myself down from  But I'm prone to anxiety anyway  The official diagnosis on the discharge paperwork was general anxiety disorder  which I've been trying to get for years out of my primary care doctors  At least I have it on paper now  Woo  Made it through December 30th and 31st sober  on to 2017  I will not drink with any of you today   I was counting how many happy new years I got too then realized I hadn't sent any  time to give  Thanks so much    That's effectively what I want to  and you're right  I'm not going to get that by smoking  So thanks very much  Happy New Year   As in  you have days where you don't count calories  restrict  over exercise  purge  ect    The past couple of days  from christmas until right before today  I've found myself able to eat somewhat normal  No counting cals  over excerising  or having the urge to purge  It's slowly going back to my normal behavior but does anybody else ever get this  That's definitely a little harsh and inconsiderate  Congrats on 8 days Welcome u Fandeathrickets  Stopping drinking was one of the best decisions I ever made  Realising that I didn't ever have to feel like that again was liberating   Hope you're feeling better soon    I'll support this 100   Every time I've gotten past the first week and relapsed  it was some situation where the alcohol was right in front of me  and I ended up reaching out and grabbing it  Sometimes this was in the store  just decided to pick up a sixer while I was there  others it was at a party and I figured "fuck it" the second or third or whatever time saying no  or even friends who didn't understand inviting me to indulge a bit  One time was my 21st birthday and figuring I should take advantage  That was really fun because when I got home  I puked on the stairs and carpet and my mom made me clean it the hard way  right there and then  Somehow  it took me another year and 10 months to figure out that the first drink is the most important to forego  because weakness of will is always there  waiting for any opportunity  from a birthday  to a drunken insult  to a pretty girl  anything that will get us to take that first sip  It's good to be around friends  hurtful not to be invited  but ultimately  always a risk  in my experience  The most important thing I've learned in my life is that we should never assume that anybody else understands what is going on in our heads  As alcoholics  as people who suffer from depression  as men  or women  children  or adults  whoever you are  people will be different from you  and expecting them to fully understand is the only surefire way to get hurt by them  Since they are going to require you to attend AA anyway  why not check it out now  Better to want to go  make friends and learn how to stay sober than be forced to go and be miserable the whole time like I was  It's uncanny    Come into work a little still drunk  "boracha " Fuck  I haven't even said hola yet   Happy New Year and congratulations on your sober trip around the sun  Happy New Year everybody  I will not drink with you all today  Well i never was someone who sits hours before porn just the time to get off but i still saw the negative effects and stoped I'm so proud of you u throwsterrip  The 'firsts' can be tough  As u billbrasky87 said  it does get easier as sobriety becomes the norm   Congratulations on putting yourself first  Looking forward to seeing your "3" star  I have to agree with you  My mother  who abhors recreational drinking  offered me a bottle of chocolate red wine she got from a coworker  She couldn't drink if she wanted  and only approves of me drinking very moderately at holiday parties  And yet  she asked if I was sure when I turned the wine down  She's never been anything less than loving  People just don't understand feelings they've never experienced  so people who aren't alcoholics can't understand what it's like to be one  Expecting people to  for me  ironically led to most of my drinking  Drink moar  propose less   Marry the liquor  til death do ya part    What could go wrong   I would point out that a good friend to an alcoholic would feel like utter shit if that alcoholic friend relapsed at a party said former friend had hosted  I get your perspective  but you should try to see it from his too  That is quite funny   Happy New Year SB  Got stopped by cop  cop saw my friend had a shit ton of acid  Car gets searched and cop finds weed  Charges my friend with a felony and possession of marijuana  I just got charged with possession of marijuana  Basically a series of dumb decisions on my part got me busted  Good luck  Wish you all the best   I had my last joint on Thursday the  29th  Let's kick this habit together    The doctor didn't think it was severe withdrawal  and didn't note anything about alcohol on my discharge paperwork  only a panic attack  but did include some resources about rehab   Also  1mg of ativan calmed me right the fuck down  and kept me calm  whereas it usually takes at least 4 6mg for me if I've gotten into severe withdrawal  She did give me some librium to take home at least  When I asked how much ativan she had given me  she said only 1mg  to see if it calmed me down  1mg isn't enough someone close to DTs   and also said my blood pressure wasn't nearly high enough to be into withdrawal even before the ativan  and stayed low enough while there that she felt she could rule out anything close to DTs  I mentioned I'd felt like this for several days  she theorized that I've been so worried that I worried myself into a major panic attack  I'm prone to anxiety anyway  but I've never had a panic attack that bad  My blood pressure was also completely normal after 1mg   104 59 at discharge  which was a few hours after I got there  If I was as far into withdrawal as I thought I was  it would have been at least 160 within an hour of the initial dose  in my past experiences   I'm definitely jittery today  and my blood pressure is on the higher side   140 90  though I haven't taken my clonidine today   so there is SOME withdrawal going on  but don't feel like DTs  I've had 50mg of librium  one a bit after waking up  one around 4pm   which took the edge off  and this evening I had a few beers  but nowhere near my usual amount  If I was into bad withdrawal  I would have blown through the entire bottle already  she gave me 12 x 25mg   and suggested I talk to my PCP about something for anxiety stronger than an SSRI  and also consider naltrexone again to deal with the alcohol cravings   Typical at home detox I've had with librium has been 40 x 25mg over 10 days  with the first couple of days being very heavy and obviously no driving allowed until the last day or two   so the 50mg I've had today would have been nowhere near enough to get through even a few hours  I would have gone through most  if not all  of the bottle already if I was as far down the hole as I thought I was  Nice  Yeah  most of my friends slowed down in their mid twenties but I continued right along  I finally quit at 29 and now we do all sorts of stuff together  sometimes with them having a drink or two  sometimes not having anything  The outdoor stuff is great  In the last year one of my friends and I took up caving which has been awesome  and it's a good example of something I never would have been able to do back when I was drinking   Good for you  I was asleep well before midnight myself    Just spent a lovely evening watching the new Star Wars movie  No drinking for me  On the way home saw a wreck  One car smashed in the road and another on its side in someone's lawn  Cops were doing what looked like a sobriety test on a guy as I drove past  That could have been me on any one of hundreds of nights    Also  no drinking for me today either  Good night all   Thank you  and wishing you  and everyone here   one of the most amazing places I've ever been   a fantastic 2017 I got to a year one day at a time  I'm closing in on two  but that doesn't matter  What matters is today  and today I did not drink  I'll handle tomorrow when I get there  but today   today I did not drink  February for me   a support group might be helpful    once I get a car and can drive myself to appointments I'll look into the other options  I don't want to rely on my parents to drive me because they aren't reliable and they don't deal with me being treated well which can make things worse I went to a rehab facility for 28 days  One of the hardest things I've ever done  and out of my own choice  I see you have recently quit  congratulations  and keep it up  For the first month or two I used to be so hungry at night because of all the beer I drank  Also  add working out on top of that and I put away food  You get used to it  and great job       These are the tips I am seeking  Wishing a fantastic 2017 and every success to all of you  the most amazing and supportive place I've been    I will spend the first day of the new year being present for my family and not drinking   Happy New Year fellow sobies  May your 2017 be prosperous  wonderful  and rich in the fulfillment that sobriety brings  I would have hung out with you in Boulder    Yeah  But as you say on your original post  you want to do it for her  I'm just suggesting you don't lose sight of that    And FFS  The drinking age in America    Good on inpatient     That's really good news  Don't flake out  stick with it and good luck  So far I've had normal poops  a little loose but normal for how I've been lately  The last one was kinda dark but I wouldn't call it black tar at all  My stomach still isn't super happy with me but it isn't painful  just feels very irritated which could also be a result of my appetite declining a bit after the other night  No more vomit of any kind  especially not bloody   I'm 21  it's EXTREMELY difficult to just do anything in my town other than to drink and none of my friends believe I have a problem so they would obviously offer me and knowing myself I would probably accept  So yes  I know exactly what you're talking about  If someone simply gave me a cup of alcohol I would think twice and drink anyways so I just stay away from it all   Wow  Inspirational  Here's to a sober 17   Thank you    Ancient Mayan secrets  I will not drink with you   Husband's comments seem way out of line and best discussed when you're both sober  Going on day 3 having hard time sleeping due to nightmares im only doing gum to fight severe cravings  Any tips that got you through that you could share  Thanks bud  Hugs    It's the best thing you can do    It's been my experience drinking doesn't erase grief  it preserves it for future sober moments    The only efficient way to deal with this extraordinarily shitty emotion is to sit with it    Again hugs speechless bear hugs from an Internet stranger   me too  Hear here  man  Here's to another new year out of the chains    Made it home completely sober  Was poured a champagne shot at midnight  gave it to the person to my left  Glad I didn't drink tonight  Do you guys celebrate New Years in the UK or is that just an American thing  Yo I've smoked for 5 years and just quit 3 hours ago  Stay strong it's not easy but totally worth it   Agreed  they seemed to be on the caring side of this   38 days I dont think i would have been able to handle a nye party     My friends were pestering me yesterday to go to their NYE party and I used my sobriety as an excuse not to go as I knew it would be shit lol     23 days since my last relapse that lasted three days I was at fifty  I was using a g of hash oil a day  Apart from the drinking voices in my head   Happy new year  Good luck   Thank you  And Happy almost birthday to you   First sober one for 24 years for me  congratulations   It's scary right  Even the memory of that feeling scares me  Here's to a sober 2017  You're almost 90 days  That was a big one for me  Then the triple digits   one day at a time you'll get there   Thank you     Thank you for the support Thank you  So much bleach lol but it finally got there  Happy New Years   What happened to Mariah Carey  Thank you lady  Happy New Years to you and your family    You're not far behind     Mannnnnnn  I go to one of the top rated party schools in the country too  I live within a square mile of 24000  people  where only 20  of people claim not to drink compared to a national average of 44   The big difference with my hometown  Here  fewer people drink  more people abuse prescription drugs like benzodiazepines and opiates  there  they prefer booze  smoke even more weed  and seem to prefer amphetamines and psychedelics  Do I say no  The first time  definitely  the second time  maybe  if they keep offering    well damn  I don't even like drugs  but nothing beats free  right  In my experience  and even as a guy who tends to be able to sort of moderate his drinking  most people just can't understand  and so they do keep offering  They think it's weird  or you're just being polite  or you just had a bad experience one night  Some people just can't understand that bad experiences are  for some of us  a norm  Honestly my struggle with alcoholism has made me far more sympathetic to the prohibitionist movement Although  to be fair  a lot of my friends have ended up on psychiatric prescriptions  so I might just hang around fellow exceptionally fucked in the head people  I can't really say  but I do know our generation loves to drink and has a hard time understanding the few of us who disagree  I imagine it's similar for people of all ages though  different minds just work differently  have you ever been married  are you in some kind of rush   Thank you  I feel I've come so far  Yet so far to go  I know through sobriety all is possible  It's a wonderful feeling   We made it     they just generaly say pams are better than lams for whatever reason  im VEEEERY hungover from wine  cough with valium  cough   not smart rn   I quit on 15th November for good  No backsies  Yummy  I had macadamia chocolates from Hawaii and sparkling cider with my littles tonight  It was lovely  I'm so thankful to be here with them and wouldn't be anywhere else  Happy New Years to you and your family  I'm right there with you internet stranger  We've fucking got this  Congratulations on 365 days       Happy birthday to me  OH wow yeah  why didn't I think of that  BRILLIANT  Gonna pick me up some mask stuff tomorrow  That is awesome thanks  Congratulations    I envy you  What kind of support did you use to get where you are now  What do you continue to do to stay away  Sounds comfy  I don't know why but I love hotel stays  I have such an odd  and probably misplaced if you watch Dateline enough  sense of security when I stay at them  Happy NY  It does   Force yourself to eat something  drink water  take some acetaminophen   Bath or hot shower if you can  is it your birthday or clean day  or both  7 for me   Slept through new year's and I feel great  Awesome feat on this 'typical' day  just add another one  Nothing going on  just typical  no big deal and before you know you got another one under your belt  I will not drink with you today  How are you liking GOT  I'm a book fan  so my views of the show are biased but I did love the first season so much   I like that you're an old soul and you know it  Happy NYs to you  Yeah  true that    For the past 2 summers my life has been hard as hell  with it being record heat temps and all  and me not even able to wear shorts  This summer I seriously want to go to the pool every day  We have this huge pool in our apartment complex  It's so nice  And I have never used it  I HATE walking by the pool every day to check my mail box and hearing everyone splashing around  This summer I'm going to live in the pool        Subscribed    Good for you man  100 a week I'll need a badge reset because of yesterday but I will not drink today  I'm in the exact same situation  I'm sorry  it sucks  Just know that someone out there understands what you're going through   A projected issue maybe  i started where you were 377 days ago  i won't drink with you today  good luck    STAY HYDRATED  and force some food down  you can  you just don't want to    Melatonin for sleep    Thank you  this time last year I was getting ready to go for breakfast at a local pub  It was the day I bought my last beer at a bar    A therapist once told me  don't try to quit more than one thing at a time  He said that would be setting yourself up for failure   I have heard it said that we are only as sick as our secrets so I'm glad you got that off your chest and most importantly that you stayed sober   I am often reminded that what I used to mistake for boredom is really serenity  I was addicted to more than booze and cocaine  I was also addicted to adrenalin  trouble  drama  and out of whack risk taking   For the sleep  I did a couple of sleep studies  In my case it wasn't insomnia but what are called hypnogogic jerks where I get this jumpy  startled feeling right as I am falling asleep  It is very treatable and not so uncommon so I had a good outcome  My health is one of the only things where money is no object because  like sobriety  everything good in my life springs from my good health and sobriety   I used a program of recovery to help me replace my unhealthy self medicating with positive and healthy alternatives  I had a big hole in my soul that needed patching  This turned out not to be as impossible as I had once thought  I relapsed an awful lot  more than average by my reckoning   but sponsor a fellow  for over 20 years now   who stayed sober the very first try  He really wanted to be sober whereas I was the "principled skeptic"  a potentially dangerous personality type  but I made it despite myself  so far anyway      Thanks for sharing and helping me to stay sober for yet another day  Happy New Year   I will not drink today  Great moves OP  Doing the same thing in Australia at the moment  So it's been a little longer  We need to get our lives back  Your post has helped me get through the last part of the day  Thank you  Get ready for the funky dreams haha   I watch the sopranos and went to bed lol   Off to the driving range in a minute   Hi there  Congratulations on quitting   It sounds like you

 Read through this sub  sort by top  for invaluable tips and  most important to me  a sense of community that shows quitting marijuana isn't as easy as we all supposed  Today was cake  No big deal for

sobriety  Things are going well  I will not drink today  Jesus yeah  I wish all my friends would leave me the hell alone  I had to tell one of my buddies to not dare show up with booze around  If I

you  I won't drink with you today   OMG me too  I have just over 18 months clean now too  I was just telling my brother how cool it is to have a full calendar year clean  Congrats  Keep it up  Much love  We are rebels  Same  hope you just had a possession charge and not sales like me  It will only be  blemish on your record    Welcome   This is a fair question to ask and hard for anyone outside a professional or yourself to answer  For me  I knew I was an addict when I tried to stop drinking because of the problems it was causing me but found staying stopped to be very difficult  That is basically AA's step One   It turns out that for me I was self medicating  Alcohol was at first the perfect solution to treat my symptoms of social anxiety  feeling "less than"  feeling bored  and always needing some excitement and stimulation  It worked for a while and then just in the style of that movie  Bedazzled  I discovered a whole horrid downside to drinking and drugging that I thought only happened to  other  people   It took a lot of effort on my part to be relieved of my addictions  but today believe I am better off for having gone through that hell  yet I certainly would never recommend addiction as a self improvement tool    I was fortunate that I was able to draw a lot of good out of what was a lot of bad stuff   I hope you hang around here to learn more about your situation  I have been doing online sobriety since the days of dial up modems and bulletin board services  BBS  and I have found nothing better online than right here     Thank you  I will check out these links tomorrow  It's alot later than I thought it was  I fully appreciate the support  I've definitely puked my guts out   but I can't keep doing it just to prove something to that guy's dad Go to Urgent Care for an Ativan script  Just be honest with them about your issues  Dr  Is the way to go   Thank you for these inspiring words  I believe you when you say it does   Dogs Driving  just bought myself the car I've wanted for over 20 years  it's 16 years old and probably a really stupid purchase but I really want it  Guitars  but I need to teach myself to play again  Drawing Photography   Wooo sign me up   Thank you very much   Thank you very much  I will be posting on here  stay tuned      Goal setting is proven to be successful  Though its more than just saying you want to do  something  It's about creating a plan to achieve said goal   Anyways  awesome  stick to it man   Good luck You're fine dude   It was an accident and you had no desire or intention to smoke up   Be more careful next time    Also take notice of your feelings and thoughts around it  see how the brain can play with you in these situations  I would often get something like " Well you basically relapsed you might as well smoke for the rest of the day and quit tomorrow"     stay strong brutha  For the next couple of weeks   r cripplingalcoholism is participating in our yearly population

subreddit   message compose  to  r cripplingalcoholism  if you have any questions or concerns   You remind me of a fellow sobie I know whose father told him similar things  He also said never  trust a man who can't hold his liquor either  Four DUIs later  this person has made a complete about face  has years of sobriety  and now speaks at institutions for people who are trying to get sober to avoid jail  He has once again reattained his stature as an upstanding citizen and is a true gem in the collection of efforts made all over to help others to be spared the suffering he went through to not only get sober  but also enjoy being sober  I downloaded the reddit app just for this  i'll definitely be reading everyone's stories  Thank you for responding   Yay  Fantastic post  Thank you and wishing you another great year  Weed  No it's a major UK thing  My pleasure to help  Yes  the stories here are amazing as are the resources and the sense of fellowship  I wish this place existed when I was first considering sobriety  I hope to see you around     Me too  I was clear headed and enjoying my friends' company instead of in a fog and probably getting annoyed at stuff that doesn't matter   You know what   guess who will wake up with the worst hangover  feeling like the most shitty people on the planet    If they have a drop of conscience in them  they are gonna feel awful  evil and dumb  And probably have to drink all those horrible feelings away  So here's to you starting the new year sober and strong  and to them waking up feeling like horrible human beings     How vocal are you about your sobriety  I find other sober people insufferable when they constantly bring it up  I'm not in the same style of recovery as most of us here though  It puts me around more drinking than I was comfortable with at your number   Oh yeeeaaaaaah  Congratulations on your first soberversary  I am so pleased for you BadToTheTrombone  hugs and best wishes for a fantastic 2017 x Just keeping in mind that my future self will greatly appreciate it I suppose   I know jack shit about it  do you mean I can just show up and they will invite me to play for free   You and me both I did the same thing  except I don't have any friends   I came to a couple hours after midnight and realized it was the new year while taking a piss   Woo   Happy New Year   Cheers  fucker     Congrats  You've earned quite a good amount of valuable sober time and are a great testimony to those kicking around the idea of getting sober   Your words are very lucid and I agree wholeheartedly with the importance of ongoing work  One cool thing about sobriety is that I get to keep as long as I want it  and all I have to do to keep is to make it  1 in my life  I do that by "practicing these principles in all  my  affairs"  12th step paraphrase     I was told if I made sobriety  1  everything that came 2nd would come 1st class  I have not been disappointed  I have seen things come to pass in my sobriety that are nothing short of miraculous   Thanks for your powerful post this New Year's Day  Me too  It's weird   Been planning this day for 2 months  Telling my parents  my girlfriend  and my dog so that everyone holds me to it  Growing a pair and will look stupid if I can't follow through   Godspeed brother  What do you mean own choice   And since rehab what have you done   I'm an alcoholic addict with 7 yrs clean time btw  I felt the way you do for a long time   For me much of it was because I wasn't comfortable in most situations without a drink    Now days I don't care   and no one else seems to either  I  don't even tell folks that I don't drink  It's rarely relevant these days    Try to not let it bother you and don't overthink it   Checking in   Goodluck all  but lets have more than luck beside us  lets have the well  the plan  and the strength to achieve our similar goal   Happy new year everyone   Great work  as always    I know you're hearing a lot of bitching  but I didn't have a single problem taking the survey   Then again  I was sober  so    Checking in   so far so good for today  and i hope its the same for everyone else  goodluck   They don't sound like adults     I do the same    However it is such a sad feeling knowing that those thoughts are only "thoughts"  and not real  It looks super cute   Congratulations to all 13 victors    Special thanks for FBB and 419er  you both have been a motivation for me personally and obviously a true example of success  keep it up    With people who already know you  yes  some will be weirded out to see you go from drinking to not drinking  That's their problem  not yours  In my experience  most of the people who care have a questionable relationship with alcohol themselves    Nowadays  I find that it's so much easier to politely decline with a "No thanks  I'm good" than to explain I don't drink  For whatever reason  some people take my announcing that I don't drink to be a judgment against their partaking  or they might start to worry about whether or not they should drink in front of me  or wonder about what happened that led me to this place today  By not making an announceme that  I avoid all of that  That's why I find it easier to simply decline rather than explain  Maybe give that a try and see how it goes   I was thinking it wasn't effecting me too  After starting nofap pornfree I realized that is not the case  We get so used to those effects of porn on us  we usually don't even realize that it is affecting us  I am not saying this is the case for you  I don't know your situation  But it may be the case  So what you are doing is very nice  Like you said  if you are not addicted then It wouldn't be a problem quitting  so why not try       I wouldn't tell anyone in real life tbh  It is embarrassing  and people think that it is a normal thing to do  I just told my closest 2 friends that i am abstaining from porn and they respect it  but thats it  I didn't say that I am addicted etc  It's those unseen rewards that really bring a smile to the face  Ok I will get ahold of it  Thank you for the suggestion     Enjoy your time with your Gandma sober  man I miss mine   What did I do before  video games   17 year old   now 35  lol   so Great out doors these days  Love it  You make it sound like a cult     I mean  I can't think of any kind of housing that demands its location be a secret   Shit  Thanks for getting it out of your head  That's what smart  healthy  and successful sober people do    Would you believe that I now find myself in situations where  nonalcoholic  people feel awkward for drinking in my presence and sometimes even ask my permission  typically in my own home   So the social discomfort has done a total reversal where now it is those that drink that appear to experience the discomfort  Of course  It is not my intention to make anyone feel uncomfortable doing what they want to do within reason  It is just who I keep company with these days and probably has something to do with how long I've been away from drinking  and being older too  I rarely if ever feel awkward  OK  there was that time when eating dinner at the top of the Eiffel Tower a few years back   If anything  I actually feel respected  sometimes even  dare I say  admired     This is so great  I'm so pleased for you JungFu   Congratulations on this awesome milestone  you look amazing   I've got three lovelys myself and although it's not all rainbows and lollipops  sober parenting rocks   Here's to a fantastic 2017 to you and your family  many hugs x Good to see your back at it buddy  Life can be pretty sweet with no booze in it  No hang overs  no fuckups  no offending people  well   you get smart about it  drive when ever  weight lose  save coin  reliable  Goes on  Welcome back    tomorrow is the one day of the year you can call out from work  regardless of occupation  and no consequences can be leveled upon you   This a joke  Best feeling knowing you'll be fine driving   Checking in  ready to start another month  Lessons learnt mate  Sounds like you know the plan  Hope your feeling well soon  No court sanction or intervention necessary  That's what I mean by own choice   I've been working and hiding out from the general festivities  I'm going to meetings  keeping to a schedule and doing exercise   Congrats on 7 years  That's awesome  Ahh that feeling  Checking in  good luck everyone  I don't plan or wish to smoke  my cravings are almost non existent   I was just scared for my brain chemistry  because my first month of withdrawal

While I didn't see 2016 completely sober I did manage a few stints   Here's to a sober 2017   I will not drink today     Best wishes to all fellow sobernauts  Wow  I've been reading a lot of inspiring stories to get me through the past couple of days  and yours is the one that has hit me the most powerfully  Congratulations on one year and thank you for sharing how much your life has changed  Your

everybody  Quit on the 31st  Walked into a bar late enough  like 9pm  and just couldn't stand what I saw  Went home straight away  never returned   But I might be ahead of you   usually on the Swedish time  currently on the Irish   Awesome work  fucking awesome move and attitude Hero  Thats what you are   Congratulations  Here's to a healthy future   Happy New Year SD   my warmest wishes to all of

this  Hopefully that number goes up this year   Strength  You're worth it  95 days to go  To beat the odds  I will do it  I will do it so friging bad  Thank you for hosting and Happy New Year  What a great start to 2017  I woke up at 6 30am and ran 5k  I am very pleased with myself  Just sat here listening to Bill Burr podcast and about to make an omelette  Have a healthy and prosperous 2017 people  I will not drink today  First sober New year's that I can remember  I will not drink today   If I was a wrestler this would be my slogan   Awesome work mate  Breaking bad habits can be tough  I'm back on the grind of quitting  longest 18 months   slipped into bad habits and it's game over for alcohol  Things that got me by in the past  Gym  cardio  kickboxing  sarspiralla  ginger beer  having a 'tug'  swimming  sauna  pushups challenges   Life can be boring  but just remember why you quit and how fucked up it could be with alcohol   Oh yeah  Of course it'll do the job  but fuck me running off it just doesn't taste the worst  And I'll neck popov   Free booze is free booze though  My experience is my most valuable asset  What is my experience anyways  It is a collection of all my mistakes  With that said  I am a highly experienced person      A sponsor I had a while back  who ended up being like that great Zen master  Yoda type teacher and mentor  used to tell me  "The closest we come to perfection is that we identify our mistakes and we correct them  That's what successful people do " So that is what I have tried to do ever since   With some time  I became quite adept at handling such situations and with a lot of time  I find that most of those awkward situations just go away on their own or don't manifest to begin with  In fact  I'll go as far as to say the tables have largely turned and at most of the social gatherings I attend or host  it is now the drinker that sometimes appears to be in the awkward situation  I'm never judgmental or critical as there's nothing worse than a reformed drinker openly spouting his hatred of alcohol in front of guests  I've experienced a modicum of success in my sober life so I think some of the people I meet make the association of not drinking with success in life  In my case  they would be 100  right       So glad to be sober this morning   Yup  I think I passed out around 9pm  Just woke up  5am here   Made fish and chips  Watching a crime documentary  Drinking Jim Beam  Happy New Year  How does that happen  Just a test  sounds like your passing it   The amount of times I had to walk drunk on new years    but hey  we can all drive now  Pushups  get into'em and blow off some steam  Life is getting pretty sweet at 14 days there mate   oh  i used to do that too   Antibiotics and alcohol   oh dear   Fingers crossed recovery time is a lot faster    New year  clean slate  I intend to finish this year the way I started  I will not drink today  Wow  you runners are nuts  Goals man  impressive  Stick with it man  Those pancakes sound fantastic   Thanks  and happy new year  Ain't it just the best   Chef called me awake at 1530 to remind me that I'm a bit late for nye service   Back home  Alone  And drinking   So edgy and Badass  Congratulations    So proud of you    I've been looking at doing yoga for a while   a little while back I decided on Hatha yoga   I wanted something that would help de stress me and help with anxiety  That's on my to do list now    I will not drink with you today   Did 60 days last year then thought I could be a" social drinker"     Happy New Year  I will not drink today  lol there are some sober people down under    Hello mate  fellow limey here  Good to have you with us  Taking a month off it a good way to reassess your relationship with alcohol and have a think about what it means to you  What's the plan to stay on track  Well done on the 32 days by the way  a sober Christmas is no mean feat   So they finally posted my bloodwork online  They did a lot of shit  more than I'm used to  Stuff like pancreas function  Some specific tests you order for people with a history of alcoholism  and also a couple of tests to make sure the chest pain  which felt like a gorilla sitting on me  wasn't caused by heart issues  Xray was normal  blood showed no signs of a possible stroke or heart attack  Sodium was low  which explains all the muscle aches and cramping I had for the days leading up to this  Looking back  I can say I definitely mistook the tenseness for the early signs of DTs  as I tend to start shaking really bad and all of my muscles get really tense before it gets really bad   I'm sore as hell today  but feel more alive than I have in a long time   One liver count was elevated   38  normal is 8 20  I've seen my bloodwork after being treated for bad DTs  my AST was in the hundreds before  She said based on how much I said I drink  and how much alcohol she could smell on me at the time  that she expected far worse   So yeah     bloodwork  at least  shows I wasn't in anything resembling DTs or severe withdrawal  And I wasn't shaking uncontrollably at any point this time  My hands have been shaky since I got out  but not badly   I'm absolutely going to work on a plan with my doctor to get me on something to help with the cravings  probably naltrexone  which I've had good luck with in the past   get something for anxiety  and start attending AA again  Anxiety is absolutely the main reason I drink these days  and as tolerance builds from drinking every day  it turns into a physical addiction again  I'm also going to look into outpatient rehab again  I've done a 30 day once  and an outpatient 90 day once    I know I'm getting too old to keep going like this  I'm ready to quit for good   tl dr bloodwork  ER doc  and looking back at it today  ER doc is right  it was a severe panic attack   I'm really glad it wasn't DTs  and given how much I had been drinking over the past week  I'm surprised it wasn't  Going to talk to doctor about getting back on naltrexone  hopefully get anxiety meds that aren't SSRIs  preferably not benzos  but I'll do benzos if I have to   I'm not much on pills  but I do have a history of coke and meth addiction in my early 20s  alcoholism since I quit everything except alcohol and very occasional weed   don't even touch caffeine   Drinking these days is for anxiety  not to get drunk  I don't know if you have insurance  but Gabapentin and Lorazepam helped me with my spasms   Hope today is better for you  Congratulations  Loose weight  around 15kg in 12 months  get fit again and attempting vegetarian   but after tonight's dinner  was disappointing  Lol Good to have you here u Adders80  let's do 2017 clear and sober  Wonderful post  Good on you   There are lots of options to get support    12 step and SMART recovery are the options I can suggest checking out  The health system may also have options available to you    For me there was a long journey to recognize that I used against my will  Even longer to realise I'd hurt so many people that cared about me    I'm guessing you've tried to stay stopped previously  I won't drink today  Thanks for everything at the end of last year SD   I look forward to spending 2017 with you too   The sea is 2 minutes from my door  I should swim more  Yo that rhymed as well  it's a sign Two shots within half an hour   Love this   Edit  and your username   Great to have you with us  Maybe its a sign you should drop the dopest rap album of 2017  Good to hear you are going well   It helps to hear from those a little further along    'Never trust a man who doesn't drink'   heard that a few times  being Aussie 'what's wrong with ya'   ah man  same reason I don't do meth  not a fan mate   Saying you have become a 'whole' person is where it all lies    life will always have ups and downs  living sober is about embracing the balance you bring into your life  Embracing those ups and downs  We can't all be happy all of the time  but we can handle what comes our way as well as possible when we are sober   Congratulations  Be alcohol free  upgrade my alfresco area  go to an accountant and get a financial plan made  possible property investment  keep lifting weights  be a good mum  be a good wife  And yours   I often build things up in my head  If I think about something too long ill talk myself out of it  I am glad went to a meeting without thinking about it too long  Good luck  Mine was sleeping   I haven't slept well in 20 years of being a piss head on a daily basis Awesome  It's 2 30 am  I'm in bed after working a 14 hour shift  I'm getting up in 7 hours to run 2 5 miles around a lake and then jump in it     I'm excited  I've never done this before   I vow that 2017 will be full of Never Done Befores     Sounds pretty close to a drunk new year's    Remember that you're doing this for you  And happy new year    Soon  everything about your life WILL be different  Recovery is a complete lifestyle change  x Checking in A Happy new year everyone  With new year comes new opportunities and new chances Let's hold on to those chances and kick porn out of our systems forever   Good luck everyone True  SSRIs are known to be extremely finicky   Frankly  our neuroscience is in its primitive stages   I'm someone who tried three SSRIs with no discernible effect at all  positive or negative   And then the fourth one changed my life     My advice has to be that you shouldn't necessarily expect much from an SSRI  but they're definitely worth a try if your condition warrants it  Ooooo   Look at Mr  Fancypants over here  Able to pass out   Bah  Just don't follow through  I'm 28 and about to go through my second divorce  Whoops  Ughhh  You're back here and that shows a lot x It's so damn hard to be in an environment where people are drinking in the early stages  I thought I could do it   I failed   again   and again   I had to put myself in lock down or avoid situations as best I can for the moment until I get a bit stronger and it makes things even harder when people around you are not supportive at all   "It bloody is to me  I'm done  No more socialising with people who can't respect my boundaries "   well said  Keep fighting  You can do this x  Congrats on 365  Checking in  Good luck everyone  I messed up right at the end of 2016 when my girlfriend took a break  Won't happen in 2017  Welcome  it's good to have you here  I'm 29f  careful with diet and since I stopped drinking I have got into great shape and can eat more of the yummy stuff  This is such a positive change  I suggest reading This Naked Mind free on the side bar  Written by a women  completely mind changing  Definitely re setting your brain for habits like stopping for a bottle on the way home or rewarding yourself with alcohol or consoling yourself when stressed  I found it took about a month for that to start changing but I kept picking up on what my mind was doing so it was helpful  Have a fantastic start to 2017 I don't remember if I took the survey or not  That's cool buddy  everyone has a different experience with it  and I'm glad it helps you  Personally  when I smoke it daily I just get lethargic and down so I'm the opposite really  Plus joints are rolled with tobacco here and that's been my downfall twice already  So I'm giving the triple whammy a try this time    Best of luck to you and wishing you a great 2017  Check in time Stay strong everyone  it's time to go monster hunting   May the odds ever be in your favor   Nice  Drinking isn't going to help bud  well maybe the detox  but realistically it's time to face up to the SHORT term consequences   The Detox  It sucks  drink heaps of water  some sugary drinks  showers  panadole  gatorade  go for a walk and think to yourself what you have to loose  It's only a few days of shit to go through  it DOES end  The shakes will go  the nausea no more  sleep will get better  mood will feel so much better  Still strugglng  see a GP and they can help  But man  how much better of a husband and father will you be   You'll be admired  respected and even envied   Find a job and get my own place I dont like living with people anymore I want my own space Anything of note come out of it  Happy 2017 to you too   I have had many dry Januarys in a row and the key for me was just keeping the focus on the next 24 hours  you know  stay in the moment  My plan  like yours  is to stay sober for good  Nothing wrong with planning  I put it in my digital calendar and then forget about anything I have to do beyond today until that day comes  It actually helps me focus on today   In early sobriety  I was diagnosed with almost everything in the book  including bipolar formerly known as  manic depressive   it seems and was medicated accordingly  In my case  with time  the doctors' diagnoses changed and gradually  I got a clean bill of health  both body and mind  The key for me is that I don't play doctor  If I need to see one  then I do it  that simple  Then I will be a responsible and active patient  including questions  feedback  and 2nd opinions if necessary  My health is the LAST thing that I will skimp on costs with   Yep agree I've had this reaction but I just say I'm so happy to not be drinking and I'm so much happier being alcohol free  That makes it a positive and I've found when I say it like that the reaction is much better  And how can you argue with someone being happy     Yay   Happy for you a big NDV I'm with you too  sign me up please  thanks    What an achievement  Well done     This    I will not drink today  Does that mean we get to blow up a moon sized space station  I wanna use the force  D Comfy pj's   bliss good job HappyPillmore    Congratulations all of you   Can't wait to see my name on the list in 2017   2018  Checking in   Not much to report at the moment I cant answer for you but I will say it sounds like you might be picking up on something early which is fantastic  There's a book free from the side bar called This Naked Mind  I think it might really help you  it helped me  All the best  Hate it when my phone goes flat out   owned the park  Lol   This is why we don't drink  what a cool night  Sign me up  please and thank you Not drinking is working out pretty well for me  so I'm going to keep up with that    I'm going to work on figuring out what I want to do job wise  I like my job enough  but I think this year may be bringing changes whether I like it or not  Healthy eating and working out are high on the list too   Checking in  thus far everything is normal  I feel the pain your having right now  This sucks  Take some time to yourself to do the things you enjoy that aren't drinking  Like go for a  walk in nature or something    I could help   Good on you   Honestly I was feeling so strong  Until the pressure was on and then I was afraid I'd offend the host  How stupid is that  My sobriety is important to me BUT I'm a people pleaser codependent and always put myself last  Not again  My New Years resolution is to take better care of my needs REGARDLESS of how others feel  without hurting people of course   I am slightly miffed that SO threw me under the bus with the driving thing as I felt sabotaged BUT in the end the responsibility is mine alone  X Excellent distinction  once it's inside me I lose control of it  so best keep it outside   I would reply 'well I like me better when I'm sober'  Sorry you had to hear that  it must have been very hurtful  I think sometimes when we stop the remaining drinkers believe then that their own drinking will be called into question  I have been guilty on nights out wishing one non drinker would be drinking too because as they are sober they will remember everything  I have said and done  Seems stupid now but yes  I was projecting that they might notice what a heavy drinker I really was   I'm on a different sober forum for years and while I was single myself as I met my partner during a sober period  I know many marriages from others on there have hit hard times when one stops  It brings a clarity with it from our side too and relationship problems can suddenly come to the fore  Awesome news  I'm 4 weeks deep and it's good to see some light at end of tunnel    P s how do you get the number of days next to your name  Thanks   You put yourself and your sobriety first and that is awesome  A lot of the time people aren't really having as much fun as it looks on social media  I know I was so much happier at home sober than bringing in the new year in the city because every time I drank it was like rolling the dice  Would this night be ok or would I black out and cause myself drama  I would rather be a nana in bed at 9 30pm than roll that dice   Thanks Sophiestar79   Life feels different in 2017  Good  I think   Yeah  It happens to me periodically  but it's usually followed by periods of more intense dieting self hatred   Sign me up       I'm really not announcing it  and maybe this is reflective of the people in my life  but I tend to get asked what my favorite drink is  or what I'm drinking this weekend  or it gets strongly suggested to me to drink  "No  but thanks" works for the last one unless they push  and it's my go to  Maybe alcohol is just that pervasive in American culture  I will not drink today  Did not drink this Christmas or NYE thanks to this sub   Congrats twin year bro sister   It's great feeling this way  Hold your horses Lee  thanks to the leap year I've still got 13 hours to go     D   Thank you  Thank you  If ever there's motivation to quit that might be it  Sounds frustrating and also sad for you  I come from the complete opposite with straight parents and grandparents  never been drunk  Not sure what happened with me    happy to not drink with you today  HNY HP  Sounds rough but it also sounds like you're learning from it    I find driving is a great excuse when I'm not sure of how things might turn out  so maybe you could drive more often  and even dress it up as a benefit for your SO   Great job  and I'm glad you had a good time  I feel really optimistic about the new year also  peace and happiness to you too  Sounds like he's projecting his own insecurities on you  I've had that many times with work friends  I went to a work party one year when I stopped drinking for some time  the 'cool' guy later after drinking 8 of his 10 pack cans of Jim Beam said to me 'How did you do it  I hate this and want to quit too'   People love to see others fail  makes them feel better    Keep at it  Go for it  It's not stupid at all  I don't think the host was being very respectful to be honest  No is no    It's easy to say in hindsight   I'm a people please myself and it's something I'm working on as my health  sobriety depends on handling situations just like this  It's fucking hard  From it though it sounds like you've learnt more about yourself and what doesn't work  you can take that away from it x If you can look forward and be kind to yourself  Its the start of a new year  A fresh start    I wont drink with you today x That's rough  two really awful infections  Sorry you're going through this  Might lag to get your immunity levels checked  Hope you're feeling much better soon Bro  people would do this shit when I drank  And people would do this when I quit    Guess what  They weren't my friends   That's half the advice I'm ganna give   The other half is some people just don't know how to deal with you being sober  If they are your friend  worth keeping  they may just need time to adjust to the new you  your new lifestyle  It sounds like he was trying to be considerate but just fucked up  So it's good you told him how you feel  He know how you feel  Give him a day to sit on it  Bring it up later  Or maybe go out to a smaller setting with alcohol and show him you don't need alcohol  New Years parties tend to be pretty off the hook  I wouldn't want to go out with my best friend to some New Years party    Not everyone is like me  but as an adult  i hate Halloween now because it was a great holiday to go out and drink  New Years is much the same now  I spend it with my family instead of friends   Stop smoking  I stupidly started again after 11 months off them and the booze  With one came the other  I was running half marathons a year ago  would like to get back to that if my bad back would permit me to     On that note  do my physio exercises every day    Cut back on meat  I've been trying a vegetarian diet and while it's been ok so far  I'm not putting any pressure on myself to keep it up  cutting back long term would suffice  You're lucky no one cared  at a party the other night I had people questioning me on my drinking choices and others questioning me on theirs    I'm sorry you're hurting    My wife wasn't too thrilled about my alcoholism and said something similar when I first bought it up      I continued drinking for 7 more years    In hindsight  I had bought it up at a bad time and in a bad context    I also had not explained to her how bad it was getting     When I finally broached the subject again  I came clean with her about how much I was drinking  the fact that I could not stop  and that I was feeling suicidal       It was still a bit of a shock for her as I had hidden my alcoholism well    But she came around quickly and is very supportive now       All the best to you   Hey there HP   Happy New Year to you my friend  many hugs x You start by getting on the horse and focus on the day at hand and continue one day at a time  I'm having a giggle   ice box   shoe box   I'm sure they look similar if you were drunk      Who know what else you might find and where  Happy New Year     I will not drink today  Thank you  This probably isn't what you were thinking but putting shoes in the freezers gets rid of shoe odor  the cold kills the bacteria   Your description of anxiety  piecing together the black out and racing heart is such a good description I 100  know this feeling  Welcome  It's a great feeling to know you will never have to feel that horrible hangover   black out   alcohol induced anxiety ever again  Sometimes we need things to happen for us to realise things need to change  All the best  I won't drink with you today Congrats Josephine  it's crazy what a difference a year can make  Happy 2017  Me too  good luck to us both  My girlfriend does the same thing   I'm glad you are getting  counseling  work closely with her him   With respect to your question of whether you 'passed the point of return'  I really don't think there is such a place time   We always have it within us to turn around   To do good   To loved    To be loved   Stay strong  checking the cock monkey in  ready to live life in 2017  best luck all Good for you      The bad feelings will pass    I honestly can't remember more than a handful of NYE's in my 46 years    I was always smashed      And the ones I do remember we're because something bad happened     You really didn't miss much     Way to go      I caved in and had 4 drinks on new years eve over a period of 7 hours  The whole time i didn't enjoy it and even poured the last one out  Cliche  but i'm done with booze new years day  it's all out of the house  start a new job tomorrow and i'm excited  There's only a few things in life 'you just know'  this is one of them   I've requested to have my badge commenced today  Wooohooooooooooo  Hang in  only one slip with a lot of triggers present  No hate the self  hate the addiction  congrats on taking the challenge Congrats man I play to have a year just like you   So far so good went into the new year didn't drink and am not hungover I feel amazing for the first new year in almost a decade  Best of luck bro   Congrats  it's nice reading that  Congratulations to all of you   Congrats all  nearly slipped but managed to stay off the porn machine  I masturbated about three time  twice last week  Hopefully  this won't lead to a relapse  One day at a time  Does does your boyfriend know about your recovery   If he doesn't  clue him in  A good partner should always make you feel like the sexiest person on earth  especially when you're naked  Sign me up  Sign me up  With you all too guys   this shit has ruled my life for the last 12 years  A week strong atm  good luck to all    first month is the shittest    No porn   Reading your post triggered me to PJO  Pancakes  Jam  Orgasm       Sell them on ebay for slightly less than their value 1 No problem  You see  everyone is different  Even when we are addicted  no two people are addicted in the same way or for the same reasons  If I had to try and pinpoint it  I would say my addiction stems from a real world lack of confidence in my social skills and my image  I have massive anxiety working with people or being in a classroom  etc  Those issues are very difficult to fix  and being in my mid 20's doesn't really help  So what helps me feel better  Gaming  Load up any Blizzard game and enter the world of make believe and all your problems temporarily go away  until you log off  Then reality hits  which is scary  so it's time to run right back to video games because these feelings suck and we don't want to deal with them right now   It's pretty much escapism 101  I usually can't even sleep anymore without watching Twitch  This is because when you lay down and try to sleep  your mind becomes clear and you think about real life  If your intentions are to avoid the negative feelings associated with your real world issues  then you essentially need to be drugged out all the time  through gaming  in order to get through even a simple task like sleeping  otherwise you will have insomnia    Some people are alcoholics  and some people are drug addicts  we happen to be game addicts  They are all very similar  If you solved your real issues  I'm confident gaming wouldn't have the same effect on you as it does now  Australia is pretty bad to mate  It's culture pretty much and some people as you said don't know any better  In the past when I quit i did announce it  was awkward as fuck every single time  So I changed my tune to giving my liver a break for a while  seems to work as 'these' people would often say 'haha  you gotta do that at times' or whatever and let it go  The fact that you say you do it out of boredom suggests that you need something else to do during times of boredom   Is that the pushups   Is it going for a drive   It might help to have a list of things that you will do any time boredom  and its accompanying urges  might set in     Good luck  It takes a while for people to get used to the sudden change in your regular behaviour  At least they thought about your situation and decided to be supportive  even if they got it wrong  They didn't make fun of you and pressure you into drinking  You are lucky to have such friends  No man is an island  You are in the victim stage of addiction depression it is the stage where you feel sorry for yourself  These are all my issues  how can I ever deal with them  At this point you can't go any lower without them putting you in the ground  Every day you told yourself not today  was a day closer to where you are now  Everyone on this board has done it  Most people in this world have done it  You're not special  Understand that this isn't unique to you   The escorts probably did it too  I wouldn't worry about them  They also have their own problems  maybe they were victims of themselves  of their situation  maybe they were saving up for a Holden  Who knows  Everyone deals with their issues differently and rarely do people respond to an extended hand to help them with their cool emotional problems   Sure  some women may judge you for the escorts  but they will understand that it happened in a low part of your life  They've done something in their past that helped them deal with the dark times  If they haven't they're either lying or they're so boring you don't want them anyway    Everyone has had a suicidal thought  Everyone  This is also not unique to you   What do you do now  You get help  either go to a doctor explain you're depressed and you might want to go the medical route with antidepressants or get yourself to a therapist  or someone to talk to you about this  professional would be better  probably     We can help keep you on track  But we aren't people in your life  I'm in NSW  so probably closer geographically to you than most on this subreddit  But what are we going to do for you  You're asking for help  make this your first step to actually doing something that helps you  Tomorrow is Monday this time next week would be your completion of a week  Or We will see you again January 1st 2018   Sorry to hear that  I know all to well the feeling of relapse   That you went 40 days tells me that you can go forever   But it does always start with day 1 and continues one day at a time from then   Focus on the day at hand and acknowledge today is not the day     You've got this  Way to go    You've got this  and enjoy the pancakes  Day 2 again  This is my time now  I sure hope so  It's been a rubbish last 3 years of addiction  Peace  Good going  The enhanced perception of the aroma of booze is a thing for me too  My wife will occasionally  like maybe three times a year  have a vodka or three and I can smell it when I walk in the door as I get home from work  Keep it going man    Not drinking today happy new year SD  Get right back on the horse   You've got this  Yeeehaaa  Happy new year  Good choice  I found last night tough and found myself having feelings of regret about staying in  However  NYE last year was the moment I decided I seriously had to change my relationship with alcohol at the very least  and abstain totally ideally  So the very fact that a year on from that moment I chose  despite my great desire to go out  to stay in and stay sober is evidence of how much I have grown in 2016   thanks to all of you    I will not drink today and I'm very  very happy about that   Happy new year  Stay strong  focus on today   Can you commit to staying  free today   Try taking this one day at a time   You've got this  I hate those comments   like alcohol made me a better person  It's bullshit and I have refused to accept those comments and generally say something along the lines of 'No alcohol did not make me more fun because it wasn't me   Hang in there not everyone gets it  I won't be drinking tonight  I have so many triggers  but beer may be the biggest of them  GL  Do you need to tell your girlfriend because you've spoken of this in the past and this is part of an agreement you made   If so  I commend you on your honesty   You had made it 2 months which says you have it in you to keep going   To never stop   One day at a time  sir   one day at a time  I'm in  Time to make a change  One day at a time  you've got this  Yay  congrats      I got through my first day myself with surprisingly little issue  I was even offered a free bottle of wine  and graciously turned it down   Go us   D Happy New Year  Good luck  you've got this  Music  I used to breathe music and worked as a sound engineer  Alcohol almost killed my love of music  it came to a point when for a few years I barely listened to anything  That love came back big time when I stopped drinking  what a waste  Checking in  so true  it's the only time I see family and being the drunkard  I get my name thrown around whenever there is alcohol involved   one day I'll be a hermit and die alone Congrats on the 42 days   You've shown you've got it in you to beat those urges   So stay strong  you've got this  I'm sorry you're suffering     It's tough in the early days but it gets so much easier      Wishing you all the best    Gaming has consumed me to the point where I no longer do it as a social hobby with some friends  but I instead use it as a way to run from every single problem that arises in my life to the point where I become completely dependent on the feeling of gaming in order to get me through the day  It's no different than being an alcoholic or a drug addict   I played Overwatch for about 14 hours a day   The motivation  I want to live a normal life again  Awesome  Congratulations on a year  and happy 2017  Maybe it's because of the new year  but at 6 months I feel ready for a new beginning  It's inspiring to see how happy you are now despite not everything being perfect  Thanks for sharing  and thanks for the Gonzo flash from the past  Glad you're here   Your support is welcomed and be sure we offer it in return   Welcome and good luck  This is exactly how I felt this NYE  It sucks and i'm STILL not happy about it but I know that I made the right decision    AND because I made the right decision that was also the more difficult decision I feel like a real adult  Look at all this willpower I have  mere mortals  I'm proud of myself despite how much FOMO I'm experiencing  the FOMO will fade but I'm quite sure the pride will have a lasting effect on my opinion of myself and what I'm capable of    Congratulations on flexing your willpower muscle and staying strong   What a beautiful FACE in your star    Congratulations  on not drinking last night  and 1 year  Serious advice  Maybe give up gum as well  Just a thought though   I agree with Lamp's comment   You've got what it takes   One day at a time  It's good that you recognise vulnerable times  like being tired  so learn from this and keep going  I went out and had fun  Went home after midnight because the drunks were getting sloppy and annoying   Hey  me too    Good luck  Direbrain  and  u coldbeers Thank you  I think 6 months is what it took me to realize I was over recovering and it was time to make some new moves  I wasn't worried anymore  Congrats on your 6 months  I really don't miss embarrassing stuff Ive done drunk  And belive me I cant remember most of them but I do have a suitcase full of those scenes  Welcome and I wont drink with you today  I not only already pee n someones bed while wasted but woke up in my exs pee  Well I cant unpee what Ive pee on  But sure can prevent myself of not doing again  Been lurking for a few weeks  realised I have a problem with alcohol that's been with me since my teens  about 25 years ago  This is my first comment and day one of stopping drinking  I will not drink with you all today  What do you mean by feeling like garbage  Is it the cravings or something else  Sign me up    I remember this day last year because it was the day I tried to quit drinking  I quit for 30 days and then started again in February and quit for good in July  I'm looking forward to celebrating a year of sobriety this year  I'm staying sober today   Sign me up    Sign me up We got this  2 days in   Must be honost  doesn't feel good atm  but I know it will get better in a few days  And here we are on January 1   Day one of the year   I'm looking at my badge that has '28' on it   That's nice  I'm working on it   I look at those whose badges read 280  and that's nice  too  they're working on it   Similarly  I'm seeing people with badges that say "1"  They  too are working on it   But for each of us  it's not the past that dictates our future success   Sure  a successful past may lead to confidence in what we do today and in the future   But ultimately  it's what we do today  what we do now  that defines us moving forward   So  let's take a look whatever our badge numbers  large or small  tell us   But that's not where our success lies   It's with what we do in the future   But that future begins now   It begins today   And you know what   I can tackle that   Not today   Happy 2017  Awesome  congrats on a year  Checking in  F   yeah      Happy first day of 2017 to all SD   First day of new years that I wake up sober n full of energy in seventeen years  Time to catch up    checking in  Checking in  Not drinking w you all today   Checking in  Happy new year  Checking in  This is my first ever challenge  Here's to a strong 2017  Happy to share that I also had a lovely time NOT drinking at a NYE party  Better time in fact that I would have had if I was drinking  Clear headed  able to converse without slurring and not being the drunk chick of my past sells  was fabulous    I was just scared and mad at my gf that I delayed my path to homeostasis   Also  when I was in a room where people smoked the spliff  I lit up a cigarette and held it in front of my nose  Made it    Will not drink today  Try giving them a call  410 663 1922    I'm sure whoever is handling the hotline tonight will be able to help you  As it is almost 7 AM where you are  there will be meetings starting at any time now    Good luck and I hope you find some inner peace   I'm upvoting this as hard as I fucking can  Thank you    You know it   Happy New Year    Not Drinking today I'm the same way  I love staying in hotels  It's like an adventure    I always watch dateline too lol   Thank you   Thanks  I don't crave a drink at all  but I wasn't prepared how much this physically hurts  Hopefully it goes away soon I have some friends that even if i pushed away for a these two years or a year want to see me still contact me  I told my closest one my problems because I couldn't take it anymore  He was very supportive  Should I burden them  I feel like I want to be honest and not hide anymore  I've been hiding my whole life and that hasn't worked out for me  I'm thinking of just telling my closest ones I think I've always wanted too but couldn't and held back   Also is the victim stage a bad thing  I think I understand I have to now do something about it  I just feel a little hopeless still  Thanks for your help   Sounds like you know what you need to do  Get yourself a big bottle of water  some gatorade  some panadole  two minute noodles until you see your GP to get through the detox  When I was hung over going through that cycle I would watch youtube learning vids  DYI  shit i'm into and vlogs    that shit really helped me get through the first few days in the past  What's awesome about your post is  you know what you need to do  10 years of it  i did it for 17    sucks ass and you're lucky to be thinking so straight  Set some life goals and how you're going to get it done  Check out some vids on youtube for anxiety to help you  I found some to be helpful for my anxiety  'socially awkward' anxiety for me can be intense  but working on it    You got this  no more hang overs  take back your life  Check in here every day  vent  read and share   You got this  It's going to hurt but you can do it  just for today   Drinking won't help at all Checking in  this also is my first ever challenge so let's make this year a success    I'm spending about  90 per week for two eighths or one quarter  That's more than half my rent like what have i been thinking    Awesome and inspiring  Exactly this   I can drink but I don't want to   Not even a sip   I will not drink today  Happy New Year everyone Good morning  Happy New Year and I will not drink today  Update   I got busy  kissed my kids  worked out and feel much better   I am taking "mistake boredom for serenity" for future reference and  am smashing ginger ale like its going out of fashion but a good sarspiralla is tough to get in the UK   SD is a good place to be    Happy Birthday mate  Awesome work   hey never alone on the internet  Hang on  It won't always be this way     Have I passed the point of no return for me   Yes you're fucked  Sorry man   I'm kidding  As you are learning right now  recovery is a right bitch  We've all thought this at one point or another  and we all think our situation is uniquely different from others such that we'll be the first ones to never recover at all   There is no "point of no return" to be honest  Besides death anyway  Unless you're dead there is always a window of opportunity open to you to get past this   even if you can't always see that window    Recovery is multifaceted journey that will constantly challenge you  So if you've fallen from grace  reframe it as a necessary experience in your catalogue of experiences  Don't beat yourself up over your situation or every relapse  I mean  I know you will naturally  but try to minimise it  it's part of the addiction cycle

getting sober is one thing  keeping it up can be frigging hard  Nicely done   Happy New Year   Sounds like you want a change in your life   2017 is a great year for change  The other day I got up

great people at SD  could not have done it without YOU     The plan sounds awesome  Can't beat that feeling  Stick around  You can do this    I will not drink today   Happy to end 2016 and start 2017 sober  First few days are the hardest  IMO  Do whatever it takes to make it through  because you will crave  I'm proud of you for taking this first step   I'm not drinking with you today   Never propose coming out of a 15 year drinking binge  I'm nearing the end of that mistake  Seriously  get your shit together enough to not do that  You'll save yourself so many troubles  Thanks    I really  really  appreciate your reply    Checking in    still going strong  Awesome job guys  Way to do it   Let's go   all your problems temporarily go away  until you log off    Yes  so until my IRL offline problems are solved  I'll stop gaming   maybe I'll play again watch videos later when things are better   but you're right as of now it's just another  feel good  drug to replace the worries and problems I have     Thanks once again Checking in    not much to report  Good luck everyone  Indeed  it's an awesome holiday    And it was a race relations forum after the whole Jena 6 thing  A decade later it's mostly forgotten  but at the time it was a huge deal  https   en wikipedia org wiki Jena Six I definitely gave in to the sugar urge  Whew  Remember  in most countries  a proposal is not a legal issue marriage is  Much simpler and easier to walk away from a proposal than marriage    If you've got a taste for proposing  propose something else  Purpose you go pearl diving in the south

up not hungover this morning  and it feels great  I will definitely not be drinking today  day 5   Huh  did that yesterday  I've literally proposed three times in the past two weeks  And I'm not too visibly drunk apparantly  so I have to explain that shit away after   Hey man  sounds like a good conversation to have  Had one similiar with my wife  it's on my posts 'Binge Drinker'   So the afternoons are your worst  plan to do something else  go to the gym  swim  pushups  walk the dog  visit someone  work on a project  something different to break the time period of habit    Mind to bottle connection  think about what it has done to you and makes you feel  what it's taking away from you  it thinks your a pussy and is the boss   own it and pour it out in the sink  be the boss  Your mood will get better  maybe loose a couple kg  save some money  be reliable  a better husband  no more regrets   Uh  I've lived in confidential housing plenty of times  It's for safety reasons  I'm being intentionally vague because it's really not business that all of reddit needs to get nosy about    Just be glad you've never had to be in this situation    Great job coming back here   Happy New Year everybody  7 days in  Another goal hit    My sleep is starting to improve and I'm feeling real emotions again  I teared up at a movie last night  Good times    Here's to a sober 2017  I dont know why the fuck you are not proud of your 28  I'm loving me 21  My last record was 5 and it was done on vacation   with people in the house you know   28 rocks dude  I do this all the time     Drunk Jax wants to get married   have your babies and buy a house    Sober Jax just may think your kind of cute  Congrats on two weeks   I'm with you   as long as I don't take that first drink  I stay in control  It's wonderful that your husband is supportive    Smell of wine   oh my  yes it is strong  I have family visiting  about a month  they are great  and my brother likes to have a glass of red wine with dinner  I cannot believe how strong and unpleasant I find the smell  Thankfully  wine was never my alcohol of choice  so having it in the house is not a problem    Happy travels and happy new year  Yep I know that feeling  own space is so important  Some good goals there  go smash em  I went to bed at ten    And life is much better than good  We believe in you  Considering he was just at the ER    I don't think he needs to be told this  If they were going to rx him something  they would have then   sign me up  Resisted the urge to buy a new pack before the year ended last night  I'm totally done with them  My biggest struggle will be that most of my good friends and pretty much all of my coworkers are smokers so It'll be tough to resist  even tougher to get down off my high horse when I look back at what I've achieved in 2017  I will not drink today  Happy new years to all of you  I will not drink today  Welcome  The sidebar is full of helpful interesting reads  Honestly  this may sound silly and or may not work for you  but I have found that embracing the choice to not drink  today  has made sobriety a bit more manageable  That and reading here daily and making a plan of things I will do or drink instead of drink alcohol    I will not drink alcohol with you today  Instead it will be coffee  tea  and a bit of fizzy water   They do  but today it's only the new year in America  It's next week in the UK  they're on a different calendar   all the extra letters in words like colour and aluminium delay things a bit      Kinda like how Chinese new year isn't in American January either    Happy birthday and happy 36 days  Thanks for your response  Much appreciated  Not sure what you mean by 'side bar'   Keen to find and read This Naked Mind  Thanks again  I refuse to accept a beverage of any alcoholic strength or substance on this day  a day of new beginnings  Yuhuu  300 participants  Let's go guys  First night in over a month I did not PMO and I feel great already     Exactly   I just have to stay away from it next time  I'm sorry the end of the night was not celebratory    Welcome to the sub   Happy new year  It was a heavy trigger   luckily I have deleted all my games  permanent  so I wouldn't fall back to binge gaming again  checking in   lets go I'm in   Checking in Thanks  I was clean for most of 2016 but good to try and do a full year officially  In my opinion anyone who says that does not want their own drinking challenged   I know when I was drinking if I told my sober friend that it would have been exactly for that reason   I'm sorry to hear your husband is like that   My wife was not 100  on board the first week or two until we talked   And I mean talked   I told her I was not just slowing down  I was done    I explained the hidden caches  the secret extra drinking  the lying about how much  the bad decisions it had led me to   Then she got it and while she may still have a glass of wine she is very sensitive to my feelings and if I'm having a bad day she'll pass on drinking     So at for me  if my wife was drinking heavily I would not have made it this far   You spend way too much time with a spouse partner for that not to matter   Talking it thru in painful detail helped me   Good luck  I won't drink with you today  Happy new year  Woot  Way to ring in the new year Happy NY    I will not drink today   You've got this  Congratulations guys  Agreed  fellow awesome person  True   it's like if you've quit smoking but still smoke occasionally there's a big risk that you will relapse and start smoking again  Hey  I'm in  Sounds like you can moderate it so you're not nearly addicted and 3 hours a day isn't even a lot   checking in You made a strong decision coming back   I will not drink with you today  Sign me up please  Happy to be here on the first day of 2017 not drinking with all of you fine folks    u iDoneDo thanks for hosting the DCI this week and getting 2017 off to a strong start  Nice post  Happy for you and your kids  I know I'm late but I'd like to sign up please  Not drinking today  Not being alone one this journey has been a huge part of staying sober and building a life where sobriety just makes the most sense        Is La Croix the official beverage of choice  Many  many sobernauts swear by it  It probably should be the official beverage as much as it is talked about here   Terrific post  Congrats on your sober journey around the sun  Well said  Congrats on the year  Checking in  Thank you so much  Your response was helpful and supportive  and truly helped me when I was feeling alone and frustrated  I've definitely cooled off and think I'm in a better place emotionally  to handle this  I really appreciate your advice about how to frame the discussion so it's less about attacking him and more about how it affects me  Subscribed to the alanon subreddit as well  Thanks and happy new year    The victim stage of addiction is simply put the point at which you tell yourself I'm the worst  I can't do this  I don't want to go on  You basically think of yourself as a victim of yourself and your addiction  You likely blame others too  If you have a gf wife  you might tell yourself  she won't do this for me  she doesn't understand  I need this  It is also the stage which your addictions thrive  The drug that makes you claw at your skin  That porno telling you I will make you feel better  You are most susceptible to your impulses  The victim stage is only bad if you live in it  Which many do for years   You should tell people you trust  But remember if they make fun of you or judge you  they're only human  Some aren't going to believe it can even be addictive  Sex porn  especially porn  can be seen as a fake copout addiction    I know the feeling of denial and feeling like I'm hiding and being scared others will find out  Freaking out that I forget to clear my browsing history    Remember though addiction isn't cured  it is forgotten  The further you get away from it the less of a victim of addiction you are feel  You stop being an addict  But it is a lifetime of vigilance  you can start being an addict again with a single click  People on here and in life can go one year  two years  ten years and have a moment of weakness and binge  Basically be back to where they started    Have you thought of looking for sex porn addicts meetings support groups around Victoria  If you're looking for non medical  professional assistance    That's so kind of your husband to 'give' you the month of January   So then you can 'take' the months of February  March etc etc       People who love drinking don't like someone sober being around because it makes them feel uncomfortable  5 days sober after starting a Day 0 thread   I am feeling fanfuckingtastic   Best decision I've ever made  Thanks  you're definitely right  I don't think what I have to say will even make much of a difference  honestly  but I think it's important that I express where I'm at  Maybe some part of it will resonate  I'll have to look into local alanon meeting options for myself as well  Thanks for the thoughtful and kind response  I really appreciate your advice  Happy new year   I'm having very much the same thoughts  Just chiming in   The holidays seem to be a rough time  Congrats on not getting laid off  Sorry to hear about the 2 seizures though  that sucks a lot  Be careful bud  I hope it doesn't happen again  Just curious though is there any indication or warning for the seizure or do you just wake up out of it  I've had some nasty shakes sweating fear after bingeing and possibility of seizure is always in the back of my mind   I would spend around  30 a day  That gets you a good eighth in Maine  Funny enough  this state just legalized it and now I'm quitting  It's a funny thing about craving   I always said I didn't crave alcohol and "I could quit anytime "  Yet somehow at 6 pm every day a wine glass magically leapt from the cupboard to the counter and filled itself with wine   So while I said I didn't crave it  for over 10 years I never skipped it   I might skip a meal if feeling sickly  or talking to the family if I had a headache  but skip that glass and its 10 friends   Nope   What helped me at first other than my therapist was reading  posting and commenting like crazy here  reading This Naked Mind  and not saying no to ANY impulse other than drinking   Want to sleep at 8  Did it   Eat ice cream for dinner  Did it     You can do it   It sounds like you're being honest with yourself  that was my first step   Life gets so  so  so much better  fast   I will not drink with you today  I completely understand   I am so very angry at my alcoholic husband and what his addiction has done to our family  I hate it   I hate it   I hate it   I tried Alanon but I don't think I'll go back   The meeting I attended was full of very nice people who just kept going on about how you have to "fake it until you make it" regarding living with an alcoholic   In my opinion  that's what led to the disaster that is my life   Faking that everything is okay   Faking that he is not black out drunk   Faking that we are a happy family   Faking that he is not ignoring the children   Faking that he is a supportive partner   Maybe I misinterpreted the meeting   maybe I am totally off base  but I didn't like it   But   I understand your anger and if you just want to chat  you can PM me   I wish I could offer more   I do want to add that I am not criticizing Alanon   I absolutely know that it is very valuable and helpful to a heck of a lot of people   It just wasn't for me  Agreed  I've only finished day 1 and I'm already a miserable git  Me Nice  good suggestions  I love podcasts  will check them out   I am not drinking today  Same  Congrats Thank you for posting this  It gives me hope  Would look great  Sign me up please  Fantastic celebration list  Our NYE is always a happy day because we celebrate the year  my husband's birthday  and our wedding anniversary   There wasn't ice cream  but we did have cake   scratch angle food cake with whipped cream and a blueberry pure   so delicious  Try and view this "voice" as a the irritating lying ghost of your former addiction  And know and believe 100  that if you have one cigarette it will bring that addiction back some power  before you know it the asshole is back  This is more for the cravings and when you get passed one by someone  But do be aware that this is why you picked it back up before   Checking in  Happy and healthy wishes to you  I was alone and sober for NYE for the first time in decades  I was lonely and depressed  But I woke up sober and feel great about  We are close in our sober time and I struggled this weekend too  I was alone  it was a holiday and I had 3 days off  Prime drinking time  I'm glad you did not drink and I will not drink with you today  Happy New Year  It's In the info section for this sub it should be there sorry I'm not sure how to post a link directly but if you go to thisnakedmind com you should be able to download it for free at the moment   Happy New Year  Not drinking today  Will push through   I am not to sure but It might have something to do with how your lungs clean themselves after a month or so the coughing got pretty bad for me last time I quit  maybe do some googling on that  I guess I've been honest with myself for a long while now  It has literally been years since I admitted to myself that I don't have any control over alcohol  I guess I just need to be more honest with others around me   It feels so good to talk openly about what I'm thinking  I really appreciate the reply   this sub is  awesome   I will not drink with you too    I'm with you brother   Checking in  I'm also on day 1  Last night I took all my paraphernalia and threw it out  It really hurt because it cost me a lot of money but continuing to smoke weed everyday will cost me way more money in the long run    Like you said  I'm tired of being numb all the time  I also feel like I'm never truly happy anymore  I just live toke to toke  I need to get back my natural happiness because it shouldn't depend on a plant  Happy New Year  I did not give in to drinking last night and actually got to spend most of the evening at home reading a good book  And today  on a day of new beginnings  I will continue to choose not to drink   I got no texts either  Also recently ended a relationship  NYE just kind of amplified my feeling alone  I am trying to view this as a time to work on myself  get stronger in sobriety  increase my social contacts  work on my sprituality  focus on my health and mental health  Seems like the perfect time as I have zero distractions  Wishing you the best  Welcome  it's good to have you here  I can really relate to what you're saying  I am   was the same  It will be nice to bring in the new year clear headed with no memory blanks or regrets  This Naked Mind changed my mindset and life  it's a great place to start  I won't drink with you today Great Video I watched that myself just absolutely the most helpful clear explanation I have ever seen about quitting  just prepping my last attempt  will be successful     To all of you here at SD  I wish you all the best in the coming year  I hope  for each and every one of you  that this will be your most productive and healthy year to date  I'm not drinking with you on this glorious first day of 2017  Yes we can do this   My first NYE sober after 17 years  Feels amazing to be able to fully enjoy this day  Lets keep this goodwork    in Not today     I'm glad you are here  While the badge may be back at one  you most certainly are not  I find it helpful to amend each of my thoughts about how I messed up  my self talk is toxic  with something along the lines of     If I could have made a different choice  I would have  What is important is how I will prepare to make a different choice next time    Then I make a list of behaviors to choose from next time I find myself in a similar situation    I will not drink with you today   Breathe  distract yourself  do something nice for yourself  Hug your family  Cry  It does get better  Going to the Dr or ER may be an option as well to help with withdrawal  Last year was my most successful year  as far as sobriety goes  2017 will be even better  But for now  I'm just going to focus on today  and not drink   Wisconsin  the Restaurant I go to is in Sister Bay specifically  Welcome back  Nope  I wouldn't know anything about actual sex  But I do know swedish pancakes  I went out to a street party last night  We ate and danced and I didn't drink  Someone insistently gave me a cup with champagne in it "for the toast"  but I just poured it in someone else's cup  I laughed and jokes and just generally had a really great time  I fricking love sobriety   That's awesome  Glad you are here  I'm with you  Messed up last night  Back to it

New Year  filled with new possibilities from good choices  I will not drink with all of you today   You are doing a great job  I believe in you Like others here  I got that too  in the earliest days

back at you  Lee  Not today   and thank you all for being here  There were some inappropriately drunk people at our party for a few minutes last night  My daughter commented on it and how it made her

of days  Best of luck I hope to a lot of motivation form all the Resolution Quitters being a step in front of me  Dont fall for the substitutes they are a filthy scam  It is like swapping rum for vodka to quit you alcohol addiction   Hey I can totally relate  I dumped my buds down the toilet and was all I could think was the money going down the drain  But like you said  in the long run  it's an investment   Also can relate to living toke to toke  No way to live    Good luck and Happy New Year  Gonna pick some up at the store today xD Sign me up   I'm in   One day at a time  one month at a time  Let's make this 2017 something we will never forget  That's rough  does your SO know about you not drinking  Do they support you in your decision  I find it's good to say a positive reason for not drinking  I say "I realised I'm happier when I'm not drinking " and have found that works really well as my reason  Isn't it silly that we have to have a reason NOT to put poison in our bodies  I think it helps to have an escape plan  like if it's not going well from the beginning having my car there to leave and leave by myself  Another thing is when people still pressure me I tell them I have a drinking problem  It stops the pressure immediately  Good on you for coming back here straight away  sometimes a slip reminds us how unenjoyable drinking is an strengthens us  Let's not drink together today    Well I cant unpee what Ive pee on    Haha wise words to live by    Sign me up please    I'm tired of breaking my mutual promise with my partner to stop watching porn  I want to do this for myself and for him  but I need a way to further hold myself accountable  I believe this'll help big time  Thanks for your service   Night bagel made me lol  Thanks for the share   Checking in  ready to rid this terrible habit from my life  Just take it one day at a time  Day one  I am concerned as I think both at the same time might be a much bigger challange  To kill those two birds with one stone you will need a very large stone   I will not drink today  He doesn't drink and constantly digs about my drinking  When I stop he complains I'm "different"  I literally can't win  I actually told the host I have a problem and am going to AA  He laughed and passed me wine  Ugh  The wife then said "I don't trust people who don't drink" WTF    Welp you're already better at it then me  I started using cocaine with the ole Saying "if I'm buying it  I'm finishing it tonight" so now I could never let it sit in a drawer while I tried not to use it  of just be blowing through it  I feel ya on the whole not having a safe place to discuss it  But if youre able to have it and not do it  youre doing great  Happy New Year  I fell asleep reading at 10 PM  didn't even see it happen  That's common for me  however  Anyway  I will not drink with you today  Thank you for being here  SD  May you have a fantastic day  You got this  Keep coming back here and checking in  Thanks scotty everytime i do this i get a bit more determined to do something about it but everytime i think im getting round it after a few weeks i slip back to drinking i survived a severe brain injury and got myself walking and talking again but this anxiety fight dwarves it I won't drink with any of you today  What kind of shoes   Nice job  hope you keep winning in 2017   I plan to win with you  First non hungover New Years Day in 15 years  dating back to high school   No amount of guilt can change the past  And no amount of anxiety can change the future  Take it one day at a time  Focus on other things besides abstaining  Take on some hobbies  spend time with others and strengthen relationships  etc  You got this  don't let a minor thing effect the progress you made  We share a birthday   exactly  Happy 36 to us  2017 will be my first full year clear of mind  I'll not drink with you today sobernauts    I was just explaining this to my husband yesterday  how drugs and alcohol initially filled a void but eventually it took more than it gave  and made the void bigger in the end   Keep it up  Today can be the end of your misery and the start of your wonderfull life  There is never a point of no return  unless you kill someone and get life in jail or something or kill yourself  that's the end   No matter what problems you have now  YOU CAN OVERCOME THEM  You take one problem at the time on  and solve it   Your biggest problem right now  you are a porn addict  Everyone here struggles with the same problem  We are here for you   When you quit porn  you'll slowly become better  But it's not easy  it takes dedication  Hell  I've only been doing this for 8 days and every day I struggle to not relapse  People report benefits  I don't see them yet  But I trust it will happen  And I know for myself that I'm doing the right thing   So the question is not "have I gone over the point of no return "  but rather "How much effort am I willing to spend to get the life I want " You

together  I have heard similar and those people are generally wanting a drinking buddy  so they don't have to take a good hard look in the mirror   I have found that I need people in my life that are supportive of my sobriety  It makes it all work easier  Happy New Year Guys  Another bloody reset for me  but at least I didn't drink last night  so no hangover today   Today I will so absolutely be NOT drinking with you all  Have a good day everyone  x Same here    I was so nervous  I thought we'd just pop in for a couple hours and then bail    we wound up staying for six hours  had a ton of fun with my friends as they got drunk  took care of my kids so my wife could socialize with her friends  The funniest part was I had concocted cranberry juice and soda water as my "drink" for the night  people just assumed I was drinking the "adult" punch  no pressure to explain that I wasn't drinking and all of that  Starting off the new year with a bit of a cold  Definitely not drinking today  Have a great new year all  Stay strong  Just remember if you  weren't  sober  that would be just one more thing in your life you wished was different  You're on the right track  The hosts sound like absolute assholes  This whole situation is making me mad for you  I'm sorry I'm not sure what to say because I'm trying to speak from the "I"     I would not be happy with my SO    What can you do in

22   me too and why was it always 3 00  it's like universal  Day 2  again  here  and happy to join you in not drinking today  x Thank you  And congratulations on day 37    It feels good to finally admit that I had a problem and feels even better to be doing something about it    My housemates had a party last night and it was so nice to be able to clean up all the mess this morning before any of them had even stirred  I'm not usually the most considerate roommate   I feel improved already   My mom had an experience like that when she was a kid but she won't talk about it  We've tried everything  Counseling  rehab  in patient therapy  The only time she brings it up is when she's drunk around me    Taking her to therapy is an excellent option  See if the therapist will allow you to sit in on one of the first sessions so you can tell your mom why you're so worried  The therapist may also have family counseling options available   I have been in your shoes and it's an uncomfortable place to be  My understanding is  with couples therapy and much communication  some people are able to carry on being sober with a spouse who drinks  I personally could not    In October of this year I moved out of my marital home and in December my divorce was finalized  He is still my best friend but I am an alcoholic in recovery  and he's an alcoholic in denial   The decision was difficult but necessary  for me  I had to decide to put sobriety before each and every thing in my life  because if I had gone back to drinking  I would have lost everything anyway   As an alcoholic I am a great actor  I can put on a good face and I can even fool those around me sometimes when I am drinking  But they don't know how deeply miserable and out of control I feel when I am drinking  I don't know about the cravings and the obsession and the guilt remorse and shame  So even if others think they like me better when I drink  I DON'T  like myself when I drink  And ultimately  that is what matters  I tried chocolate peppermint tea for NYE  Delish  There is no luck buddy  only choices  it gets so good the choice will be clear but not easy  wishing you the best man   I will not drink today  Yes  That's great   My kind off New year's eve   A couple of weeks ago my husband and I were going through an extremely rough patch  Like to the point he left and I was left alone with only my thoughts and I think the best decision I ever made was not drinking during that time  It would have made me feel so much worse and made me do or say things I regret   I know how hard break ups are  They are all consuming  especially if you are the one who has been broken up with   Please take care of yourself during this rough time  I will not be drinking with you today     I like to think that my newfound sobriety beginning March of last year was lead in practice for a much better year this year  and truly there are amazing differences in me  this  morning versus the morning of 01 01 2016     Raises coffee cup high  Here's to hope and change we all on SD can believe in  Happy New Year  us all   Virtual clinks  I'm with you  I was surrounded by close friends and family that were drinking quite a bit  Not only did they not care  they fully supported me throughout the night  I had a great time and feel great the day after   which hasn't happened in over a decade  The brain is plastic  meaning we can change it  It is never to late to recreate ourselves  you just need to take it one day at a time  The good thing about hitting rock bottom is you are basically hitting a point that you know you have a problem and you despise the problem  Now you need a strategy to beat it   My current strategy is to only make it through today  I don't care about tomorrow  next week  streaks  etc  I just need to survive today  We are excellent procrastinators so when I have the urge to watch I just procrastinate from watching it till the urge subsides  We only have so much willpower so I'm making sure to use it for this addiction  I want to improve other areas of my life  but first I want to get this under control before I use my willpower for other things   You are not beyond getting healed  I have read success stories from people on way worse conditions than you that have beat this  We have the power to overcome this  the only thing that sucks is this shit will be in the back of our minds for the rest of our lives  We just have to get to a point where those urges don't do anything to us    Don't give up buddy  Good morning  SD  Waking up rested on New Years Day is never gonna grow old  I will not drink today  Wishing you all a happy and sober 2017  Hey kool  Congratulations  Very true Day 3 for me  This sub has been crucial to me these past 72 hours  I check in here every time the the struggle overwhelms  So pleased to have found it   My friends who were fully supportive of my recovery  help me find other ways to connect with them  He is where my real friends  the ones who cared about me beyond the Barfly that sat beside them  So  we went to movies  and restaurants  and had game night  and found other ways to spend time together and have fun away from alcohol   The people who only had a bottle in common with me  the people I went to the bar and sat with us I got drunk and I thought we're such good friends   those people faded away  When times got rough and life handed me lemons  they were busy putting lemons in their vodka while I stayed sober   I also found it useful to get involved in the recovery community  and through meetings and Alcoholics Anonymous  I've developed a brand new network of friends  I learned how to have fun without alcohol  it took a while but it was worth it   "If you want to know who your real friends are  get sober " Welcome back QB   As far as I'm concerned  you never left   Practice makes perfect   Happy New Years Dude  One day at a time  Welcome  I will not drink with you today  I flew across the country yesterday and now I'm jet lagged  It feels kind of like a hangover  Possibilitarian has a sober birthday today  Thank you  runnermansud  You are to blame for my success this time around  Thanks for the recommendation to download the 30 Day book  It's helped me immensely   Going for a run soon to listen to day 8    Anyway  congrats on your sober NYE  I did something similar with my 9 year old son  only root beer floats  and we didn't quite make it anywhere near midnight    Anyway  congratulations  May you have a most wonderfully  fulfilling  hangover free day     Perfect  Congratulations  Week one was an absolute blur of emotions  Yep  I'm awesome  so I won't drink today with you also      Happy New Year  I won't drink with you today  Nice  isn't it  Thank you  Happy New Year  Same boat for me  I was at two weeks then drank on Christmas and then drank a couple of days ago  Badge reset  I'm ready   well badge hasn't been reset  but I requested it to be     You got this  Happy New Year  See you here tomorrow  Strong work on 2 years  Congratulations   Hey Mom  Happy New Year  I did it    Can't say I was in the best mood all evening  but I didn't drink so I'm in a good mood now    I will not drink today  And to you  too  I may stay in my pjs all day today  Nothing like being sober and comfy  Happy New Year  Good morning and happy New year  one and all  I will not drink today no matter what gets thrown my way  Happy New Year  See you here tomorrow  Me too  I managed a few stints in 2016  I'll not drink with you today  and yeah  here's to a sober 2017  x About  5 to  7 a day  But between buying vapes and accessories all the time it works out to much more than that per day  Thank you  Happy New Year  Welcome  Good luck    Happy New Year  shine  I will not drink today   Whenever you feel urge remind yourself how you feel now  It helps a lot to prevent further relapses  Ha  Thank you  It's not as thick as it looks  it's actually pretty fine  I just have a LOT of it  But thanks    You are an alcoholic  The inability to control ones drinking is the description of an alcoholic  I am a binge type alcoholic meaning once I start I cannot stop  I was not physically dependant on alcohol and didn't need an assisted detox  binge drinking is psychological  Just because you don't drink every day or you don't drink in the mornings doesn't mean you do not have a problem and doesn't make us better than alcoholics that do  Our problems just manifests in different ways and is actually the gateway to this type of drinking   The scary thing is most people who drink can't control it  Keep on Truckin'  Exactly this    And   if you were drunk the sadness and crying would be cranked up to 11    I got no texts and have been questioning how many of my friends were really drinking buddies  Let's get through this together  and come out stronger and with more friends   Hang in there  Annie  Happy New Year to all the SD community    Just for today let us all NOT drink together     Checking in  getting 2017 started off right  Craving today   but not drinking with you fine folks Thanks  Tracey  I'll check them out       I was told to I needed to stop  letting my control issues interfere with my treatment when I was inpatient  so I was hesitant to bring up the diagnosis with treatment team at home because I didn't want them to think my ED was in control again and I was being non compliant  I did speak with my therapist about it and explained my thoughts and feelings  We're working through it  It still bothers me  but not nearly as much as it did before   Right  She kissed me  I didn't push anything  I'm typically more aggressive sexually but bc of what she said previously I questioned it and the response was ambiguous based on the history of our communication  What I am dealing with is a dry drunk  It's manipulation I'm thinking  I hope you can too  Hang in there  x Ok   lets not drink today  I'm going out tonight on the town still as I'm on holiday and need to make it up to my other half after ruining NYE  Let's all check in tomorrow and say how we've done   I guess we all need a bit of a plan though   I will not drink today   Thanks SD  I'm here  ready to do this  I might enjoy it more   you never know   No better time than the first day of a new year  Good luck  x Congrats on a year sober   so happy for you  The drinking age in England is 18 which means most kids start drinking at 15  Scary stuff  Happy New Year Lee  Don't try and quit forever   Just try and quit for a day  Then  quit for another day   If you get high or drunk  start over if you want   There is no dead line to this and looking at like you have to quit forever today is too big  it sets you up for failure   Gotta take it one little bit at a time   If a day at a time is too big  do it hour by hour   When you are ready to quit  you'll know because you'll want to quit and it won't work until you are ready to quit    Above all  be kind to yourself and to don't put too much preasure on yourself to succeed   Easy does it   No rush  you have the rest of your life to get this right  Today is a new day   I am not drinking today  Girl  believe me    I am not pressuring her  As a woman myself I am listening   One day at a time  Focus on making it through today and overtime that counter will grow  Soot paying attention to streaks and abstaining  Instead focus on becoming the greatest version of yourself  This addiction is no joke as we all know  So we must take it seriously  Don't give up  There are many people who have very many different opinions on this  I personally have eliminated alcohol in all forms from my life  That includes mouthwash  Nyquil with alcohol  etc     As for cooking with alcohol  there are many alternatives  If you cooked professionally you know you can certainly use stocks or other liquids instead of alcohol   For me personally  here is my thought on it  why do we cook with alcohol  For the flavor  I'm an alcoholic  the last thing I need is the flavor of alcohol  It doesn't matter what the alcohol by volume proof amount is after the product is cooked  a mouthful of wine flavor reminds me of the real thing  It is a choice I have made in support of my sobriety    Some people aren't quite as stringent about it and they have no problem  Others find that it is a slippery slope  Just like recovery in general  there is no one correct answer  You can do it  Three days ago I was you  Today I feel my best self in years  Best of luck  I'm here for you   I will not drink today  I'll take a coffee hangover over a booze hangover any day of the week and twice on Sunday    Me too  High five  Yes  this times a million  My image of drinking in my mind and the reality of it could not be more different  When I think about drinking it's in a cosy pub by a log fire chatting with a good friend while slowly sipping a glass of wine  It's never happened  Reality  Drinking two bottles of wine a night and practically gulping down the first while hiding empties from my wife  Next morning I'm shaking and sweating while desperately not trying to be sick   That old image in my mind needs to go  You're back here  that's what matters now  Keep at it  I will not drink today  It's amazing to think about where my head was a year ago versus today  I'm excited to see what 2017 has in store  Happy New Year    No one else "cared"  I have usually found this to be the case  I was lucky to get this lesson on night 2  and it was a huge confidence builder reinforcing that I was pursuing sobriety for me    Have a great 2107  It's a great feeling any day but it's especially nice on the first day of the new year  Congrats  I will not drink with you today as well    Just possession thankfully  I guess I'm kind of lucky because it's my first offense  and my lawyer said that I'll probably just be on probation for 6 months and if I do everything right than I won't have the conviction on my record  It's definitely a way more expensive process than I thought   The day after I hit 5 months sober  my spouse at the time was diagnosed with aggressive cancer  By keeping in touch with other people in recovery  and actively using a support system built of friends  family  and professionals  I survived it and stayed sober  Other challenges have come along in the years and months since then   and it has most certainly never been easy  But I know I need to stay sober no matter what  and a drink isn't going to help any challenge I am facing  You certainly should be proud of yourself  It's amazing how our lives consisted on drinking and when we can drink  It's a merry go round I needed off  Congratulations on looking deep and wanting off too  Sometimes looking at are selves is the hardest first thing to do during recovery  Good Luck you got this   Not drinking today   Nice  Congrats on your year and lovely transformation  inside to out  https   youtu be nabO UXb6MM  Elliott Smith   Fond Farewell   "Pitch burning on a shining sheet The only maker that youd wanna meet"  So many relatable lines in the song Feeling great today   Made it through party weekend  Watching SO with a massive headache today makes me feel great about my work this weekend  Next big test will be getting through a big presentation at work on Wednesday  Lots of anxiety building up about it  How you doing shonky  I will not drink today  I spent all of 2016 sober  and my plan is to be able to say the same thing about 2017 a year from now  But I will always take it one day at a time   Congrats  Thanks for your honesty  it's not all roses    you're an inspiration to me  Will not drink today   Happy New Year everyone  I just turned down a line of blow for the first time in years Happy New Year  Welcome  I can share with you what I've learned from managing my diet now that I've eliminated booze from the equation  The missing intake of all the calories and sugar from alcohol is obviously big  BUT  in my humble opinion it's the sober food decisions you'll make that makes the difference  For example  you are way less likely to order a burger and fries on a Saturday night at a restaurant when you're sober  On the flip side drunk me was always like fuck it  another slice please  After a year I was down over 40 pounds  It was the easiest weight I've ever lost  Im a life long weight fluctuator but staying sober has made it SO much easier to keep the weight off    As for tips I'd say to remember this one  One day at a time  Sounds like a cliche AA thing right  That's what I thought at first too  However it really works  If you think about not drinking again forever it can be very overwhelming  But not drinking just for today is much easier  I'm not going to drink with you today   Congrats on  7  you shit show     100 days today  Got a good night's sleep and was thrilled to go to bed sober  I will not drink today  Today is one of those days when I realize just how thankful I am to wake up sober and without a hangover  I'll carry this thankfulness with me through today and not drink  At least get a stripper than can lick her own balls  I will not drink today  no matter what happens  Happy New Year Everyone and Best Wishes for 2017 on a Not Drinking Today New Years Day   Been there done that  At my girlfriends and my apartment on the futon  Many times  So shameful  BUT  that's all over now and forever  I won't drink with you today  I'm no drug and alcohol counselor  but I have a feeling if you are this concerned about becoming an alcoholic based upon that amount frequency of getting drunk  and you realize the negatives it has caused you  you likely would not allow yourself to blindly progress into severe alcoholism  You seem very aware of the nature of your relationship with it  which is leaps and bounds past where I was at way back when my problem was a 1 2 day per month binge to get drunk  I didn't fully realize I had an issue until I was drinking nearly every day  That said  what you describe is exactly how I started down the road to daily hard drinking  many years later  Force yourself to stay aware that it is not necessarily a "harmless" path  even if it is a completely socially acceptable level of drinking in your circle of friends and or family  Good luck  I'm with you  let's do it   Kind of like my top comment  Who even says "Oh my shit"  I kinda remember drinking election night  Feeling fresh too  and yes it does feel bloomin' awesome   Happy New Year to you x   Hope you stick around Yoga  As Cheese says  it's nice here  You are among friends  x Yeah  I am going to hit a beach meeting and then the Alcathon at the club in Englewood  Florida   Seems that will be a reasonable way to start a year  Tired of the random bruises  Not remembering how they got there or why  Did I fall  Maybe  When I was detoxing I lost my sense of balance so badly I couldn't even stand at the toilet straight enough to piss  I'd fall backwards into the closet door  Never want to experience that again  Keep it up chief   It can creep up out of nowhere  Remember that those beautiful memories under starry skies were you and the people and nature  The cigarettes just happened to be there  I wish you strength   you can keep building beautiful moments without them  I won't drink today  I survived last night and went to bed sober  I'm doing that again tonight  Happy New Year  I will not drink with you today  Happy New Year to all of you amazing  inspiring people  I won't drink today either     This sub is definitely awesome   It gave me my life back    Maybe stop worrying about "stopping for all time" and focus just on this day  or this hour  "All time" is a bit much for anyone to comprehend  especially a scared part of you  Wishing you the best  Shit yeah  Keep it the f up  Incredible story  Thanks so much for sharing  You look great  it's always most noticeable in the eyes  there's so much life there now   I love that you mentioned getting your endorphin from the gym  I haven't had to convince myself to workout since quitting because that natural good feeling is such a stress reducer    Congrats and Happy New Year  I did it  I masturbated without porn at 7am because I know I wouldn't fall asleep for another 10 hours  just like the previous 10 hours  Awesome   Have a warm and cozy day  I'm so glad you made that decision   Even though I have over two months sober now  I have the same 24 hours to get thru today that you do   We're going to do it together  and be better for it tomorrow   I won't drink with you today  I'll join you in that  Harry  x Welcome and good luck in January and going forward   My resolution   Time to put down the cigs    sigh Congrats  I'm on day 39 today and agree with the fact that life is much better without it  I feel so much better than I did a couple months ago as well  Happy new year mate  It is very simple  Just take it one day at a time  Focus less on abstaining and more on improving yourself  The more time spent on other things the less time you have for porn  Good luck  Happy new year  everyone  No drinking for me today  this week  this month OR this year  Hope 2017 is the best year yet for you all  Can't wait  Wow  January 1st and I'm not hung over  I will not drink with you today  I will not drink today  I remember every detail  hubs gave me a kiss at midnight  we stayed in   I got up early  gave mom a shower and got her cleaned up  then did a a short yoga practice  I feel awesome      I was 21  and it was normal to drink like that  Right      and then at 30  because I'm still young  right      and then at 35  because I'm not as bad as my friends  right   You totally made the right call   Congratulations on 23 days  That's amazing  I love the idea of dong things I've never done before in 2017  I may have to steal that  Happy New Year  I had almost the exact same situation happen with friends  and most shockingly at the time  my ex husband  It was during one of my many short term attempts at sobriety over the years  Looking back it makes me realize how many of my friends were just "good time" bar friends and not real relationships and friendships  As far as my ex husband goes  he had his own very deep rooted alcoholism to deal with that he never wanted to  and through the grapevine as I hear  still never has   The hardest thing is to feel like you are making a change that you so desperately want to make for your self  and the people around you don't want to support  or make jabs  or flat out say things like they like you better you are more fun when you are drinking  All I can say is try and be strong and don't buckle to the pressure or let the comments get in your head  You have to do what you know will make you happiest and feel the best  I forgot about this post  this is actually worthy of a post in and of itself if you think about it     Happy KRATOM FREE New Year  That sounds like an amazing weekend  This was my first year too since about the same age  Last year I decided I wouldn't go out to a party and instead drank alone for the evening and slept all through Jan 1  Today is an awesome change    Congrats and happy new year  Day five was the hardest for me  Keep up the good fight  Oh how I don't miss having to send those texts  or apologize for stuff I don't remember   Congratulations on 3 months  Split from my partner 3 years ago on the 4th of Jan  I know that pain  we were together 7 years and have a son  It really hurt  drinking didn't help the hurt go away  Only in sobriety have I learnt to deal with stuff that previously I would have hidden under a cloak of drunkenness    I am so glad for you  that you have not picked up a drink  I will join you in not drinking today  together we are stronger  many hugs x  Yup  Glad you have the strength to make it 51 days  I relapsed two times after joining this sub  I hope this time I won't touch the booze for good  Your words helped Thank You

worth it   Good luck   happy  kratom free  2017   Yes  I've had those memories pop up on the Facebook that don't even involve a party and I think  "Hmmm  I wonder     Was I half drunk or was the anxiety spiking with a hang over    yuck "  It could have been neither  but the question is always there   Time to make new memories   Best wishes with your new memories and the 23 days   I'll happily not drink with you today    Slept in today  but not due to a hangover  Happy New Year's everyone and I will not drink today  I will not drink today no matter what happens  You might really enjoy the

for so long  I'm amazed at your strength and ability to carry on  You might think at times you're weak  but that just isn't so  Even in the darkest of times you're clinging desperately to life all whilst it's doing its best to shake you off  You are ridiculously brave and strong  It might not mean much  but I believe in you  And I'm so so proud of you for fighting  If you ever need anyone to talk to  I'm always around  Please don't hesitate to reach out  I hope 2017 is as amazing as you are  It was not a mistake  you're correct   Also there isn't really anything for you to agree or

what I'm grateful for   And no drinking  no matter what  you good dude  don't stress  just slip that under the rug and keep on chuggin  props for not falling back into it too heavy  happy new years   I have a suggestion regarding the title   instead of "victor" perhaps the term "hero" would fit better   since  "Victor"  a person who defeats an enemy or opponent in a battle  game  or other competition  Example  "congratulations to the victors"  The people beat the challenge  and technically the ones who failed  but that is a bit of a negative spin  Since we are more like a band of brothers  and sisters  fighting a war against evil   And a hero is defined as   1  a person noted for courageous acts or nobility of character  He became a local hero when he saved the drowning child  2  a person who  in the opinion of others  has special achievements  abilities  or personal qualities and is regarded as a role model or ideal   The people that beat the challenge should be regarded as role models and persons who have achieved something we all aspire to   So I would propose  "CONGRATULATIONS TO THE   HEROES   OF THE STAY CLEAN 2016 YEAR LONG CHALLENGE "  and december challenge     You guys are real role models and heroes for having completed this challenge Thank you  I made it  Have a headache from crying but feel better   Happy New Year my friend  Thank you  I will check that channel out today  Happy New Year  That's awesome  I actually went to a convention last night and sat in 4 meetings  My social anxiety made it tough after a full day so I ended up going home at 10 before the dance started  I feel lame for leaving so early but hey  I didn't drink   Happy Birthday    I raise my LaCroix to you  Happy 2017  No problem    I am  The anxiety is down quite a bit  Still shaky and a bit disoriented but starting to get there    For victims of violence and crime  Not exactly witness protection  although there are women here going into witsec   Count me in and SIGN ME UPPPPP I was finding empties hidden everywhere  luck  Thanks  Happy New Years QB  You're almost at half a year  And for those thinking of relapsing trust me when I say you're not missing anything   I will not drink today   Happy new year  I won't drink today  thanks y'all  Yeah I read somewhere that if you are not into going to the meetings  which I'm not  you can recondition your mind yourself  You have to treat your alcoholic brain as a separate to your sober brain  And remember that your sober brain is always in control as long as you don't have a drink  and learning to tell your alcoholic brain no  eventually it gets smaller and smaller until it is hardly heard  it sounds daft but has pretty much worked for me   so far   what a great story   Congrats  Sign me up  Alcoholism is a progressive disease and if you are an alcoholic it WILL get worse  you will drink more  and more often  possibly becoming a daily drinker  As a person who drank too much I looked at others and said "at least i'm not as bad as THAT person  he's really got a problem there"    I went to A A  because I knew I had a problem with alcohol and after listening to other people describe the progression and their problems I was able to see that although not a daily drinker and even able to not drink for periods of time   I AM an alcoholic  I am grateful that I was able to accept the truth and then start doing what I had to do to live with my alcoholism  Many people come to meetings  hear exactly what I heard  feel as I felt  but because of fear or denial go back to drinking and try to control it and some take many years and a viscious beating from their addictions before they are ready to accept help  It is a choice each one of us has to make on our own  nobody else can make it for me  A A  members know this mental trap well because everybody has had to get past it to stay sober and there is lots of help and encouragement for new people coming in  If you think you have a problem with alcohol  and if somewhere  in the back of your mind a quiet little voice says "you might be an alcoholic" then do yourself a favour  spend an hour and go to an open meeting of A A  and listen to the experience  strength and hope being shared there and If you find yourself saying "I'm just like them    I've felt just like that  Oh my god  I thought I was the only one " then admitting you are an alcoholic is not so bad because you are not alone and there is a solution  And if you are not an alcoholic then you had a lousy free coffee and met some weird people you don't relate to at all and you can say " at least i'm not as bad as THOSE people  from the sounds of it  they really shouldn't drink"      Yeah I'm pretty sure I got married last night   I vaguely remember anything but it sounds like I had a great time   And I guess there was a boy but I lost him   along with one sock and my shoes   So I just walked home with one sock and someone's slippers Haha  Are they  your  shoes  though  Even at 4months your glow was incredible  Congrats   What people post on social media  is often a fake  'best representation' of themselves and what they are doing YOU have done it  last night you did it and you should be proud of yourself  being sober is worth it    It does get better  Take care  I won't drink with you today   Sign me up lets do this  Listen a lot  Take the good  leave the bad   Start some new friendships  get a sponsor   And go to different meetings   some are better than others    Also   detox can be deadly  See a doctor and be honest in your drinking   Brand new to this been looking for a while here it goes   I will not drink today  how do I get a badge    It feels great to actually see a new years as an adult and not be wasted  In our entire adult lives we have not been sober on new years  Crazy huh  Yo  Swedish pancakes are super simple to make on your own though  and try eating them with vanilla ice cream and Strawberry jam  there ain't nothing better   Source  am Swedish   That's nice to hear  thanks  I intend to make this a lasting change and will be sticking around   x I will not drink today It's awesome isn't it  About to head out with the family to one of our favorite parks for a picnic  Had I drank I would be on the couch right now feeling miserable and maybe even sneaking in more alcohol to "cure" the hangover   Congratulations all  Congratulations    It's a wonderful feeling to not have it on the list of things you want to improve Thanks  nice to get your reply  Looking forward to being part of this community   Happy New Year

need it  I think the same thing  One month done  I will not drink today    Hey I'm just catching up on last nights posts and saw yours  How are you doing today  Any better  I spent the night crying til I fell asleep  I wanted to drink so badly  I don't know why  Cause I'm alone I guess  The Husband could not have picked a worse time to be gone    I will be ok  No matter how fucking cold it is outside  I am taking my new pedometer for a brisk walk  Happy New Year  Woah  I'm not sure how your marriage is otherwise but I would take  that as a red flag  My partner lightly drinks but drinks a lot less since I've been attempting to stop and has been super supportive  If you can't have your significant other  who you live with and spend the most time with in your life be you rock  who will

I'll do the Humpty Dance with you  yeAH DRUGS were a boomerang that came back around and cut me the shreds   Glad to be free   and maybe even sneaking in more alcohol to "cure" the hangover     Oh boy can I relate to this  One of the many illogical excuses I gave myself to continue on my path of self destruction  Enjoy your hangovers free picnic  Seems like an example of sour grapes  your goal is right but your means of achieving it are wrong   I still go out with friends  but not to bars or anyplace where drinking is the main event  We do dinners  brunches  coffee dates  etc  Last night I was out and about at places where drinking wasn't the only "thing" to do  For me  it's important to still have a social life with the people that respect my choices and boundaries  I am lucky to have friends that drink normally  Last night they had a glass of wine with dinner and half a glass of champagne at midnight  What   I was happy to sober  they didn't care and no one got sloppy  Happy New Year   Made it     I've been miserable drunk  and I've been miserable sober   I remember a lot of shitty New Year's in my 15 years of alcoholism   I don't think I ever had a date for one  and I've spent many alone   For me  all sobriety offers is a chance  one of two paths   I know where the alcoholic one leads  I've been down it so many times   I haven't been down this one   I don't know if it will lead to happiness  being with someone I love  the magic kiss on New Year's we were all promised   I think there's a possibility it might   I know the other one doesn't   That one ends in misery   All I know about this path is I don't know where it goes   I wish you much happiness in the future   I have a feeling you'll find it  I will not drink today  no matter what happens  30 35 hours is nothing compared to some people here  me   I put in 120 hours over 2 weeks  55 of which were in dota 2  I don't do anything else with my life and that's why I decided to stop  Welcome back  I've recently had a reset too  I'm glad I'm back with you because sober feels so good   I bought some shitty looking wing tips at a thrift store for  30   The plan is to try to restore them or strip them and dye them blue     Last night I was trying to figure out what there are   The markings are all pretty much illegible     Turns out their an old shoe called British Walkers   I can't tell when they stopped making shoes because there is a new company by the same name    Here's the before and after so far with a little bit of cleaning on the left shoe   http   imgur com SkmqrjJ I'm where you were   It looks like a long way from here   Good luck with the nightmares lol  happy new year  Get out of your comfort zone you been in for so long  I know the feeling  If you come home  sit on the couch and normally start with a couple of beers  Than dont sit on the couch  help the wife to cook  play with the kids  clean up the garden  just set your mind for something else  I really needed to find another "addiction" and ended up in the gym on a daily basis  That worked for me for some time sorry if that was the impression given   Ahhhh  I see   my second click was on http   www baltimoreaa org

my yam bag against her ass cheeks for her to have had that kind of time    Thanks OP P   You've got this  I find if I get a craving and can distract myself for twenty minutes or so  that it passes   Sometimes I have to commit to not drinking for just 30 more minutes to work my way to another day   Also  check out r stopdrinking and if anybody tells you anything today  it should be this   You will never again have to feel the way you do right now  All  The  Time   I know     It's actually quite awesome that they called you  You must be an amazing aunt  Nicely done    I love your name  Glad to have you here   Welcome    Dry december completed  I will not drink with you today on the first of the year   I told my parents last night as well  Good luck to you  waking up this morning without my morning smoke was tough  but I'm ready for the battle  Happy Sober New Year  I look forward to congratulating you at your six month mark which is right around the corner  I will not drink today with you  We can do this  if you can make it 50 days  you can make it 5000 days   Welcome  We're glad your here too  Happy New Year  whyquit com had been very useful for me for quitting smoking What a great post  Sobriety does give us and them wonderful gifts of being loving humans  I won't drink with you today   I went to a friend's house for a party and left my kids home with my husband who all fell asleep at 8  I got home about 2  I was able to stop a couple from drunk driving with their kids in the car   I drove them home instead  I got home and curled up in bed with my son  I had promised him I would have a sleep over with him  and noticed when I got in bed the room was not spinning and I didn't have to get up all throughout the night to throw up or have explosive stomach issues   Best of all I was able to wake up with my kids and make them breakfast with no nausea or headache and am not irritable  We are watching Harry Potter as a family   It's so different from my nights of drinking  It was odd watching all my friends getting drunk throughout the night but The drunker everyone became the more grateful I was to not be fucked up  Plus there is a freedom in knowing I can do or say anything and no one will remember anything tomorrow   I still am told a lot how I didn't really have a problem  asked why did I stop  am told I didnt drink anywhere near as much as everyone else so I could not have had issues etc   but I would just shrug and not give a fuck   How great is that   You are the cool aunt  nice moniker  Awesome  Sounds like a perfect day   Congratulations on one week  I found that one to be the hardest   Recently I saw the following retort on here  or something to this effect   "We like you better when you drink " "I like you better when I drink  too " Whether or not someone actually wants to say it to your close family friends  it makes me laugh to imagine   That sucks about your husband and friend  It seems to me that 1  they enjoy drinking with you and are worried about losing that  I was one of those people who felt like I bonded better with people when we were drinking  I'm sure I was wrong  but that was a belief I really had   2  they want to make you feel bad insecure  the implication of their comments being that that they don't like you now and you could lose them  so that you'll drink with them  and or 3  they don't like what your stopping drinking says  in their minds  about their own drinking    To answer your question   I haven't yet had that experience with other people  What I can say is that when I was online dating while still drinking  and I saw that someone said they didn't drink  I was like  "NOOOOO " Because I wanted to keep Getting Drunk as one of my main extracurricular activities  and they didn't fit into that interest of mine  So my aversion to dating a non drinker was really about wanting to keep drinking a focal point of my life  It was about me  not about them   However  even if your husband's and friend's behaviors are rooted in their own feelings and are not about you  it's still a dick move to say those things   Pretty gnarly NYE  emotionally speaking  Stayed sober  but now I have a cold  Most definitely not drinking  Happy 2017 everyone  Ah  but you were strong on the inside  too  Great job  Happy New Year  In celebration of 2017  I will remain sober today    You can do it       Congratulations on winning yesterday's fight  Happy New Year  Literally the first thing I thought about when I woke up  So glad to be sober  iDoneDo thank you for hosting  My second day sober  I will not drink with you all today  Thanks  Thank you  Hey startwalking  I'm with you at 55 days  SD is my go to friend when I need an understanding confidant  Congratulations and Happy New Year  sign me up  I do it all the time  no worries   bud  I just did it yesterday   to my gf  That girl doesn't know it yet  but she is so gonna marry me   Dunno if it's a drunk thing  or if I'm just a hopeless romantic   But ya  when I get super slammed  all I think about is getting married  I have always wanted to be  and had a few close calls  but I could never afford the ring ceremony   Welcome  This is

the inspiring post  After 16 years I too saw the light and have accepted that drinking is no longer for me in any way  That one mindset change has taken sobriety from a chore to a delight  I wish you

That's amazing  You really could've saved a bunch of lives there by offering to drive  How sad that some people will endager their kids lives    alcohol is such a poison  How inspiring  You rock  How do I get the star and days by my name    What causes seizures is it not having enough alcohol in your system just makes your stomach spaz out or what  Happy New Year Ripster  I've been watching your

horses back much longer  Good luck to you as well  LET'S DO THIS     Fucken'a  Brink  Organisms and getting Fucken up is what life is all about   And ya  restaurant work is very conductive to both  Sorry you're hurting  I am  too  after my spine surgery  but meh  Finally found an rx that helps and mixes well with booze   But it sounds like you're doing it right  Just cum and drink through the pain  I am right there with you  One love  Your post sums up my thoughts perfectly   Have a great new year  I'm not drinking today  no matter what happens   Checking in  Good luck to everyone  Congrats and Happy New Year  With your 90   51 days  you were sober for  at least  39  of 2016  Not too shabby  Focus on having healthy relationships with my family members  namely my mother  Get back to doing yoga daily and making it a point to find something to be thankful for in each and every day   Wow   That is great   Congrats on one year    Sign me up  I must have signed up for the January instead of the year long by mistake  Regardless  I'm here  Can vouch for Galapentin  That's what I'm taking after my spine surgery for nerve pain  It mixes well with booze  too  I went vegan on New Years day 7 years ago and lost 30 pounds in the first 60 days  Never looked back  I'll tell you  the best thing that happened when my husband ran away for someone else on the 1st day of my sobriety is  I have been able to handle it with more self respect   greater strength than if I'd been drinking  I was able to see things clearly much faster  no drunken texts  emails or embarrassing calls to recover from  and somewhere along the way  I regained my sense of self worth  I'll not drink with you on that     I'm not drinking today  That's sounds like fun  and I'm so  so glad about the book but of course you're to credit for your success  Happy New Year my friend   You can do this  Keep remembering  nothing gets better with booze  It is like sticking your head in the sand  sooner or later you have to come out for air  you might as well smell the roses  Now THATS a party  Sounds great and Happy New Year  Look in the sidebar on the right to request a badge  Welcome    Sign me up

Let's continue and make 2017 even better   Checking in     I love your optimism but that is quite a goal to set  let's go for 60 first  A manageable goal  small steps   I will not drink with you today  "That kid that was drunk in New Orleans was from seemingly another lifetime  I can't help him avoid the trap he's about to fall into  I can only work on today "   YES  I relate so much  I'm going to

pretty much what I did  didn't sleep for 90 hours after the sub was finished  but I got the fuck through it   I was just shy of ten years near constant heroin use  Plus crack  cocaine  alcohol etc  Proper self medicater   When you're going through hell  keep going  Fight them on the fucking beaches  I wish you all the best my friend  Get a support network  Feels awesome  Everyone in my GF's family was drinking  I was even given booze as a present  I'm happy to say I didn't drink  And if I had  my GF's family would probably hope to never see me again  NYE seems like the super bowl of sobriety  I play a game called "drink"  The rules are simple    When I open the bottle  I drink it    Whoever drinks wins  "Just for today  I will not drink  I will    	 Nourish myself with reading  meditation and food 	 Slow down during my day and keep things simple   Greet every person with the kindness of a long lost friend" Organisms  Ahaha   Yes  life is about organisms   I will not drink today   It is very great and thanks for the comments stoptrickie  They do think I'm pretty cool    weird      I've been told by my SO that I am "no fun" anymore and I need "to just relax" and "have a little balance" in my life  Blah blah blah  I guess I've heard it all at this point  It's frustrating not having any support but if I put myself in her shoes  she's lost her drinking buddy  her partner in crime  So I get it    Hope you can stay strong in your resolve to not drink  If you can make it through these early hurdles it does get easier   fantastic  boyfriend's in bed with a hangover and I am sitting on the chaise near a window enjoying a cup of coffee in my new Cat Lady mug from a friend     here's to us In  Not drinking today  In  Not drinking today  You are a kick ass aunt   So glad you could get them home safely    No drinks today   Hang in there  Ha  sup fash  Ya  I actually had a really good year  Some sulky shit happened as well  but that's part for the CA course  All in all  2016 brought me an awesome gf  roomatell   and a  cheap place to live  I really can't hate    Glad everyone enjoyed my stories   Love you all you drunks around here  Hey man  if it helps    I'm only about 12 hrs ahead  Oxy here    never experimented with H Fent but I cant say I wouldnt have    I keep trying to repeat to myself that with each passing moment  not only are you that farther from the beast but you're also never going to have to worry about those first days ever again if you choose  I had some significant clean time before this last rodeo that ended up being months long  I'm so sick of the cycle    despite it sucking out of the gate  it's something that we can choose to never do again  feel me  If you can white knuckle without the subs  that sounds like the move    Best of luck  we are in this mess side by side  PM me anytime  Time to tackle the next year of our life  And THAT is what I'd call a Happy New Year   Nice  Well done  I know to a normal person it doesn't seem like a long time but to an addict a day is a long time   I'll be on a month at 7pm   For the next couple of weeks   r cripplingalcoholism is participating in our yearly population survey

a cathedral yesterday evening   was pretty damn good and a great way to avoid alcohol for a handful of hours   Last thing  kids wanted to stay up until midnight  wife and I didn't   but wife wanted a glass of wine   Asked if it would bug me and assured me she wouldn't drink if it bothered me at all   I said I didn't care   and I really didn't   until we were both in bed watching Bob's Burgers and I could smell the Chianti   damn   I actually wanted a taste  but I ignored it and sipped my green tea instead   Wife never has much to drink so it was a 1 2 glass at most and gone in a few minutes   But it was probably the most tempted I've been since I quit   just for the smell and taste   not b c I wanted a buzz or anything   Anyhow  all done with 2016   Not my worst year but in the running   Here's to making 2017 my best year yet  and with a strong sober start like I've never known in my adult life   I can't fail with this kind of momentum and support from SD to keep going   I will not drink today   Add me as well please and thank you  Thanks  and I will join you in saying F' 2016 and not drinking today  Sign me up please  My first sponsor was literally the first guy i met in AA   I kept seeing him at meetings and after a couple of weeks when i realized i needed a sponsor to make this work i asked him   He said of course   It felt weird asking because i made it out in my head to be a bigger deal than it really was   I felt like i was asking somebody to go out on a date or get married or something   That got me all nervous  But really it was no big deal  It was super important for me to get a sponsor  i probably wouldn't be sober today without one to help me through the steps  but asking someone isn't that big a deal   You can always change sponsors if things aren't working out   If you think the sponsor isn't right for you  ask around for other people's opinions   And of course you can start out with a temporary sponsor just to get you moving in the right direction   Ha  indeed I am ready to fly happily through '17  Lots of happy flying  I'm doing very well  thanks  Look at you the STAR of CA and Fash the STARLETTE of Opis  I finished 8th  Im in AWE of you two  This counts for a shot and a shot cheers  But Eighth  PLEASE Im gonna quit my job devote my whole days to these two places we shall see next year  hahaha Im coming for you  u FashionablyFake and you  u Lemarchand Buhahahaha I did basically the same thing  Got drunk early with my brother  just around the house  Played some video games  but meh  it's just New Years  and we're getting too old for this shit  I am totes fine with staying in and not getting arrested   lolz  Good luck and Happy New Year   I'm grateful today  I know EXACTLY what you are talking about   You did the right thing   You put yourself and your sobriety first  which is what we all should be doing   Please don't beat yourself up over it      Once I start drinking I want more and more and more  That's the big one for me  and what made me decide to quit altogether  One drink is no fun for me  so moderation is pointless  I've tried it  it never worked long term  when I drink I want to get drunk   Sucks to hear this about your friends  I have decided that I will have to find new friends to do new things with  I will keep in touch with existing friends  but we rarely did things together that didn't involve getting drunk   good for you for making it through it  I know what you mean  I'm a huge people pleaser so I would have thought the exact same way    that it was on me to make sure everyone else had fun at any cost  you did it  But that should be dopedope dope haha I will also be reading This Naked Mind this year  I hope it gives me some new perspective  I also find myself searching for reasons to drink by the evening time  My goal is to have a plan and stay busy so there is no flexibility  I will not drink with you today  Thanks for being there   Happy  sober New Year  Thanks everyone  And good luck to us all  You have advanced to LEVEL 2 of the Drinking Game   i e  you win  haha    Congratulations guys   Hey there  congratulations on your progress  Your eyes look bright and full of life    And I'm glad someone had a good 2016  It's always nice to hear good news  Ironically it was all the bad stuff that happened in my life this year that drove me to accept responsibility for myself and sober the fuck up  I'm hoping treatment will give me the insight needed to depend on myself to stay clean  Obviously doing it for another person isn't enough  There's too many variables involved  People are flaky and can't give you the necessary support 24 7  Checking in on my 5th day  The first day of 2017  Feeling a bit better this AM  Glad day 4 is in the past    I won't drink with you today   Thanks for the kind words  and I'm glad it made sense  They went so far as to offer us to stay the night  just being good hosts mind you   it was a total green light situation   I won't put myself in that situation again  I trusted myself and also my SO but I've learned that it's best to just not go  I'm very disappointed  I don't judge people for drinking so why am I judged for NOT drinking  It's craziness x I waited a little while  I listened carefully until I heard people share who had the kind of life I wanted  The person needed to be someone with years of recovery and active in the program  Of course  they had to have worked the steps  I think it was less urgent that I get a sponsor because my therapist was a recovering woman  so she answered a lot of my questions about AA  It took courage to ask someone to be my sponsor and not everyone I asked said "yes"  I just asked if they would help me work the steps  That's what I did    Happy New Year to you  too  Kudos for five days  It's a small thing  but I'm really happy that my 2 week badge lined up perfectly with New Years morning  I can't express how much this sub has helped me  You guys are the real mvps   3 I won't drink today no matter what happens good or bad  Thank you for the check in    Thanks slednek    A great start to the New Year  I'm  8 and I gave birth in February  You should see me on a regular year  2017 is already better yay  Greetings sensei  Can I be your sobriety padawan  Thank you  it feels like such a relief to have people relate   Level 2 involves opening the next bottle  Love your work mate  how much do you find the yoga helps with your anxiety  Thanks  Yoga is my anchor  Though I never did it under the influence  I'm looking forward to doing yoga with a clearer head and with alcohol fully out of my system  Cheers  Lemon  Sounds like a good night  You know I can never forgive you for actually living in NYC  but  meh  we all have our faults  you classy  Yankee bast ardent   Boutique to hit the liquor myself  Will match your scotch with a shot of 10 30 am vodka  Mad loves Happy New Year  I will not drink today  Yeah its like     woo     I'm the floatiest turd  Just kidding I fucking love this shitty cesspool I have a head cold  but  that's it  No hangover  no foggy memory  Waking up Christmas Eve  Christmas morning  and now New Year's Day  and all the days in between  without drinking the night before has been awesome  Happy New Year  Taking any sort of anti depressant  anti anxiety medication while being an active alcoholic is the same thing as taking medication for high cholesterol while eating a super sized burger and fries for every meal   Maybe the medication helps ward off worse symptoms for awhile  but it can't make you better   Still  by all means see a psychiatrist   They can be very helpful    RIGHT HERE  AND IT WAS HARD AS FUCK Don't scare me like that     Good for you  bring it on  You are not alone  When there is a family history of alcohol abuse it puts us at risk for alcoholism  I didn't want to accept that I had a problem either  but the evidence was just like yours  When I learned more about alcoholism  it helped me understand it  Reading  Under the Influence  by Ketchum and Milam had a major impact    It never gets better  only worse  You are not crazy   This is great  You can do this  one day at a time     Thanks so much and happy new year to you too  39    I didn't even consider it could've been that long  Thanks and Happy New Year  Chatting is a solid game  I play it every day  myself Okay will do and thanks   Wanted to keep it easy to track  Thanks  My drinking isn't bad enough to require medical intervention  I'm actually 4 days sober right now  Not cold sweats or headaches or anything like that   Thanks so much  I saw your day 4 post and almost didn't post mine because of the similarity  Thanks for the kind words and encouragement   I really do feel pretty good  but the energy is still missing  Taking lots of vitamins in an attempt to flood my body was something good for a change     Here's a video that sums up my feelings about opiates at the moment   https   www youtube com watch v 5FjWe31S 0g Sign me up  Sounds like a plan  Thanks so much  I'll chat your arse off  comrade  With you  I mean  that may sound like a joke  but that is seriously how I live my life  lolz  Good to see you on Not sure I know what a padawan is  but I understand sensei  I am just another drunken idiot who has figured out that my life is better without me intentionally altering my ability to think clearly  which is something I struggle with anyway   I learn from everyone  it is the best gift  Bottle of what exactly  Dear competitor  I'm motivated by all of the stories I've read here so I'm happy to have found a group like this  I will not drink today   happy 2017    Good luck u Direbrian  We're doing it  I will not drink with you today  profj77  I'm the weird aunt     pretty cool  Just glad to be an aunt    Much appreciated  Wishing you luck in return  It's all progress mate  consider it one cone in 6 days  bet that's a big improvement over how much you used to use right   Regarding your withdrawl symptoms I think only one cone shouldn't cause it to come back and I'd try not to focus on worrying about that too much  the anxiety itself can cause physical symptoms    You've got this and I'm proud of the progress you've made so far  We're all in this together to try and better ourselves  Woops  was a typo  but ya  that too For the next couple of weeks   r cripplingalcoholism

lucky to be mature enough to identify it now rather than later  I don't want to have to be driven to sobriety by waking up from a blackout with irreversible consequences  Thank you  I've been watching this subreddit for a while now and I feel motivated by reading all of the stories of success and support from others  Woke up early to go skiing this morning  Wouldn't have done that if I had drank last night  Happy New Years  Thank you so much  We'll do this together  Thank you   Good luck   Thank you  While hitting your bottom must have been heart wrenching you had the resolve to make the most of it   I salute you and your courage over the last year to take control of your life and to be there for both your Family and your own new path   I have had some spare time the last year    No worries  It's an uphill battle  Helluva New Year to ya  731 is kick ass  indeed  Thanks to people like you with a respectable amount of sobriety I feel empowered  Thank you  So I am married to an alcoholic  still drinking  not seeking help  in denial of his alcoholism   We have been married for over 3 and a half years  I only really found out about the nature of his drinking after a year and a half of marriage  We have a house together and have been together for 11 years    To be honest with you  if I knew what I know now back before we got married I wouldn't do it  I would've run  I feel so trapped at times because the idea of getting a divorce is just so huge   lawyers  splitting assets  getting our house ready to sell  selling our house  dividing the profits from the sale  having no where to go after we sold  struggling to buy a house in my state solo  having to tell all my family and friends  changing my name on all my documents  starting the dating life at nearly 30  etc    I cry all the time and worry about the future  I still love him but not sure if it's enough and I don't want to live my life like this forever  I want a family and a good relationship all the times not just at sober times    I'm sick of the lying and hiding of his drinking  finding bottles EVERYWHERE  being on completing different sleeping schedules  the moodiness that comes from his drinking  never abusive just sometimes cranky and rude   and the fact that sometimes I feel as if I hate him  At the moment he's going through a real rough patch at work  brought on by his drinking  and I feel as if I can't put my foot down until it's settled    Anyway sorry for the rambling long mess and to turn this into about me  my first comment on this sub reddit  and just needed to vent rant  but your post stuck with me and I basically felt like I was talking to myself from the past and what I would want to say    I wish you all the best that you can do the right thing for you and your circumstances  Thanks   January 30 is one year  On January 1st  I didn't have the slightest desire to stop but my general health have me a warning sign  This is amazing  great job all of you   I'm sure that this took a lot of effort  keep up the good work     Thank you so much   If I come to visit NYC   maybe in six nine months   will Lem let me sleep on the dirty kitchen floor  You're doing it wrong  We can get cheaper   1  Cheapest tequila you can find  2  T  J 'so margaritas mix   Done   It ain't good  but it gets the job done  You could consider asking someone to be a temporary sposor   That way you would have the support until you found someone who you wanted to be permanent  I'm confused   You seem to be saying that SSRIs are placebos that work "sometimes"   As in not just a placebo effect  they are actually medicinal   Though if that were true  they obviously wouldn't be placebos  Early in the morning  It's 1030  lem  p  Your night sounds far more impressive than mine    Crazy bitch wouldn't shut up  the one I mentioned the other day    Apparently now she's claiming to be in witness protection amongst other things like an "internal affairs investigation"  and I'm not entirely convinced she's not just repeating terms she heard in a episode of Law and Order   it rained  I avoided people  I heard fireworks all night but nothing worth going out for here in the middle of nowhere   Good luck   not today   Okay  I'm in  Your typos this morning are on point   A tiny piece will hardly have any THC in it so I wouldn't worry about that in regards to your homeostasis  and it wasn't intentional consumption so you're sticking strong which is great    Probably a bigger effect on your homeostasis is the second hand weed smoke  but it definitely depends on how hazy the room gets  IE hotboxing a room vs smelling a bit of a joint smoked outside  Which situation are you in  In time you'll find  as will others  that you are more witty and fun sober     Oftentimes someone else's reaction to our new sobriety is a defensive one that has more to do with their internal conflicts and justifications than anything to do with you    It's from Star Wars  A Jedi in training  Organisms are  literally  life  though    Orgasms are just life  metaphorically   Usually vodka but the store here seems to always be out  So rum   It sounds like you belong  Glad you came out of lurkdom  Stay in touch   Aren't new obsessions just fantastic    You love it     You watch fire works    You put it to bed   You don't even rape    But when IT really NEEDS you   you aren't there    So it LEAVES you    Even after you buy  12 Ramen     moved to tears   beautiful  thank you Alcohol increases anxiety  Seeing a doctor might be a good idea  I did     JustCAThings I will not drink today  Good morning  sobernauts   I received an envelope in the mail yesterday which I sat on the arm of my couch   The first thing I did this morning  after putting coffee in the press  was to gratefully open this wonderful card from u ninjilla that contained my   1 year chip     Heading into Year 2 and I will not drink today  I had the same fear   I thought stress and anxiety would destroy me  that getting drunk was all that kept that at bay    Funny thing is that after a couple of weeks  most of the stress and anxiety seemed to disappear   I still have stress and anxiety  but I realize now that the alcohol made it worse  not better   Hang in there  you can do this  I will not drink with you today     foreveralone 1 5 Millilitres  Are we in the chemistry lab measuring drinks with pipettes   Wow  thanks  but I am no Jedi  I don't even HAVE a Light Saber    In Sobriety  we are both just as far from a drink  We have today  Make the most of it  hit a meeting and hang out with some sober friends   If you do  you have improved your chances of going to sleep sober today  Checking in  Good luck everybody     Nice  Way to be able to be there for them    why would you have a lawyer for your first offence with weed   is it seen as a big offence in America  Checking in  Good luck everybody     Envious and proud my friend  How are you feeling  I'm on day 5 right now  It's funny how 2 weeks can fly by when your brain isn't focused on healing but I would kill to be at 13 instead of 5    Keep going   It's wonderful  I went to a close friends house last night to pop fireworks with the kids and hang out  She had her sister and other good friend  all of their spouses and like 2 children for every adult there ha   I expected them to drink  This can get to be a very rowdy crowd   At some point I just mildly asked "yall are not drinking tonight " And she said "no  we decided to make this about the kids tonight"   I was dumbfounded  When I was drinking   I could have neverrrrrrrr done that    I'm happy to be hangover free this morning though      That's why I'm trying this  I can't keep drinking to numb myself to the problems of the world  You're a good egg  that's such a nice thing to do     I would rather see someone do that ANY day than have them reluctantly get in some 'tipsy' driver's car  Im a great believer in luck  and I find the harder I work the more I have of it    Whether you consider the Thomas Jefferson  ascribed  or Peter Thiel version of the quote  it tends to be true    My Day 1 was Jan 1  2016  I white knuckled much of January  but it was through techniques I learned here that I was able to turn my sober January into a one day at a time approach  These include     Daily affirmation  "I will not drink today"  One day at a time    I deserve this for me  be kind to myself  feel some emotion    Messaging the nefarious nature of alcohol to myself  the alcohol marketing doesn't care about me  they just want to sell another bottle    See the little results  celebrate them  Do a touchdown dance     Dry people  dry places    Not wanting another Day 1 or to reset  FTZ  I wish you luck  but I also hope you'll embrace some of the strategies to make your own luck  These are some of the things that worked for me  finding what works for you to trick that evil lizard brain into a docile reptile will help immensely  As a very senior executive I used to work for was fond of saying  "Hope is not a strategy"   Best wishes in 2017  They get angry because they put up with our shit for so long  I can understand him  Maybe having a little talk with him could help  I can relate  Since I stopped drinking  I still stay up way too late on the regular  for no good reason  So I'm still frequently exhausted due to my own bad nonsense choices  but at least I'm not hungover from alcohol  feels a lot better that sleep deprived  and  hungover   Gonna keep trying  till I beat this burden    I will not drink today   pretty good  gota be honest it's festive period so i've had a few drinks here and there  sleep's still really all over the place  appetite come back with a vengence as has sex drive  a chance would be a fine thing    all in all i'm happy  not NA clean but this is what I want need  AFAIK  I'm always re evaluating though    Your EYES though  This is the number 1 change I am seeing in all these wonderful pictures  Your eyes literally look bigger  Less bags  You de aged  Placebos do work  as you've noted it's called the placebo effect    Active placebos are even more effective  as they have side effects that help convince people that they're working    Like how soap makes suds or dandruff shampoo tingles    The suds and tingling effect do absolutely nothing except make people believe they're working    Actual medicine  as you put it  has to have a success rate greater than placebos in a trial    SSRIs simply do not meet this criteria    It's not my opinion  it's just what meta analysis of the trials tells us  thanks  yeah it's a lifetime  may as well be    congrats on a month  Haha  have a good morning buzz going  didn't even realize that was a typo  lolz  But ya  sure  I will stand by it Thank you x  How many times do I have to disgust and alienate people before I realise that I need to sort myself out     Zero    The change starts today  if you want it to  You can do it  Same here  kinda    Myself and my girlfriend had a night of watching Harry Potter and making gourmet cheeseburgers    Was tempted to have a whisky at midnight but fought the urge  because I knew that would turn into me drinking until 6am    Went to sleep about 1am after watching some drunks fight on my road  Had an epic lie in until 12 30pm  Now I've overslept and feel hungover   The reason I'm a raging alcoholic is because I'm anxious  It's my way of self medicating  Perhaps if I was taking something for my anxiety I could cut back on my boozing  I want to see a psychiatrist  but idk what they even ask you  or what to even talk about   Happy New York to you  Lemmy  Looking forward to the continuing saga   If you're questioning something in your behaviour  then you definitely have a problem  You may not have a life wrecking addiction  but it's usually only a matter of time if the problem isn't addressed   I'm glad you're here  You have come to a really good  supportive place  Great job  And Happy New Year  One thing that helped me is for BOTH of us to be blindfolded  It makes it really intimate because you are navigating and responding by touch  and at least for me I worried so much less about what I looked like  Part of this is that it will just be HARD  but the only way things get more comfortable is by practice  It will also get easier as you become more comfortable with your body in general  You might also try to focus on emotional intimacy with your partner   anything that will help you to trust that your partner loves and wants to be with YOU  regardless of what your body looks like  Sorry you are struggling with this    I will not drink today  Not drinking last night was no big deal  thankfully  I was asked why I wasn't drinking  but my response about why was accepted readily  Phew  Welcome Direbrian  I will not drink with you today  Today is an important day for us all  I believe setting intentions can drastically change our lives and out looks    Today I start taking care of myself for the better  Food becomes fuel  Alcohol is out of the question for me   I will not drink with you all today  Alright I'll bring a spare bivvie bag  Look at you being all global oriented with your metric references  How much is 3ml  I thought there was like 40ml in a shot  Checking in Thanks  I will not drink today  no matter what happens  unfortunately  in a lot of states  yes  The 2nd one  one spliff in a room  but as soon as I realised the "danger" I started smoking cigarette after cigarette and holding it under my nose the whole time until they were done and then left   couldn't leave earlier  Also I dodn't sit in the middle but on the end of the couch   Also   for that little piece in my tobacco  I searched through my whole tobacco to check and found nothing  So in the terms of size  if there was even a bit  it was the size of a piece  of dust  It's all good    Orgasms create organisms so it's all connected anyway   Same here  It's a wonderful feeling  "When was the last time you drank and had that warm image  Prob ten years ago  the real image is me not enjoying a drink  but of one of obsession  as soon as it enters past my lips it turns to obsession  in how much and how quick I can drink  I don't feel warm  I feel cold  makes me feel cloudy  moody  unsociable  and then there is the morning after  the disappointment  the headache  the blackout  the shakes  the intense anxiety  the sweating  and most of all the guilt and fear  "  Exactly  I kept trying to chase the amazing  freeing  happy feeling I had early on in my drinking  I know it was an illusion  but it felt great  Honestly  if I had continued to feel like that  I don't think I could have quit  I would probably rather have drank myself to death  But the thing is  it's not that way anymore  It sucks  It's dark  It hasn't been that way for a long time  Years  maybe a decade  It just didn't occur to me that  sobriety  of all things was the answer  I had a compulsion to keep trying drinking  to get it to work again  I will not drink today  Happy New Year  everyone   I was celebrating New Years Day with my girlfriend sober too     That wasn't even a game  just like a practice scrimmage with a junior team  Heck  Arsenal CP even looks like a better matched game  I admire your resolve  How did your friend respond to you pulling her aside  Fantastic  watched LOTR with a few cuppa  stay lit lads  It took me a while and a wife  who can drink normally  to support my decision    Have a great 17  This sub has been a daily stop since the beginning   I also got through part of the holiday season without drinking  as my badge will tell you  I stopped right before Christmas   Here's to a sober 2017  Thats crazy  I was caught here in the UK with a 20 bag and we get a caution for the first offence  if its cannabis and providing it's personal so under like an oz  then if you get caught again your ordered to pay a fine of around 80 then if your caught a 3rd time you go to court and get given some stupid community service  Good luck anyhow bro Welcome aboard  I will not drink with you today   That is a great story  It is amazing how freeing it is to not worry if you can drive or not  I could not begin to tell you how many times the SO was cooking while we were drunk and I would say do not cut your finger or I will have to call an ambulance because I can not drive  Or just simple things like oh we are out of this or that I will just run to the store  Good on you for feeling the power of not drinking  Yeah that's the thing  I've started lying about drinking  I'm seeing someone that barely drinks  which Is great for me  and the other day I thought about hiding my half gone wine bottle  He's never said anything about my drinking   however I obviously am insecure about it  That's not ok   I'm right there with you  As soon as I have the first one  I want another one  and then probably another one  As is often said on this sub  all you have to do is avoid one drink  the first one  Got really drunk last night  So sad right now  I will not drink today  Eh  ring and ceremony aren't really necessary  I got married in front of a judge without buying anything other than the certificate  Wife wears a ring her mother gave her  and I don't even have a wedding band     Who's spreading cheer this new year   Jax is   "But I can't say it because once I admit to it it means that I can never drink again and that is a scary prospect for me " That was how I felt  too  I know it's really hard  especially when everyone around you drinks  You're ahead of the game in recognizing that it's an issue  All I can say is I wish that I'd quit at age 22  I think the best thing about not drinking  for me  has been being able to  live  without constantly thinking about how and when I was going to get to drink again  Even when I wasn't drunk  I was obsessed with drinking at a later time  and it stopped me from really experiencing things  Hey man  could you please tell me what were your reasons for kicking LSD  I'm really interested  because I was considering trying it  but maybe I shouldn't because recently I came to a conclusion that weed causes me some weird derealization depersonalization that really messes with me  so perhaps I should avoid LSD until I'm in a place where I'm more stable and content   Sorry dude  just really interested  please reply either here or pm me if you can  thanks  I'm predicting good things for drunks this upcoming year   I expect this to be the year of "what the fuck" as outrage and disbelief will be useless in trying to comprehend the mindset that will explain the many actions of Prez Carrot and his rapacious companions       Given their antics  every drunk will have the ready excuse   I may be a falling down  useless drunk  but at least I'm not doing       let your imaginations wander        It allows one's drunken lazy ass to be seen as a minor transgression in comparison and provides a quick secondary target that your accuser can direct their disgust and venom against     But if it isn't my kitchen floor  wtf did I have to clean up the broken bong   How much is this TJ  Trader Joe's   mix    I don't buy mixes anymore cause  besides typically drinking my booze straight  they're a waste of money    Simple syrup is made from just disolving a cup of sugar in a cup of water and heating it till it's disolved  only costs what the sugar does    And the mexican mart by me sells 15 limes for  1  or there's always the store brand lime juice for  2  Who's spreading the realism    Jax is  If you don't mind me saying  It kind of seems like you are trying to find the next best thing after you quit something  And that's not a dig at you because I am he same way   When t comes down to it  You got to just go through it without anything for a while  Or you will always be searching for the next best thing   And you will feel kind of crazy like that for a while and it sucks  I'm over 60 days and I'm still moody and get hopeless    but I keep pushing  Because I don't want to be miserable anymore because of substances  I don't want to get fired from anymore jobs  I don't want to be unreliable  I want to be a good person  a good friend  and a hard worker again   sign me up I definitely wouldn't worry about that miniscule bit you smoked then  But if you're worried about any THC consumption being around second hand smoke does expose you to some  no where near as much as actually smoking but a little  Smoking the cigarettes will cover the smell but it will still be in the air    At the end of the day is it enough exposure to worry about  Probably not  but you do seem very vigilant about not having any THC at all  Maybe try and leave the room if people are smoking  Or get them to smoke outside  Try and find a method that will work for you  my anxiety is so much more manageable now  i know it is scary  but i promise it helps so much in every aspect of your life to be sober   Good luck mate       My advice  Just for a bit distance from your pals who are also smokers in the first week or two and don't tell anyone about your decision to quit  i found it easier myself to not share it with anyone until I had a good grasp on it     Best of luck     Craved a drink last night  but made the pledge  woke up sober  7th day today  And I will not drink today  Sex  Yeah that's when I first started thinking 'ehhhh this isn't normal'  when I would dispose of my bottles separately from my normal trash  when nobody could see   Or like  when I would say 'oh no  not drinking tonight'  and then sneak a bottle of wine in   Took me a while to realise that whilst the behaviour was brought on by external factors in my life  it wasn't normal and needed fixing  Lol  oh shit  meant to write ounces    My brain is still recovering from yesterday    I did not drive my own ass home  so I'm still feeling like a winner  even if I can't write properly anymore  omg  hangxiety is the best word ever  thank you for that    happy new year  I fucked that up  edited it now   There 45ml in an US shot I believe     It's day 7 for me and last night was rough as my wife went out  I'm still in that phase where  i think my body expects me to be hungover  so I woke up feeling shitty  By the time I reached the bottom of my stairs  my brain kicked in   "wait  your sober    awesome " It's President Cheeto to you  Mr  Canuck    Christ  I feel like time is slipping away until he nukes us    She wanted to see the ball drop  Eight hours penned into a literal cage   Yeah  no  We drink  Doesn't work that way    Psst  come here  Let's hit the roof  Be pissy  just trust me    I'm awe struck Dev Kit  It's why I came home  Etch A Sketch'd anything I've experienced with "what's her lips "  This will either be the best thing ever or the new end of everything   Did you have a good NY  I ended up staying in    Gotta keep my desperation in check    Time for a rub   tug   For the next

Welcome  Bast ardent   I'll allow it   Hey man  just lurking through this sub and I saw this and I felt the need to comment  I don't know what state you're in  and everyone has different laws  but when I got in trouble I don't think you need a lawyer  You just go in front of the judge  and in m state the first offense was 6 months probation  just don't get in trouble with the law at all   and drug classes  It was all around  700  Best of luck with everything  Like 1030 ain't early for the unemployed drunks   Thanks   No worries  where I would be going there is no bail     I will not drink

will not drink today  sign me up I reset my badge at least twice last year  Always lots of support here on SD  I will not drink with you today  C'mon Jax  Lem turns his shit up to 11 and you'll swoon

day in patient detox and 6 months of residential rehab to kick them  been off them for about 18 months    I checked out that website and unfortunately it seems to mainly mainly a USA thing  there's only a handful of meetings in England  none of which are near me  It sounds good though    Today's been hard  I feel like the mental side is really kicking in now  got up and drank some coffee and my head was filled with about 9 months of kratom fuelled regret    Forced myself to get on my bike and somehow cycled 20 miles  feel better for it now but it was hard work  my heads full of what ifs and could have beens    I feel like I've duped loads of people  all this time I've been using I've been making out like I was clean  I justified it to myself at the time because it wasn't valium  but it's still not right I feel  sign me up I realized I had a drinking problem around aged 24  I was married to my FIRST husband who had a similar mind set as yours  Id gently prod about quitting drinking and he'd start whining that we wouldn't be able to go play pool together and have a good time anymore  In the same breath hed bitch about my daily beer drinking habits and ask me to just quit THAT instead  This went on quite often  Long story short  I'm 34 now and didn't quit drinking until last may  I'm however married to a man that was "only" a best friend now  We split up because I realized he actually wasn't supportive of a damn thing I wanted to do   I wish I would have quit sooner      2017  Now With Less Rape     Haha it's okay  p I was just imagining this drink being mixed in a spoon

bed sober tonight   I will not drink today  I intend to keep it up  creativity been huge for me over the last year or so  don't know where I'd be without it  Thank you  Thank you Ripster  You'll be with us soon enough    Checking in  Not drinking for at least the next 24 hours  so until 8 12 a m  on January 2  2017  That's why your so fucking weary of me  Today was pretty bad  my heads been non

communicating and see what happens  In the meantime  I won't drink with you today  it's a great feeling  congrats  I just went over to my parents    It was fun  I mean for me anyways  but I'm kind of getting old and boring    They took everyone to see Rogue One  which I was kinda getting worried I'd never see in the theatre  bought a few fireworks  which I burned myself lighting  and we had galubkis for dinner    Then it was just drinking and listening to music till I blacked out     Happy New Year Lee  Hey man I know that feeling  Why don't you try and accept that you don't have the motivation to do anything but don't smoke that bowl  Just do something mind numbing like watch TV or whatever you normally do high  Eventually that motivation will come back but it takes time  I will not drink with you today  Reddit  Yes    which is why you use beer and not liquor   p I will not drink with you today  Reddit  Congratulations on your 365   I just hit mine this morning as well  Seems like such a short time  but also seems like a long time as well  In the beginning I didn't think it'd be possible  but as time went on I was surprised how simple it's become  Just seems like another thing I do  or don't do  rather   Way to go  and I hope you continue  one day at a time   I was not scheduled to work today but my ass was still up way too goddamn early  '   Hey    I just creeped your shit congratulations on the 7 days     Thanks for hosting  Happy to not drink with you today  Happy to not drink with the rest of you today too  Peace  i've read similar things about the relationship between gut flora and the brain   you are what you eat  and what you don't excrete   It was hard but I'm so happy I split with my alcoholic ex  Ever thought of doing that   I'm still angry  though   Good for you    I was thinking about it yesterday how bad I had gotten before I quit drinking  How I was not ever really sober but maybe   If my BAC lowered when I was sleeping  Then I'd wake and immediately add fuel back to my blood  I don't think I was really sober that often towards the end at all    Man it feels great to feel great today  I will not drink with you all  As the turns world   I won't drink today  it really is a happy new year  Not yet  I'm not sure anyone wants to take me on    Weary    Send nudes   This helps a ton  I'm constantly questioning my choice to go sober  "It just pot" I keep hearing in my head  It's long weekend days like this when I cave  but I'm going to hold on  Thanks Reddit  I am not scheduled to work either  Congrats to you   My last cig was 10 30 and I haven't had a single puff since  As you know it just keeps getting easier  I can't wait to hit a full year in 2017  I kind of wanted to get pulled over driving home at 3am lol  It's an awesome app and totally helped me pull through  Whenever you feel tempted open the app and remind yourself why you're quitting and give yourself a pat on the back for how far you've come  The first month will be difficult but I PROMISE it gets easier and easier  The cravings only last minutes and then they're gone   Also one other thing that helped me was carbonated water like San Pellegrino     sounds weird I know  But the carbonation gives a bit of a burning sensation when you drink it and for me was somehow satisfying  Hope this helps   I tried it  and it was a poor substitute for me  I found it wasn't satisfying  even on high nicotine  I used it more compulsively than cigarettes  Eventually the thing started malfunctioning and I just went back to smoking    Health effects haven't been studied much yet  but inhaling synthetic oil vapor deep into your lungs can't be good for you  I know a couple people who've had popcorn lung from it  Most people I know who vape still continue to smoke    The only thing that worked for me was joining a support group  I looked up nicotine anonymous which really helped  Something like that could help you too maybe   Dang  Very inspiring  Happy new year  You're all like      " OH   let's not talk to this narc anymore "   But I'm here   and you know I'm here    Don't that just make your skin fucking crawl  Too late to sign up  Would like to be on the list some salt in some step to make it right   Yeah I completely understand  You're doing well  keep it up  Each day that passes I slowly feel better and better  The resetting definitely takes some time  Checking in  Yes  I'm definitely just looking at the short term  You'll find a lot to think about and keep you busy in treatment  You'll also find the support you need    Right now I'm just trying to help you find a few things to keep you occupied and motivated  You just need to make it to treatment  For now  I survived the Eve  and will continue to not drink today Huge congratulations  I hope you're just beaming at waking up fresh to a new year    My own story is a bit different but I really identify with how severe and awful it sounds like it got for you    With you sober today New York sounds cool  but as a European  we often hear about how it is a cesspool of crime and urine smell    So which is it  I thought NY was pretty safe these days  is that true  My manager called me because a coworker called in    I did not answer  They do not pay me enough to walk all the way there and back on my day off with 10 minutes notice   Really hoping this year will be the year I can finally make it and become "clean"   Best of luck to all of you  As a lurker on Reddit for years I finally created an account to post here  I woke up sober and I won't drink today  Starting the New Year off right  I will not drink today  Did it  Congrats to everyone else  Holy Cow  you look great  we can do it    Very very safe these days    It's kind of a police state if you can fall into the warmth of M16's in the port authority   That's not a bad idea  although I gotta watch my salt intake so I don't add salt to hardly anything these days  If you're only having sex with her when she's sober  you're not enabling her  But there might be other concerns besides that  like how she feels about it and how you feel about it   maybe having a sexual relationship would hurt you more if she relapsed again   Sober only sex can be a great reward to someone who's struggling to choose between using and sobriety  But obviously her personal feelings on the matter trump the reward  as do yours   So it's really up to the both of you  Best of luck   3  Haha  working with a new tablet here and some good drugs  CUT ME SOME SLACK  LEMME  GEEZER  LOLZ  Hey  welcome  We are so glad to have you  I don't think I would have made it this far without this sub   I won't drink with you today  Happy new year    I also found New Years to be challenging and mildly depressing  And I spent it completely alone also    If you look down toward the bottom of the sidebar there is a sober IRC Chatroom  a lot of people were on over New Years helping each other out  Feel free to drop in some time     Happy 2017  Nah  I got Dewars for breakfast  First time in LONG time    My skin crawls over a "certain" narc  but not you   I will not drink today   So    here goes nothing  I guess   How about here goes everything  instead  and jump in whole heartedly  You have made the first and most important step already  you made a decision that stopping drinking will improve your life  Not drinking with you today    Hear hear   I'm not sure what my going rate is "to walk "  Way more than anyone would pay   That sounds like a great night  I avoid movie theaters  Too expensive for something I'll either fall asleep during or just completely forget in the end    Let's do this  Yes  you're right   what a great feeling not to have to worry about the simple things  like running up to the store   Thanks Guitarist  That brings back memories    I used to have a really cool custom made glass spoon back when I was doing that    SO was always bitching that I was ruining our metal spoons so I had my glassblower friend make me one  The last line made me giggle a little  Good for you  I'm hoping to gain the same inspiration from sub     I shall fear no longer   My family have been pretty incredible unsupportive about me getting sober  At a certain point you are getting sober for you and not them  just keep sober and let the results speak for themselves   HAPPY SOBER NEW YEAR to all my fellows at SD  I made it   I'm starting this new year with over six months of sobriety and that is the better surplus I've gotten in the last years   I won't drink with you today to give a good start to this 2017  Thank you so much  This is so incredibly helpful for me  I've never dealt with something like this  and I really appreciate the insight  The codependency thing definitely resonates  so I will definitely read that book  Yes  they were wise to call and I was glad to be there   Absolutely better than the 'tipsy' or smashed driver     Thanks CountryStyle    New Year's Eve is a bit different but I've found in general most people don't care  and those that do generally have an underlying reason for it  Again  NYE is a special case  but I tend to say I'm driving or talk about vague health reasons   I will not drink alcohol today      mhmmm   and that's why you won't talk to me    Jax is dangerous      Oh  I miss understood  Carry on  TJ'so is just cheap margarita mix  down south  Definitely not from trader Joes    But ya  I normally roll with straight vodka or maybe some bright and early  sorta kinda of  lolz I love this thread  I also woke up with a smile  not a drop of alcohol last night and I feel fabulous today   So happy there are tears in my eyes   A lot of people fail to realize that a million dollar view often requires distance from what you want to look at       I lived in one hovel with a huge unobstructed view of the complete downtown Van with ocean  stadiums  buildings   Another illegal loft place far enough where the Toronto skyline was framed every evening       My current bolthole piece of crap provides snow covered mountains seen by simply glancing up from my computer       Good christ   there is actually fucking snow still on the ground   a new year's miracle   Snow rarely lasts any length here  and winter is officially over by mid January in this part of the city        Who knows how it will play out  You might not have been an adult when Reagan came to power  but trust me  people were equally as freaked out by his arrival      It wasn't a complete accident that period saw some of the largest anti nuke demonstrations ever   No one was quite sure what he was going to do  perhaps he would get confused and think he was playing a movie when ordering a launch  or it was his role to lead everyone to Jesus        To be fair  just because we survived one doesn't mean we will necessarily survive his 2nd coming  The one thing I've never experienced are the sweats in the am  I will only sweat profusely if I'm taking a sober day and it only happens when I'm sleeping    It sucks  Wet bedsheets aren't fun  Nice to have you  I won't drink with you today   Thanks for the support  I'm feeling the same way  Wait  are you saying I reset it or not  I'm not sure I follow   Edit  I guess you mean resetting our brains take some time x  We separated this fall and he moved in with his parents for several months   It was blissful here with my kids   We were so peaceful and happy   Then he moved back in under the guise of wanting things to work out   He is living in the spare bedroom and still drinking and taking pills   He is meaner than a mad snake and we are all living under enormous stress   It is very very bad here   And according to him  it's all my fault   I can't communicate with him because he is always  ALWAYS wasted   Always   And he lies about it constantly even with the empties  cans and pill bottles  lying around   He lies   He qualifies   He blames   And I am angry  Thank you  I'm not terribly enthusiastic right now  which is probably due to being hungover  hopefully for the last time   But I know things will change as I re learn to live my life without alcohol     Congratulations  You guys rock  Although I didn't make it all the way through 2016  being a part of this challenge was a tremendous source of motivation to me in my journey towards being porn free  It's great to see people on here kicking some serious porn free ass  You all are an inspiration  Looking forward to 2017  Thanks for the suggestion  but I think that "victor" is correct   I did defeat an enemy in 2016  My enemy is not the others on the list  they are my friends and bothers and sisters  not my enemies   and not the challenge itself   My enemy is the part of me that loves porn and drugs and other forms of escape   I don't think this entailed heroism  just tenacity and planning and thought   And let me tell you  if I can do it everyone here can do it  I was an angry BO  daily drunk for over 2 years  I gave up on apologizing or giving a shit for a bit  I still have all of my friends  I call that    magic   How to make a Margarita  https   m youtube com watch v ulnDMwd80SU  Back at have  boss    Yup  there is a good amount of studies out there  During the time that I was using  I always stayed "regular"  Since stopping I only had 1 SERIOUSLY rough morning of BMs  Other than that    just a typical morning shit  I know that's probably TMI  Hey  if it might be able to help someone endure    that's enough for me    I'm really particular about what goes into my body food supplement wise   I guess I put those fucking opiates in there too  I can really attest to the vitamins probiotic help on the physical aspect of withdrawal  The mental game is a little different but like you said    you are what you eat  It definitely can't slow down the healing process by trying to eat supplement in a healthy way   atcha What a great way to start the New Year  Solid post my man  Kudos on your 3 days  LOVE THIS    I was a new years resolutioner back in 2014 and got to 19 months before I decided that the proper  urban mom thing to do was to have that one glass of wine per week after the 1st trimester just to "stick it to the puritanical man " I  too  was back to drinking regularly pretty quickly after my second daughter was born  with "dark beer" being the proper thing to load up on  for the milk  of course   I got back on the wagon 86 days ago and can empirically confirm that the grass is SO much greener on the sober side  The person who commented on your Imgur  what a bunch of asses  over there  btw   and said "not an easy road to walk"  I was like "oh  how wrong you are    " Once you know how awesome sober life is  the struggle goes away  at least it does for me   so I always kind of roll my eyes at the "oh  what a painful  horrible  terrible thing you've had to do" type posts    Git after it in 2017  girl    Checking in   Oh good lord    Sorry  I'm all infatuated and shit   Yeah  but public transit here is shit so that would be my option today  No one was awake to give me a ride at 9   I don't mind doing it occasionally  like yesterday afternoon    But there and back again today  Nope  y'all aren't paying me enough   I was stuck on the HP thing for a few years   now identify with a spirit of the universe   I haven't formulated it perfectly and have a hard time putting it into words but when I speak to my HP I feel I'm speaking to that spirit   I didn't believe in it for a while but did it out of desperation and the truth is that's when I started seeing results     I guess I've come to find out  for me  that taking the actions of the program  even when I don't believe in them  has worked   And I'm completely over trying to explain that to myself because I can make no sense of it  Oh wow  how fancy    I used bottle caps a lot  lol  Disposable and easier to explain than carrying around a spoon   i plan on throwing some light exercise and alot of stretching into my morning routine  That and drinking a good amount of water should be a great way to get my body ready for the day  rather than fapping and dumping caffeine into my body as I would usually do with any amount of free time in the morning  Congratulations on not trying to "squeeze" one in though  Heh just tape it together  I doubt anyone will notice  What an inspirational person  Thank you  I love the quote  Congratulations on your progress  so far   Came of age with Reagan    Saw HW Bush speak at the mall I worked in    Agreed  history may repeat itself   but the populace just gets dumber    Really  Dev Kit    I just wish these kids would get off my lawn     Who am I kidding   I'm deep in no lawn NYC and couch surfing   Cheers from my 2nd Scotch Thank you    I know  it isn't really until hindsight kicks in  and mine is still relatively infant  yet still potent  that you realise how little time was spent sober  Or for at least any great length of time    Maybe it would only be one drink  so I was still in some sense of the word 'sober' but that one drink was enough for my romanticising of alcohol to be ignited  To be awakened and hungry for more    In the morning when I woke up and in the hours up until I next had a drink I never appreciated just   being    I would close my eyes on the tube and try get 15 minutes respite because I felt so groggy instead of reading like I used to    I'd not take note of anything that was around me  Not appreciate where I was and the fact I was alive    I'd ignore phone calls from my mum in my 'hungover' days and bail on plans I'd made with friends  silencing their calls when they came in and not listening to their voicemails asking where I was  I'd eventually reply saying I was ill or too tired from work  But I wasn't too tired or to ill to still drink at home alone that night was I    How is that a life I was proud of  And I was proud   I'd be proud to quote how long it had been since I'd last worked a shift and not had a drink  What a fool   Thank you for your comment and well done on such a long time   Checking in  I'm so hung over from New Year's Eve  I completely agree  movies are too expensive for me   And usually garbage    I hardly ever go  but they were treating and it was Star Wars  so I wasn't about to say no    Left to my own devices I would have just stayed at home drinking  watching my poor sick woman play Final Fantasy XV  So I wouldn't carry you to work and home on my back   But I  might  eat the corn out of your shit    Congratulations brothers  And happy new year  Onward to 2017  Know that you shouldn't blame yourselves for your dad's behavior here  Know that  especially assuming you're young  he should be trying to protect you and listen to your honesty rather than shunning it  But also know that he's human and ashamed of her behavior  and ashamed of his ability to prevent it  If he were more mature he would behave differently  but that's his limit  It's not right or fair  and it's not healthy for you and your sister  If you're mad at him  you don't have to forgive him  but remembering to see what's going on can help you empathize with both him and yourself  Yourself most importantly  you don't deserve this   If you're up to it  maybe you could ask him if the four  or at least three  of you can go to therapy together  Any therapist might help  but one who knows about  CRAFT  https   en wikipedia org wiki Community reinforcement approach and family training  or has a generally more modern view of addiction will be better  Love and luck to all of you  Congratulations   I'm on 7 and am normalizing as well     shattered with resin everywhere     What does 2017 hold   BONG SHOPPING  Great work  guys  Congrats  Haha  I hear you    I made and ate SO MUCH FOOD last night  No regrets though  Never got a hangover from too much to eat    The bruises  I was constantly being asked  "what did you DO " Never had a clue    Meth can sort of vaguely look like salt  Rim the glass with that instead      shittyLPTs What is it they say    the more often you try  the more likely you are to succeed  Something like that  So great job trying again  I'm on my second reset  and while I'd like be perfect  I'd rather be sober  I will not drink with you today  And Happy New Year to you  Checking in  not gonna be about that porn life this year  Checking in on day 1  Happy new year     I made it   Sat 3 feet from a guy toking on a one hitter  too   Didn't even drink all that much  just enough to celebrate the coming of the new year and that was it    My go to lately has been "I'm just happier and healthier without it" which is utterly true and if they continue to press I ask why they're looking for something negative which pushes it back on to them to defend THEIR behavior as opposed to you defending yours  Checking in  Let's go 2017   D Your skin will heal in time  but that kid will always be an asshole  Hahaha      Smile Lemmy   I'm playing    But answer a Pm once in awhile   cunt   Woo  It's what I was looking forward to as I fell asleep last night     Hair of the dog for me  some black tea to fight off the caffeine hangover  I'm three weeks in and feel pretty good  Nice to wake up this way  Was a pretty cool and productive last few days  totally agree  i was like clockwork as well during using days  since stopping subs I had one day of like brown steam  since we're already beyond the TMI point  but otherwise I'm good   don't have money for probiotics at moment though  flat broke    Angry   no  I find being drunk makes me a far more efficient  friendly and entertaining person  Some of the best decisions I ever made were when smashed to oblivion  The solution to your problem is quite clear   'Don't be a Dick'  We have to make mistakes to make progress  But coming on here and justifying your mistake isn't the right mindset to be in  What makes it hard to just do the same thing 11 days from now again   Best of luck to you   stay strong  and realize if you have an addition  there is no middle ground  That's not how it works  There's another sub for that if you want to be a casual smoker  How oddly specific        porn is  just a time suck   Yes it is   And that's a negative consequence of your porn use  because time is our most valuable resource   Addiction is defined as increasing a behavior over time in the face of negative consequences  and not being able to moderate or quit when you want to      Here are some tips for you   https   www reddit com r pornfree comments 2mfxyi concrete tips for staying away from porn    Not really a step by step guide to quitting   if you want that  look into the 12 step programs or other resources listed at the bottom of that page     I believe it  and I'm starting to believe that BSO is a must have  Lol the imgur comments are silly  I realize I take that risk just being a woman and posting so I don't sweat it  Par for the course  It's great to hear you're back st it  My fear is I get comfortable   I feel like I have a "handle" on things and that the proper thing for me to do is to start drinking again   as to show everyone that I'm "normal" like them  My hope is of my lizard brain ever kicks in I'll have the strength to get back on the horse like you've done  Congrats to you and happy New Years to you and your family   r redditorsinrecovery The health effects of vaping haven't been studied long enough but the medical community generally thinks it's about 90  safer than smoking  Obviously inhaling vapor isn't "good" for you but it is undoubtedly better than inhaling carcinogens    Vaping also eliminates addictive  non nicotine  chemicals that are present in cigarettes  like acetaldehyde  Not to mention breaking up some of the mental rituals associated with smoking  for example fondness for a certain brand   Vaping really helped me quit in the early going  Even the first few weeks there's no way I vaped as much as I had smoked and over time I just gradually tapered down to the point where now I only really do it while drinking  If I had to quit it forever tomorrow I easily could  I never bring the vape or gum to work and it's just sort of there as an option if I need it   There's really no reason to avoid NRT if that's going to be the difference between quitting vs not quitting cigarettes   Thanks a bunch and the very same right back at you on 4  Feeling good  right now at least    Bravo for 901 days   u mnhoops                        Thanks for your helpful  inspirational post  It gives hope and guidance to others   I will not drink poison today I was in a casino and there was the smell of weed everywhere  I went home  thought "man  I'd love to smoke right now"  and very easily could have  Didn't cave though   so glad    I've been on fire lately with my side projects  Making some great progress  and to me this new year is just another day on the grind  A lot of people are taking today off  I'm getting right to work  hungover or not   I still get the old image from time to time  usually passes in a minute or so  it's like watching Harry Potter the first film where it's all warm and magical  but in reality it developed into the last few films where it's all dark and twisted   She was fine after that  I was just trying to avoid telling everyone I'm an alcoholic so it was embarrassing for me to have to say I can't handle a sip  She was a little embarrassed but very understanding   Congrats on your year    Sober wishes for your new year as well  We got dis  Living the life    The spoon broke but I still have a glass pill smoosher somewhere  and a little bubbler that he made me     We used to hit up the local headshops and try to sell his stuff so we could buy meth    We made a good team    He had a ton of connections  and I kept him from doing stupid shit    Unfortunately he passed last year    I meant to go to the funeral but got drunk instead    Edit  How do you not burn the fuck out of your fingers with a bottle cap  I have the same sleep appetite issues   Eating very small meals  even if it's just a couple of bites every now and then  helps a lot   Things that are easy on the stomach  broth soups  help a lot   Warm water with lemon first thing in the morning helps   Avoiding coffee helps  this one also helps for sleep    As far as sleeping  for me it helps if I go to sleep as soon as I'm tired  even if it's early   Staying off my phone helps me fall asleep faster  also reading at night     Hope some of these help you     Bravo f  or your sobriety  Hope your new year is sober and happy  Aw    been there     Sorry it's late but sign me up    Like  I know that's philosophically true  but  meh  I just want to be married for some reason  I want the ceremony and shit  I'very had plenty of gf'so  I want the short hand  I want to say this one is my wife   My parents wear 2 brass rings  And they make money now  and I don't know  I just want that  I want a wife    I know it doesn't really mean anything  But Ive always been so broke  I could never actually do it  But if I can  I really want to  Thank you  It was so nice to feel like I got "myself" back  Congrats on your day 1  Keep it going  And I even envy you for your unpleasant side effects   Quitting Kratom after 6 long years was sooo hard for me    Good for you  To a sober 2017 one day at a time  No traffic  no headache  no nausea  grabbed breakfast and watching a movie relaxing  It's a great feeling being sober this morning  Fuck that  tape shopping  Consider it a puzzle to reassemble  Congrats on all the progress and thanks for the encouragement inspiration  It was exactly what I needed right now  Happy 2017  Yessss    so many bad things before my decision to quit  My last event was just a catalyst  Best wishes for your journey  I'm inordinately happy to have made the list  Really shouldn't be this happy about fake internet points but the people in this community make them actually worth something  Yeeeeee let's do it   I will join everyone here in not drinking today  I have a thing for corn  Sue me   I don't get sick that frequently  and when I do  it doesn't hit me very hard  Of course  I've also been picking since I was 5  so maybe my immune system has just compensated  Thank you for your feedback   However I want to clarify that this post was 1  not about justifying myself  it was about not considering every step back a failure  and hopefully stop someone who might have been through the same thing from beating themselves up  because that doesn't help  and 2  not about being a casual smoker  but rather reiterating that quitting does not happen for everyone in one straight line   I quit smoking cigarettes four years ago  but it did not happen in one go   It took a lot of phases and stages to get to where I am now  which has been completely  cigarette  smoke free for four years     Happy new year   I feel ya  they are a grip for sure  What have you been doing so far in recovery now that you're almost at the 2 week mark  Hell ya  Porn is fucked up    enough is enough  right    Keep up the good work  you got this   I posted about  a similar situation  Very close friend last night was pressing me to have a drink  I finally asked to talk to her privately and told her that I have a problem with drinking and I'm trying to stop and that her behavior is making it very hard for me  She understood and stopped and the rest of the night was fine  It's shocking how many people will push others to drink so they won't feel bad about themselves  I'm pretty sure I did it myself   Anyway  good job on staying strong  And congrats on the pregnancy haha   Rebellions are built on hope   Cassian Andor   Seriously though  hope is a powerful tool  Best wishes   Well done  I've not smoked since the 30th of September 2016  60 days was HUGE for me  I was like "whoa I can do this      " Congrats to you keep going  Now that She's gone and I'm focused on Her  I smile a lot more    Now if I could bust a nut    Interesting  It never occurred to me like that   Long gone by now my friend    Hated that bong anyway   Use the force      I'm an atheist and my higher power keeps evolving   It started as and still is GOD  group of drunks    My constant contact with a higher power was just going to meetings  working the steps  talking to other alcoholics etc  Its a little more than that now because I'm trying to get more spiritual and serene   Its almost like the force from Star Wars   Peace  the universe  good vibes  i don't know    it's hard to explain   Meth has been so shitty since ephedrine was banned in the US    The stuff these days we'd call sleeper dope  cause you can actually sleep after doing it    Although I'd like to think those days are behind me    Haven't shot up in years  Ugh I don't know if I could've made it the first 6 8 months without those endorphins  And I hate working out  but love how I feel after  When I start to feel tired or stressed these days I ask myself "are you exercising and eating properly " Chances are if that answer is no  that is the precise remedy to my ails   How long had you quit before the relapse  And how much do you feel it set you back   Congrats on keeping it up  23 days is awesome  Nice  well way to go   There was corn in my salad yesterday   Bro  you got this  Congrats to you  Spurs are certainly in form at the moment  Congratulations  and enjoy Sissoko   heh    I'm bothered with Brighton still pinching our tails  but pretty much certain we'll be back next year  Rafa is a fucking good manager   reassembled a whole squad while making a profit  slashing the wage bill and reigniting the Geordie passion  Yeah in my state at least  My friend got caught with 10gs in a different state and if was just a civil offence  I got caught with 2gs and I have to go to court  I have a friend who spent a few days in jail for an eighth but it was his 2nd or 3rd offense I think   Silly goose  this fucks up my sexuality so badly    Stupid emotions   Watch out  I once used this excuse back in 2013 during a three week stint not drinking and actually WAS pregnant      Good for you for staying sober  Sorry you had to deal with the awkwardness of that  Yeesh  Thank you and happy 2017 to you   Oh you get used to it  I guess  But thanks man  Staying strong   It is a new life  Thank you  It was such a success  I'm so proud of myself  It's a scary thing because I have to remember I'm still broken  but I did it and things went better than I could have hoped  Good way to think about it  I'm a New Year quitter and it does sound daunting  Thanks I personally lurked on this forum and picked up some ideas that I thought would work for me  I put together a rough plan  which I describe in my  "Sunday Solution" post   https   www reddit com r stopdrinking comments 3vn5g7 sunday solutions my plan and path from day 1 to    I found it useful to keep myself occupied  lots of gaming  TV  netflix  and stocked up on sparkling water  just drinking that whenever I got an urge  I set myself goals   30 days  60  90  etc  It took me time to adjust to living and coping sober  and slowly I dug myself out of some of the holes I'd dug myself into      I fail to see how    But okay   I mean that's like my go to porn sub right there  I certainly can't sleep on it but I'm a horrific insomniac as it is  I can't really fuck with stimulants anymore    I swung in the other direction but I haven't shot up in ages either   Get your number badge right  here  https   www reddit com r stopsmoking comments mwwyz now introducing selfserve badges    I am making my decision to NOT drink today  Happy 2017  SD  Once upon a time  maybe    I have a pretty dim view of marriage these days   I'm just happier and healthier without it  This is true for me too  without going into the negative consequences of my drinking  the positive benefits of my not drinking are great reasons in themselves   "wing bar" I love it  Happy new year everyone  You are all amazing  I will not drink with you today  It's true  I stepped on the scale this morning  and in comparison to other food alcohol binges  I was definitely down  Not as much water retention  Woah man u liked your story until what u said at the end Congrats to you on 34 years   You're  my  inspiration  Baffling  isn't it  I hated the consequences of drinking but there was some disconnect where everyday i would start drinking again thinking the results would be different  Insanity  It turns out the only way for me to not have the negative effects of alcohol is for me to not take the first drink  Yeah the effects of nicotine can mildly treat ADHD  Yeh  figured it out x   Thanks a lot and good luck  Fuck it then  Never liked bongs  may as well sniff glue straight from the jar  Very uncivilized    I still am told a lot how I didn't really have a problem  I deal with this a lot too   Because I did not hit "rock bottom" or seek professional help  I must not have had a drinking problem   My conclusion here is only one person should determine whether I have a problem  or the degree of the problem  and that person is me   It seems you've identified a source of negativity in your life and taken steps to remove it   Continue to do what you feel is best for you and your family  What a weird night  Thx SD for the support  I will not drink again today so I can count 100 days tomorrow  For me I had to build a FUN sober life   I did that by making new friends   mostly through AA  connected with a hobby I had always wanted to do but was too drunk and disconnected to try in the past  use physical activity to increase my endorphins and most importantly I had to build up my support network   I went to counseling and meetings   I have to have a fun sober life   but it isn't going to show up at my door   I have to look for it and create it   I wish you luck   I will not drink with you today   Thank you for this  I'm not the OP but I found this comment to be tremendously helpful  I've been struggling with my ED for several years now and also experience many of the same consequences you listed  It's a long and difficult journey to trek through  but your comment helps to remind not only of the painful complications of continuing the ED but also of the beautiful hopes of recovery  I wish you  and everyone else in this thread  the best of luck in beating all of this  I love it when the numbers "add up"       What worked for me is not holding in my anger    It would just build up and then all come out at once when I'm drunk    Let it out in small bits as it happens    Be more of an asshole sober  in order to be less of an uber cunt while drunk  Sign me up please  might as well try  I got bullied about my not drinking by a family member at my first social outing   3 months sober at that point  and I got accused of being pregnant  relentlessly  I got through it  by just saying I'm just not drinking and left it at that  A month later I decided that I would remain sober  and said family member came to accept my choice and accept that I wouldn't be a drinking buddy anymore    My answer varies depending on the circumstance  but most of the time I don't have to justify my not drinking   I just say I'm not drinking and choose a soft drink  When I do offer an explanation  if I don't want to go into it  I'll just say I'm happier and healthier without alcohol  It's real rare that anyone hassles me for a reason  and if they do  I suspect there's something up with their own relationship with alcohol  Today is my first day as well  I'm not only going to stop drinking i think im gonna learn a new language  Congratulations  I'm really happy for you   I'm also in my early 30s and am really looking forward to enjoying my 30s sober     It sounds like you have some hard work ahead of you but have the support and fortitude to make it   I look forward to hearing more from you  I will not drink today  no drinking over Xmas thanx to Sd  Cheers people keep well  How so  "Alcohol as a medicine" is a reference for self medicating  I'm curious why you find that so stupid and idiotic  in your words   Where are these 'twat bags'   I'd like to buy one providing you can keep them in a pocket  Shit  I creeped on your history too    I wouldn't try to quit two things at one time  You have glue  Albert Einstein  'My sense of god is my sense of wonder about the universe '  I always just supplement the word  universe  whenever I hear god or higher power  I'm with you  see you in 4 6 hours   runnersmansud Suggested 30 Day Sobriety Solution to me on Xmas day after I did something stupid  again  and so after many attempts to quit using willpower alone  I took his suggestion and started that very day  It's been pretty great for me  I have NOTHING to do with this book or their proceeds  but it's working  And I might suggest giving it a shot  I did the audio book    Anyway  I won't drink with you today  You got this   That's why you're the narc  Great story to read this morning  thank you for sharing it  Congratulations on everything you accomplished in 2016   and all the best to you in 2017   Thanks  Hey just do the next right thing  If that is crying uncontrollably for an hour that's ok  If the next right thing is getting a glass of water  that's great too  The next right thing doesn't have to be complicated or cosmic  Just love on yourself  and take it easy  This too will pass  Sending my love your way  Family passing is never easy   Thank you so much  That's incredible  Good luck to you on both fronts  Others have suggested The Naked Mind as well  I haven't downloaded that just yet  but 30 Day Sobriety Solution seems to be doing the trick for now  It's hard to explain what makes it different  but it is different  Somehow  Anyway  enough  I'm rambling  Glad you're here   Hey hey   now     We don't use that word    I prefer " emotional infatuatior " Thank you  Fuck that  I have standards  Absolutely  Thank you  I'm only 5 days sober  but I made it through last night without a drink  Congrats everyone        No more socialising with people who can't respect my boundaries  Like your SO    You gotta explain to him why you don't drink  Why you can't  And explain again  Some people don't understand addiction but it'll be important that he does for him to be supportive  Fair enough      I'm aiming to be a victor of 2017  D Wow  What an inspiring post  I will not drink with you today   I kinda figured you had a little when your roomie was holding    You did have some awfully long posts for a couple days    Not judging  I would have done it    I have horrible insomnia too    Probably why I like alcohol so much    Blacking out is just about the only way I can keep normal hours    I'm feeling depressed and angry a lot of the time  and alcohol is just making me volatile  You are now on the path to being clear headed and mindful   Alcohol only exacerbated my anger and depression issues as well   Buckle in  as the first few months can often be a roller coaster of emotions  at least it was for me     It is well worth the ride      every single regret I have centres on alcohol  Sounds like you've identified a source of negativity in your life   Your decision to be honest with your wife will likely strengthen your relationship and open up the communication channels  which is usually a good thing   I was never honest and open with my wife about alcohol problems and now I'm divorced   Probably not coincidental  As Annie Grace's father said  "It's not doing me any favors " Nope  don't need it today  Happy 2017   I have the world's slowest metabolism  thanks  gastroparesis  so no big deal if you miss a flight     Wow  I am super impressed that you talked to your friend like that  That's really brave  and probably exactly what needed to be done to stop the badgering  Some people just don't understand the seriousness of our decision  Well  with a name like Chimichangas  Keto might be a struggle for you   May I recommend  these   http   www poormansatkins com blog low carb chimichanga recipe      Wow the transformation is incredible  I hope to be you one year from now  Day 9 v2  welcome new sober people  You will soon discover how great it feels to wake up in your own bed without a hangover  it's awesome  I will not drink with you today  That is magic  can I have your friends  Zip lock freezer bags    Keeps a prostitutes junk VERY FRESH until you're ready to blow another load    Pro tip   Wrap her head in aluminum foil  The lips get all puffy once the head is removed and you put it into a zip lock    Just trust me    You dont need to heat powder   That's not how it works when you're blacked out  I am not in control  I can't just do that  No worries at all   I appreciate any comments   I definitely have not forgotten why I wanted to quit in the first place   I went into it without a real plan other than to take it one minute  hour and day at a time  and for me going 11 days was a real win   I wasn't prepared for last night because I did not expect this girl to have any weed haha   I wrestled with whether to consider today a new day one or not before I posted this and realized that it really didn't even matter    Going from smoking from the time I woke up till the time I went to bed  to sharing a spontaneous j with a friend is progress for me     I can't predict the future any better than anyone else here  but what I can do is control the way I react to things like setbacks and perceived failures    I'm three weeks in a feel pretty good  Wallet isn't drained  brain much clearer  and motivation high  But I've slipped plenty myself  One has to dust themselves off and get back in the game  Check Good message man  You know what's up  and best of luck with the college semester approaching   Hope I can make it  It's my first football weekend without a drink  I'm a nervous wreck  Hopefully my team does well and I don't think about the drink  Please keep me in your thoughts  Thank You That's what you did  How bad were you when you were bad  How do you let out your anger  I'm not an angry person at all  I don't know how to let out my anger  I feel like I don't have any  but I feel like that's because I let it all out when I'm drunk  Day 3  Feeling a lot better finally  I will not drink with you today    This is all incredibly helpful  Thank you so much for sharing your experience and advice  I'm with you in that the luck I believe in is the fortunateness to have found a supportive group that shares a similar belief system and encouragement that I have   Thank you for your help  That's so awesome  What great news on New Year's Day  Congratulations  Sober on   If     You aren't THAT new   Thank you for the encouraging words  I'm going the same road and sometimes it feels like I leave people behind  but then there's people like you who do the same and   kinda validate my reality  So  thank you  Your resolve's an inspiration in my life    And to the OP  stay strong  use effective boundaries and become better day by day   This Naked Mind was a true "game changer" for me   Also read Stop Drinking Now which was also very good  Said every alcoholic ever  yet we really don't  Do we  My mouth is  watering    Two weeks  I haven't been this hungover in years  I woke up and immediately wanted relief and thoughr about kratom  I won't do it  but I thought seriously about it the first time   I am going to hibernate today  This subreddit is for those concerned about others drinking  which it sounds like you may fit  However it sounds like you want to stop drinking yourself so head over to the stopdrinking subreddit  Sorry I don't know how to link   It's why I now refer to Brenda as my former "Emotional Support Pig"   In  Nah man  I get it  I've just never been one for stuff like big weddings and such  It's only a fluke that I got married to begin with as I never had a desire for a family  kids  and all that    If she's the one though  you can always get married on the cheap side  Then have a bigger ceremony later on  You can have a pretty badass wedding for relatively little money  and if you got two people putting money towards it  it's easier  Of the few weddings I went to  the best was the smallest one  Handful of people in a park with a rented pavilion    Fuck  now I've got the feels  The couple that got married were a shitshow  and the marriage didn't last  but the chick I went with was seriously the most awesome girl  I basically cast her aside  because i knew she'd need a better man than I could be at the time   Perfect timing   Just finished watching Red Dragon   Fuck it   off to buy some spirits now  Beer simply isn't cutting it  Don't let that ego disease thought keep you out   There are always people who are willing to sponsor or willing to guide you towards one   The disease of addiction is based on total self centeredness  which comes in  those  thoughts   "no one wants to be my sponsor"  It wants us to fee separate  different and alone    Which is why the value of meetings comes from identification  hope  and sharing   Just go ask someone who seems like they have good recovery and are involved in the program  Don't listen  watch  You'll see it more than you'll hear it   Keep at it  the love in the rooms is there for you  What did you learn  There has to be some value in that  If your hubby does not drink  you may want to remove the alcohol from your home  It would probably help during times of impulsive temptations  User name checks out   All I'm trying to say here is  it's ok to have set backs   It's ok to slip up   And it's ok to be ok with all of that   So many times I've gone a couple of days  smoked  then figured to hell with it all  I already failed  I might as well give up   My point here is to rid myself of that line of thinking    You're still learning Niki  you can cut yourself some slack here   In trying and relapsing throughout last year  I found that there were moments of panic craving that would come out of nowhere   Sometimes I'd head to the store for a bottle  I noticed that by the time I got in my car and drove the 5 10 min to the store  the feeling had mostly past   So that's how I learned that those feelings will pass   in usually no more than 20 minutes for me   I came to see having them as the dues I needed to pay to get the proverbial monkey off my back   it was almost satisfying to  pay the price    I know I could not have alcohol in my house   it would just make it  too easy  to pick up again  If I were you then I would get rid of the other 20 suboxone   When I say get rid  I mean  destroy them   If you don't need them anymore then you don't need them   For me personally  when I held onto things like that it was because I was telling myself that I couldn't dispose of them just in case I "needed them "  As in  just in case I relapsed because I still had it in my mind that was a potential option   Anyway  you are doing a good job   I am proud of you for making it this far   Keep going   You will only feel better and better  Yeah  this is really what happened to me    Our couples counselor the other day asked me what got me to drink again  I went down this path of "oh  we were really worried about this or that and work was really stressful   " and then I cut myself off and was like  "Wait  No  That's a lie  It wasn't that at all  It's just that I thought I could handle it again  I was sure I had it beat " And  you know  with the extrinsic motivation of being pregnant  I was fine  it's once the baby was born that there were more work arounds that I was able to get a steady buzz every night  My second time around rock bottom wasn't want most people would consider bad  it's just that  in comparison to how great sobriety was  I knew I was selling myself short  Booze and mamas is a topic I could go on and on about     This is lovely  Thank you for sharing  Me too  Actually I just really wasn't sleeping  lol  It was insanely frustrating me because I could not manage to drink myself into oblivion and she was annoying the fuck out of me  much like the bitch who took her place is doing right fucking now     Like holy fuck  people NEVER SHUT UP and I'm not exactly subtle that I am not in the mood to talk about their stupid bullshit on my fucking day off  That's why I'm in bed attempting to avoid people  ffs    That's not to say I'm completely innocent    But last week  nah   Thank you   This really helped me  was very tempted to smoke during NYE party but then I just remembered your post  about the fact that it's never just one  so I resisted     Happy New Year   Tuna   You've been missed man  Fucking outstanding to play wth you here again    Happy New Year brother   I am not the person you just replied to but please do post   It is always easy for me to find reasons not to when I know that I really should   if not to help myself  to possibly help someone else  And the real junkie in the house rolls up   3  Checking in  trying to string together a good streak  that's good to hear  I know I am repeating myself here  but if you're serious about getting better and need medical help  don't worry about the money  There are people out there whose job it is to help you get the help you need and how to get it paid for  and getting that help now is a lot better than dealing with a catastrophic health problem  AA is a good place to start  and a good tool for staying sober  but sometimes you need some good old fashioned western medicine  Love this story  I can't think of a more perfect NYE  sober   present   and quite possibly saving lives   Well done  Happy 2017  Yes   let's make it the best  I will not drink with you today   My best friend drunkenly said "but you're so much fun when you drink " and my  now ex  boyfriend implied that he liked me more when I was drinking    so I made it a point to prove my best friend wrong and I dumped the scrub of a boyfruend  So now I'm way more fun than ever before without the anger of alcohol and the dead weight of a scrub             Yea that mental side is hard and it's most likely gonna be like that for about 4 5 days  but just hang in there  you are doing great by bicycling 20 miles You have taken the most important step which is to put that shit down and decide to be sober  The good thing is that your daily dose wasn't very high like many other people I've met that take up to 30 grams a day  it shouldn't be too long for you to feel level headed  Keep exercising  I found these non habit forming herbs and teas to be helpful  valerian root  helps with anxiety and sleep   yerba mate tea  great for depression   and coffee helped me get through the blues  If you can't find yerba mate  tea  green tea is another fantastic option  it has loads of L theanine and caffeine that help with the mental side  I drank loads of yerba mate  and green tea to get through the withdrawals  maybe around 4   5 cups a day and valerian root and melatonin at night to help with sleep   I know how you feel about feeling like you had been fooling everyone because you were using kratom  You know  the way I see it  kratom is a very powerful and useful tool for coming off other drugs and for me it was a godsend in the beginning because benzos left me with an insane amount of anxiety when I stopped using   I felt as if I was broken somehow   Was I a fraud for using kratom  I don't think so  I needed to readapt to my surroundings after fighting Benzo addiction and I feel like taking kratom was a good step in the right direction  It is hard  to readapt to life post benzos  My addiction lasted well over 10 years of Xanax and Valium abuse  and to me it was a necessity to fight Benzo cravings which are fuckin mental   Now that I'm clear headed  I feel like a stronger human being  and I just begin everyday setting the intentions of staying sober and healthy  I avoid people that use  that was the hardest part and that's where recovery groups help sooooooo much     Just stay strong  you are already a strong being for leaving those insidious benzos in your past and in my experience  kratom's withdrawals aren't as bad as those of benzos  but everyone is different   Push yourself to be social while withdrawing because it helps you not think of "the what ifs" and you will see how occupying your mind eases those thoughts out of your head  Also  I can't emphasize how much meditation helps in this process  it will make you feel in control of your mind and body once again   Best wishes mate   Where in England are you  I love England  I'm obsessed with all things British  I'm in Austin  Texas and this place sucks  Checking in  Good luck  everyone   Same  I was really tempted to smoke last night as just "one last cig" before the new year  but I had already made it so far and didn't want to throw away the work i had already put in  Just got a jump start and feel great  Happy new year   There is no mention of that being in the original post   someone gets drunk a couple of times and thinks" wow  this is my medication and what does everything think about that"  I took that as an idiotic question from a stupid individual  satisfied  I meant when  Obviously    Just like you know if I tried to come there my ass would end up on a STL bus station floor again   Hot showers feel great while still going through the motions of detoxing   I showered as many times a day as I could while I detoxed   I preferred to bathe but there were no bath tubs at the rehab that I was a patient at nor would I have wanted to get a bath in a tub that is probably oozing with the end result of 30 men just getting clean and their hormones back if you catch my drift   Keep going man   You're doing great  I saw a quitting post a while back from someone and there was a comment about getting a group going to try and keep tabs on our progress  I never saw any good options of how to stay in touch  Last night was my last round as well and going to need the same moral support some of you will  Any ideas  Good luck everyone  happy 2017  You did well  OP  It does sound like you handled it the right way  When the time comes  you can apologize to her again about hurting her feelings  Makes sure that when you do  though  it's for her feelings  not for you telling her what upset yours  You're entitled to your feelings  and you didn't do anything irrational here  I promise  As someone else said  there's a difference between aggressive and assertive  Being assertive is actually a really valuable skill  and it's important for your mental health   Yup I drank a coffee at like 7 pm and stayed up until close to two  Sure beats an alcohol hang over    Sign me up please  Looking to an improved 2017 Schooling people everywhere  Well this is enlightening   Excellent news       Hold my beer  What could possible go wrong  Not today Sounds like lots of good insight to your past and a great plan for your future  I've been noticing that quite a few of you with big numbers next to your stars on SD are members of AA  It works if you work it   and it sounds like you're working it      yeah  I was handed some sort of Mexican "energy drink"    it's like a green tea soda drink    effing delicious but I was up until 4am feeling great hahahah so now I'm like too much sleep in the wrong part of the day hungover      ugh   I'll take it  25 year old buddies   I made it through last night  Onward to a sober 2017  I will not drink today  Sneezing and not sleeping were always the worst two things I experienced when detoxing   Eventually  after using long enough  constant vomiting dry heaving was thrown into that mix to create a trifecta of "I hate my life" symptoms   In the first 1 1 5 weeks of my recovery I didn't sleep more than 1 5 hours which happened one night while sitting up in a chair   Beyond that  I didn't sleep for so long that my eyes went cross eyed and my vision blurred to the extent that I couldn't tell who a person was without them telling me even though they were 3 feet in front of me   I didn't die though and neither will you   It is miserable but the reward is tremendous   Good luck man   Happy near year  good luck As someone who just bought their last dub  I feel you  I honestly have been trying to quit because I spend all the money from my  8 05 job on weed  and I realized being high all the time is too expensive for the amount of work I put in to get my money  And music is honestly my absolute favorite thing to listen to while high since everything feels so incredible  That gets a big WTF     About a two weeks into my sobriety  my wife  a 99 8  non drinker  says to me  "I'd like for you to be able to moderate someday"  She gets it now  and kept me on the wagon xmas day when I almost cracked open a bottle of pricey red wine that had been gifted to me by someone who didn't know I had 350  sober days   Stay strong  I've not yet wished I'd drank the day before  Stay strong and remember why we are not drinking  You can do it    I was uncomfortable being around people drinking at one point  but it got a LOT easier for me  I hope today can be full of love and hope for you  First check in of 2017  I will not drink today   Congratulations  Hooray  In 3 hours you can do a lot of other things  If it was 30 minutes okay  I got up the courage to ask a guy after about a month   Mainly because I saw the winners  the guys with the sparkle in their eye  all had sponsors   Sounds about right     Oh shit  I don't know how to condense my entire angry drunk life into a single post but I was arrested twice for beating up cops if that's any measure  it was bullshit but still     Sending xboxes for a swim a couple times  threw out all the SO's clothes twice now    Not many people will willingly deal with me anymore        The thing is  when someone pisses you off  do something about it and be done with it there    You're not angry cause your socialized to take shit and deal with it    But us drunks have it all come out at once    The gf pisses you off  tell her off    The wife burns dinner  make your anger known    Someone cuts in front of you  beat them mercilessly     Address even minor annoyances  Lets's talk  man  The best part about you messing up new years eve  was that it was last year    Chin up  fam  We're not even 24hours into the new one   You got this      P s  i quit drinking 2 years ago after binging a 26 of gin  at least  a day  If i can quit drinking  I can quit smoking recreationally   And if i can quit  i have faith that you all can  too   Keep it up  AA has helped me get this far  Similar problem for me  I'm going to vegas in June for a long planned 40th birthday for my wife  For a week  She doesn't drink so it may be doable Three hours in to the new year and you already have some non drinking victories    happy 2017 and happy sober Sunday  What activity are you planning to replace with using alcohol marijuana  Coming from one disgusting human being to another I'm lucky enough not to have any heavy drinking friends   Glad you're  we're  not puking today  For the next couple of weeks   r cripplingalcoholism is participating in our yearly population survey   Please take a few moments to answer

Christmas and am closing in on 9 months clean  Beyond grateful   One love x Hey you had the balls to admit it  You can move from this slip up easy  Well I think that's a really rude thing to write but it's your opinion and I can see where your coming from in a cynical way  I hope you have a great 2017 dude  take er easy   Nice work u stoday  I like the quote  got me thinking  Happy NY and best wishes for a great 2017  Please  Take them  Thank you and best wishes to you too  I think you can find several threads about this   I quit twice  once cold turkey  once using an ecig   Cold turkey was pretty brutal  but after a week or so I was ok   Using the ecig was much easier  but it drew things out and I still had cravings the whole time I was using it  Same here     You got this  Errr  thanks but I haven't been on Reddit for a while  I just got my badge reset  this is day 1  Haha   Congrats on your 481 days though  Was Christmas alright for you this year  2nd sober Christmas I assume   The plan  I'm telling everyone I'm just doing dry January  not that I think I've got a problem  My brother's doing it as well  I'm thinking about going to some AA meetings but not sure  I've been a few times before and I'm not sure it's for me  Other than that I'm going to get back into running  I used to run marathons but my fitness has gotten really bad since I've been drinking pretty much every night for the past couple of years   Other than that I don't know   any tips  Sometimes it's good to have an obsession  keeps us alive and moving  I like to have lots of obsessions    Booze will forever be my first love though       Fireworks    I'm not going to drink today  Almost 4 years   Congrats  I actually sat here NYE and stared at your post for a loooong time      what I showed you was actually only the tip of the iceberg    not to discount everyone else's great advice and comments   I thought about another addict I brought back into my life  who has never abused me in this manner  and is now a successful and happy person and a good friend      and it was really hard  but  you're right  A friend WOULD NEVER say something like this  and even more importantly  I WOULD NEVER SAY SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO ANYONE   I told them that I was genuinely happy for them  he has a   um    sugar daddy   who buys him things  I told them I was really happy that he was better and wished him joy  happiness and success in the coming year   I also told him that this would be where our paths diverge unfortunately  I felt really sad   Anyway  thank you and everyone for the advice  Happy New Years  You need to heat up the water so the powder dissolves in it  Nice   I still remember somebody posting on here that people don't care what's in your cup  they care about what's in theirs   I found this to be mostly true   Only time I see people pushing me to drink these days is when they themselves need to justify their own behaviour  I wanted to give the "what makes it hard to do the same thing 11 days from now" question some thought before I answered   My immediate reaction was to think "well that won't happen"  but I can't say that with any more certainty than someone saying "this is Day 1 and I'm never ever smoking again  although I'm sure it happens  I doubt the majority have it happen that way      So I put myself in the hypothetical scenario  11 days from now I'm with a friend and they offer to smoke   Say I cave and wind up smoking   So now I've smoked twice in 22 days   Should I get upset about it   Or should I just keep on keeping on and think ok  smoking twice in 22 days is far better than my smoking 5 times a day habit  and now I know the situations and people to avoid for a while longer   Getting upset about it would likely lead to me smoking more  while the latter line of thinking gives myself permission to be kind to myself and move on     I find it helpful  when sober  to write down the reasons I don't want to go back to drinking  especially immediately after slipping when the bad feelings are fresh  Good for you for being back  We will not drink together today  I mean     I don't know shit about junkie ing but even with my limited knowledge I know people ain't melting down powder ffs    Seems like a waste of some drugs along some lines  Oh hi  I remember your username from when I first posted and you were magnificent  Thank you and the same to you     I've had a major problem the last couple years  My last drink was at 11 57pm last night  Just poured out anything leftover  I will not drink today or this year  Yeah  you want 16 24 hours     it's not about the amount of time  it's about how sick she is  I mean  you want her to be in FULL withdrawals  It sucks  but it's the only way to make sure you don't make her REALLY sick  and trust me  precipitated withdrawals are awful  I know I'm a few days late to this  and not to offend anyone  but the only thing I can suggest is that she'll need probably 4mg tops  Bupe  sub  works way better when used in smaller doses because of how your opiate receptors receive it  the whole partial agonist thing  so there's most likely no reason she should need 16mg  That's a crazy high dose and you want to get her off as quickly as possible  When you give it to her  give her 2mg every 45 minutes until she's well  That's how a detox would do it  Good luck  It's so nice of you to be there for her when you know that she's obviously using and that's kinda dangerous  Take care of yourself and her  Let us know if you need anything  and keep us posted   Day 1 and waiting on badge reset  I will not drink today   I am starting today also  Best of luck  Let's make 2017 a year to remember  quite literally      So  I'm not talking from successful personal experience here  so take it as it is   I also worry about what you describe  and I think a lot of people have  The one thing that I hope is that I am able to change my thinking about cigarettes so that they hold no value for me   A year in  or six months in or even two weeks in  there is no addiction in any physical sense   The only reason we even consider going back is in our head  so it must be that we romanticize smoking  in some misguided self brainwashing   Its important to continually work against any idea that smoking is at all good pleasurable etc   I compare what I should be thinking about cigarettes to what I do think about heroin  maybe it feels good sometimes  but it is a sure ticket to poor health and death and there is NO way I would shoot up even a little  Not ever   I mean like I can guarantee I would not shoot up heroin in my lifetime   So  ya  think the same about cigs   Sign me up  Ready to do this   Uggghhhh me too  I drank diet coke  and iced tea all day  I never indulge in that much caffeine  then stayed up all night with my nose in a book I can't put down  Hubby and I promised each other to take a walk in the woods before sun up  so we could see  the first light of the new year together  5 am was too early but we'll worth it  Now I'm sluggish and tired  but happy and proud and ready for some new beginnings   Happy New Year  Man    don't lie to the doctors  This makes me laugh  but not for the reason you might think  I went to those fuckers as honest as possible  Like  doc I'm drinking myself to death type shit  Do you know how much they tried to convince me that I'm exaggerating my drinking and that a 25 year old female couldn't possibly believe she's killing herself with the sweet nectar  So much so that they refused to write down the reason for my liver issues  I said that I'm an alcoholic  but they were kind and wrote "anxious but pleasant" on the dismissal papers or whatever the fuck they are called  Made it through New Years Ever  and I feel rad   Here comes another 24 hours     Yeah  I believe it   It was an incredible bitch for me after only 3 yrs   I think once the habit has been ingrained though    hard is hard   And no matter how many years a person has been using  it is completely worth it to drop the habit     Last night was nerve wracking for me  it was hard for my wife too because I think she was nervous for me  we wound up having a really nice time with friends and at the end of the night instead of being drunk I was able to gather our kids  drive home  put our kids to bed    help our son when we has having some stomach issues  All things I never would have been available for in the past and would be catching tons of grief for this morning because my poor wife would've been left alone to tend to  Also  woke up this morning and let me wife and kids sleep in  when she got up there was a pot of coffee made and I was able to make the kids breakfast  we were able to have a nice conversation rather than deal with me zoned out on the sofa waiting for a hangover to pass    life is much better this way  I feel like I've evolved from needing alcohol  Sign me up  Let's go   Awwwww   now we having a heart to heart  I mean  ya  I've had a bunch of fucked up relationships   But man  this feels like the one  We been together 6 months  I stay drunk  most all the time  But she's OK with that    I know I'm a drunk idiot  but I think about marrying this girl every morning I wake up  She has had some bad experiences with being married  But I haven't   Every single morning I wake up next to her  I feel like the luckiest guy in the world   I think I want a big out door ceremony   I want my step dad to read the vows that I write  and then everybody gets drunk after    Let's just all have a good time and then I'm married   Wow  I'm in awe and in tears  Thank you for telling your story with so much humility and grace  Your 'What Happened' and 'What It's Like Now' give me  so much hope   God bless you  Congratulations  Hitting numeric targets is awesome  Keep up the good work  Dope is water soluble and does not need heat  The cut is what ends up dissolving when you heat it  You dont even  need  to heat tar except that it breaks it down faster    Oh  wait  Are you not in the states  I'm not sure about  3 which is the H they get in Europe  I will not drink today  I don't use AA anymore  I did though  You know  doctor  You know   Well I already detoxed from dope  Alcohol is my Problem now Loving this quote  What novel  Thank you  I stared at this and another posters message NYE    My friends don't say shit like that  neither should yours      and although he constantly accuses me of being 'negative' and hurtful  I had actually started to question myself  and re read almost everything I ever sent him over my phone and facebook    Long story short  it came down to this  I PERSONALLY WOULD NEVER SAY SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO ANYONE   much less a friend  and you only saw a very small portion of the pages of abuse    And after wishing him joy and happiness  made it known that this would be where our paths diverge       thanks everyone for all your advice      and good luck to you in your own battles and lives  As I said in my other post  I have a good friend who battled her way back from the brink  and she has never been abusive in this manner to me  and she is happy and successful and she fought every step of the way back up  So I guess I'm saying this because I don't want to leave you guys and   girls     um   ladies     with a negative image   This is just someone who was a shitty person before and he's a shitty person after  Addicted Sober made no difference  AA has been and continues to be instrumental to my sobriety   Glad you are giving it a try     I will not drink with you today  I still do   I have made a lot of friends in AA and they are part of my support network   I get something out of each meeting I go to    It feels great to greet the New Year with a clear head and no hangover  Happy New Year fellow sobernauts  I will not drink with all of you today  That left one looks great   Thanks  I'm three weeks in and feel pretty good  Nice not to be hung over  empty wallet  anxious  etc  I know it is up to me  but there is so much I want to achieve this year  and wasting time in a binge withdrawal cycle will not make it possible  Best wishes for 2017 to you  Okay  I am going to check it out  www pira    er  netflix  netflix  Man I hated living in STL    Have you been excercising  Cycling has helped me tremendously  maybe go out for a long walk or a bike ride  I was a 10  year daily smoker and I'm only on day 6  but daily excercise and plenty of water has really helped to get my appetite back  Insomnia has been more of a problem for me  but if I bust my ass for an hour or two on the bike I sleep like a baby  Easy for me to say though  I have been into cycling for a few years  but I probably couldn't have quit weed without cycling  Its okay to feel completely defeated for a few hours  but don't let some random idiot kid run your life  I'm sorry this happened to you  but I think its important to remember that this is a kid  They are impulsive and probably don't know any better  I  and I'm sure a lot of people on this sub  have gotten picked on  and it sucks  but a lot of the time its done by people who truly do not matter in your life  are not part of your life and we could probably care less if they vanished and we never saw them again  I know its hard to accept but the people in your life  and my life  all of our lives  who are worth spending time with and who care about us truly do not give a single fuck what your face looks like  Incidents like these make you more resilient and are motivating to help stop picking  But really  I maintain that the worst thing someone with CSP can do is be down on themselves for something that is so hard to control  It makes you feel completely out of control  we're not  and makes you feel like shit and when you feel bad  you pick more  I know it was probably so humiliating and I'm not trying to say "just get over it"  but I know you are capable of using this experience to make yourself stronger instead of letting it bring you down  Its the only way shit is going to get better  I didn't live there  I got kicked off the bus from KC     Happy New Year SD  Celebrating my first voluntarily sober NY  It was a great night  I will not drink with you all today  Here's to a sober 2017  If you are even relatively productive for the remaining 13 hours of being awake then I see no issue with that   Me too  Let's do this  2017 is going to be a great year       Oh eff  that's awful  I'm so sorry that happened to you  I'm 39 days in off a 3 5yr addiction today as well  Still battling some depression for sure  I've pondered whether or not I should get back on antidepressants but have decided not to  I've taken them in the past and can't say that they did much for me  I wanna figure out how to live a happy life without any of that shit  I don't trust it or the doctors that prescribe it    Have you tried exercising  I realize its about the last thing in the world that any of us wanna do after quitting but it's better for your mind than any pill any doctor could ever give you  If you can push thru the first week  you will start to look forward to it and even enjoy it  Also    eating a very clean diet does wonders for your mind and energy levels    Good luck on your journey and hang in there  Happy new year   On my last attempt to quit I would watch small bits of this video while outside instead of smoking  I would download it because YouTube takes it down for copyright infringement  I have a copy on my phone   Good luck   It feels awesome  doesn't it   Bravo for seven months    Hi  If you check the sidebar of  r stopdrinking  there is a link for "books"  You will find quite a selection there         It's like you've never done this before       You dont even need to heat tar except that it breaks it down faster    First off  the only opiates I banged were pharmaceutical    So I don't know shit about tar    But when you want to slam your meth  coke  hydromorphone  whatever  I  guess  you can drop that in water and wait for it to dissolve in its own sweet time  not knowing if you're wasting any of your precious drugs that weren't dissolved yet  or you can stick a lighter under that bitch and make sure it's good to go right fucking now  I only got one happy new years text too  Every year i always send at least 6 or 7 out  It actually was a realization that I don't really have many true  supportive people in my life  Another reason to change  Also was an indication that many people aren't awake drunk at midnight   Is NYC alcoholic friendly  It's so weird  Logically I know that weed doesn't even make me feel better at this point  that it's a shitty drug for me and that it actually makes me feel worse than I would if I were sober  but the habit of smoking is so built in and automatic that I just go on ahead and smoke anyway even though I know what will happen  This is classic addictive behavior   I haven't ever seen anyone heat meth either     It is a good feeling to know that  first  I'm now trusted to follow through with what I say I'm going to do   and second  I am sober and  mostly  clear headed at any time  so I can offer safe options to those I love     Congrats on this first milestone    I've never been bad enough to be taken to a hospital  I think it's because my friends know better than to freak if I'm dying  I have my own DNR pact going with my girls  I always say I wanna go happy  Aka  drunk  I'm with you guys  I hope this is a great year of change for all of us    Not drinking today  Exactly the same thing happened to me  Does this mean we failed already  I mean  technically it was New Years Eve night  correct  Love this  Sets a nice tone for the new year   sign me up  Made it through last night  even though I had a fight with my so after being at a new year's party for five hours  If I can make it through that I have no excuse not to make it through today  That's really shitty thing for her to do   It's great  however that you can just let it roll off your back   And  I agree  it absolutely says more about her problems with alcohol than you solving yours   Have a great  sober new year  A little late but please sign me up     It was difficult but I was able to find the strength once again  It's hard to forgive yourself for the all the damage and deal with what seems like a futile recovery  I wish you luck on your recovery as well  thank you for the kind words  I am here to talk for anyone who sees this    You can piss in the street  pass out on 41st street and have a homeless crackhead blow you     I'd say so   Yeah  definitely cynical I'm being serious though sick of these kind of questions  real drag on the forums  anyhow Happy New Year to you and yours   cheers  Yeah  definitely cynical I'm being serious though sick of these kind of questions  real drag on the forums  anyhow Happy New Year to you and yours   cheers  Got home after partying for New Year's Eve and PMO'd while drunk and high  Since that was last night  does that still count as a relapse  It was past midnight  so technically it was the first of January  Just trying to be honest here  I know  haha  I was at a friends house making music until like 2 am  and when I got out to drive home there was a huge snowstorm  I was able to drive home safely  something that would have been impossible if I was drinking  I also thought about how getting pulled over would have been funny  I was always paranoid about that before and now I don't care anymore   I've made it through Christmas  and now New Year's and I'm really happy about it  2017 is going to be a great year  Are all opies not pharmaceutical     Heroin is a pharma    My lord  You too  buddy ya  I been dealing with a lot of shit  Miss everyone around here  too  Mad loves  bro  When I think about all the time I wasted  Relapse is part of the recovery process  Dust yourself off and try again  Thank you for being so understanding and providing this support  It seems that no one in "real life" understands so this was so nice to hear  thank you for making me feel less alone  Yup  definitely a relapse  Quit as soon as you can and stay away from all things gaming for at least a month  Don't worry  It's very normal  Keep on keeping on  You're such a good aunt  thank you for doing that for them   It's like you've never done this before    17 years IVing heroin on a pretty much daily basis except for recently  I think I've done this before    I have much more experience with H and less with pills  But i also know that you still dont really need to heat pills unless they are the gel ones that need to be dropped in hot water  Pills  especially  should not be heated because of all the binders  It's basic harm reduction   This is what I came here to hear  I know logically that the best thing would be to quit forever but I know that I just can't handle that  Staying the fuck away from opiates and getting my life back  Only on day 5 right now  vacation is over on Tuesday and I'm fighting a monster head chest cold    I'm so thankful for my wonderful wife and family  Despite not feeling many positive emotions at the moment  I know that underlying gratitude is the purest thing I have to offer  It's tough to just say it without having the true emotion behind it  One day at a time    Edit  My plans for this year    I have a job promotion on the horizon  Wife and I have 7 months left on our lease before buying a home and plan on trying to conceive our first child in the fall  Damn  I'm so fortunate that I didn't fuck that stuff up during the last year of addiction  Great post  Best wishes for 2017  I'm looking forward to all I can do if I keep myself on the right track  Thank you  And Happy New Year to you too    I am super proud of how easy it was to say NO  I was at a party with my friends smoking around me  Never once was I tempted  I didn't drink excessively either  I know I am going to beat this now more than ever  My mind is finally getting right  Thank you everyone  for believing in me and being on my side  It was such a wonderful thing to find leaves  You guys are without a doubt the reason I made it this far  Whenever I felt like failing  reading your posts hardened my resolve to succeed  Happy New Year  Please post this to  r stopdrinking   r alcoholism  or  r alcoholicsanonymous    As a recovering alcoholic  I can say you have good reason to be questioning your relationship with alcohol  When there is a family history of alcohol abuse  it puts us at risk for alcoholism  That applies to you  One of the symptoms of alcoholism is an inability to control how much we drink once we start    I needed lots of help to stay sober  I got a therapist and went to AA  I had no alcohol in my home  didn't go to bars  and stayed away from anyone who abused alcohol  That's how I protected myself    If you continue drinking  your life is going to deteriorate  Alcoholism gets worse  never better  It is  however  not a moral issue so try not to be ashamed  We are good people with a bad disease    I hope you find the help you need and deserve   Well thanks for the honesty and you too brother   Support from my family has been hit or miss  which is a strange dynamic to live in  They're either praising me or teasing me   and they feel the need to tell EVERYONE that I'm sober    Happy sober new year to you  too  Yikes  What a terrible thing to say  You're definitely not a loser     congrats on almost 100 days    This is so  so awesome and puts into words what I think a lot of us  hopefully  feel  What an accomplishment    I'm only 30 some odd days into it  but I have a starting day and day 30 pic that I'm pretty proud of  I'm a little too protective of my anonymity to post it  but I'm proud of it nevertheless  Your post is especially great because one of the exercises that's helped me is visualization and I've visualized posting updated pictures at 3  6  9  and 12 months  how I'll look and feel when I post them  etc  To see your absolutely terrific metamorphosis into a truly ebullient being  no other word to use  gives me a great frame of reference for how I want my own 365 picture to look  Thank you and congratulations     So  so true  Thank you for these words of wisdom   Congratulations  Starting into 2015 and into January 2016  I lost 30 pounds  I kept up with my fitness routine through all of 2016 and got stronger and gained muscle  Toward the end of the year  though  I started putting on a lot more body fat  There's no question that alcohol was preventing results  and in fact  making me fatter  Today is day 12 of not drinking  and for most of December  I've stopped caring about what I eat drink  I'm feeling the extra weight and anxious to get it off this year  But  I'm putting not drinking as the first priority and dealing with the extra weight for now  Hopefully my 2017 looks like your 2016  I'd use it  Post updates if you begin progress   It sounds to me like he's making up an issue with you to avoid looking at his own issues   It's so much easier to blame someone else than to accept responsibility for his own problems   The thing is  being around recovering people sooner  or later    usually sooner    we see through this and call people on their crap   He'll get called out for being a victim   He won't like it   He'll likely accuse the person or people who pointed this out to him of being unfair  and try to cast himself as the innocent   It won't work   What's more important is that he'll be made aware of it   There are two paths out of this  change and grow  or stay the same and go back to the destructive life we lead before   He may do either   Hopefully he'll change and grow    Someone  will work with him if that's his choice   If he stays the same   any  person needs to cut people like this out of their lives   No one benefits from having someone like this close to them   A person who chooses to deny their own role  at least from my experience  is someone to be pitied  and prayed for   By the way  I was one of these victim people  blaming everyone and everything else for my own screwed up life   I went through being called out   I changed and outgrew it   There  is  hope   Have a great 2017  with one less piece of ballast clinging to you   Peace and love     Hahaha  Thank you  That's awesome  Being direct and honest definitely would have been a better approach  Learning as I go here  It does  Yeah things get worse before they get better in my experience  Just give it time and get an Albuterol inhaler prescription from your doc   This is the way it's supposed to be right   Good stuff right here Well done  YOU  Congratulations on making it through a really hard time of the year  I did as well  and I am proud  I tell you   I'm brand new at sobriety  as you can tell by my badge  and have nearly no wisdom to share whatsoever  But I want to share something that I have to remind myself  constantly  which helps  I keep wanting to say 'I'm never gonna drink again'  and I really want to say this morning 'Here's to a sober 2017 ' However  I'm trying to remember to only say 'Here's to a sober today ' because I can do that  I don't know if I can not drink for a whole year  and I have major doubts that I can not drink for the rest of my life  But I  know  that I can not drink just for today  Just one day is easy  So I'm gonna focus on that  and I will not drink with you today  Yay    Congratulations  Those alcohol calories really do add up  I've "only" lost about 16 pounds since getting sober  but that's two pant sizes down     Happy New Year  I will not drink today  Happy New Year  Happy New Year  sign me up dude  We are starting development next week  I would love to have you as a beta tester   Happy New Year  Happy New Year  sign me up foobar  Happy New Year  Awwww yeah    The clean garage switcheroo  Have a happy and sober New year  Happy New Year  Happy New Year  Checking in  Good luck to all  Happy New Year  I've had something similar happen  grown ass adult woman asked me "what happened to your face " while I was at work  and was miserable for days    People suck  Children are worse  Don't let this stop you from living your life  It's all good man  My wife was the same way  had been married twice  and both were assholes  She knew I drank  as she was my liquor store cashier lol  and was cool with a little drug use  It was rocky for a while  but we've been together almost eight years  and married for five    Seriously though  that sounds like a decent enough situation  and an awesome wedding idea   I actually managed to stay up until 1 am last night  probably more surprising that being sober for it haha Happy New Year  Checking in  Yes  dealing with similar deal here   Wife drinks a lot and I know she does not like my sobriety   I have tried and failed in the past   She likely believes that any day now  I will start drinking   Would be nice to have a bit of support and encouragement from her but that is not the case   Funny  as I would have it for any other self improvement endeavor     She is a lovely person but not ready to quit herself    Best of luck to you    I was where you are three years ago today     Happy New Year  I love it   Although one way of wasting time in advance does come to mind  drinking   Without that  it's totally true  Me too  except the withdrawals  thank God  I went 315 50     Someday I'll  we'll  say "when I finally got sober in 2016   " A truly shitty year  at least I  we  got sober  Alas  unfortunately there was one gauntlet too many  and I gave in  Nothing dramatic happened  but definitely not worth going back down to zero  nor worth feeling hung over today  I've requested a badge reset and I press on  hope you had a good NYE  I'm looking forward to continuing in a more positive direction  even if I took a quick step backward   I quit for over a year  Had a rough few weeks and thought cigs were gonna be the fix  The first one did nothing for me and was a huge disappointment  So I smoked a second  Still nothing and then I felt like shit smoking again  A year down the drain    A few days later I finished the pack and suddenly cigs were doing their magic  Because I was addicted again    Took 7 more years to quit again for more than a week  I'm now at 200 something days    Don't start again totally not worth it   Wow  if you're not full of shit you wasted so much    You heat it up in a spoon for a reason  Happy New Year  I will not drink today   Beer taper has simply to be delayed  There's no other way of saying it  No biggie  planning on drinking a bit the next 14 days anyhow  One won't hurt  Is it 100  necessary for me  Probably not  Could I have a drink once in a while or smoke weed once in a while and not get addicted  Absolutely  I can go to a dinner and have one glass of wine with no problem and no urge that I need more  usually I don't even finish that one glass  I've never been very fond of alcohol or weed  so I can use them once in a great while without a problem  Most alcohol I can't even drink because I have celiac disease so the majority of alcohol will make me very sick  for example  I can't drink beer or any malted beverage or hard cider  white wine  and many of the dark liquors  so I can basically only drink vodka and some types of red wine   But I can't use opiates because those are the drugs I was always addicted to  Some people get addicted to every drug substance so they have to be 100  clean  I'm not one of those people  but it is very common  I hear all the time about people who got clean from heroin opiates  alcohol  coke  benzos  and then thought they could have one drink or smoke one joint and end up either getting addicted to the new substance  yes  I've seen plenty of people get addicted to smoking weed every day  or they get intoxicated off the substance and their inhibitions drop and they think they can use their drug of choice just one more time without repercussions  It really depends on if the person gets addicted to everything they try or was only addicted to one substance  Most drug addicts I know and used with would use multiple substances  usually heroin and coke  heroin and benzos  heroin and weed hash  or heroin and alcohol  and I was never like that  Really    I don't know how you'd get half a gram of pure ice to disolve in a spoonful's amount of water in any kind of reasonable time without heating it  Nope  never does    C'mon in  the water is fine   Well yes  Originally  they were all pharms   But there's a difference between a pill from a pharmacy vs street dope in terms of the purity  cut fillers  etc  and you potentially have to break them down a bit differently depending what it is    For example  you can generally trust that what you get from the pharmacy is unadulterated and not cut with fentanyl or random crap  but it's often also not usually in a form that you can just immediately shove in your veins because of the fillers to make it into a pill and the anti abuse mechanisms they put on a lot of them   You found a good place  my friend  Today is my day 17  and if I didn't have this group to vent to  and to get encouragement from  I wouldn't be at the strong place I am today  No one here will sugar coat things  We are all in the same boat as you  But everyone here is on your side  I have nothing but respect for you for beginning this journey to find your freedom  Stay strong  Check in here all the time  If you feel down  read the posts of others  I found that by helping others here  I actually helped myself  Happy New Year  Sign me up please Cograts on your 8157 days  Not too shabby   I've been diagnosed with various things as well and have been on various different medications but I think all of the psychiatric problems are probably related to my addictions  When I was younger I smoked weed all day for years  I've gotten addicted to extreme weight loss in the past and now I'm addicted to alcohol  It's pretty clear that I've got an addictive personality  and hopefully if I deal with that  the other stuff will sort itself out  It didn't to me  It started off really dark and got very wise and happy in the last five sentences  How much strength you must have to have broken that cycle  And isn't it lovely to know your son kids will never know what they missed   Have you tried the nicotine mouth spray  I use that now and never crave cigarettes   except when I drink  I'm still addicted to nicotine but the main thing is that I'm not breathing in smoke  Nicotine isn't actually that bad for you  One of the few good things to come out of 2016 was my decision to get sober  So welcome 2017  I'll take you one day at a time  and I will not take drink today Good luck  the thing that sucks about family is you can't choose them like you can choose friends  happy new year's and sorry that happened to you    This Naked Mind has been the most powerful thing I've come across to help me make sobriety permanent   https   www reddit com r AskReddit comments 5lfl9l what did the most drunk person say or do last    Happy new year fam   Awesome post  I had the strength to say  "Fuck No " I thought I would allow myself a drink of alcohol if I really hit on cravings hard but I don't like the effects of alcohol so use it as a very last resort and know from previous times that   like you  booze is no substitute for weed      it only weakens my resolve to not smoke   Sooo  no weed and no booze  Woke up happy and clean    Congrats on closing in on 100 days    i'm kinda glad i dont drink anymore too  i was second guessing myself by crawling into bed at 10 30  but after reading a few of those stories  i think i am done with stupid shit like that   Not going to drink today   Checking in  Happy to be sober   Listen to some music  It always helped me  Hang in there man  This will pass  What you feel isn't "normal"   Thank you  Are you offering a bath  or a swim  Both would be agreeable    Nothing like a good back scrub  We never had a problem with it  so idk    I shot more opis than meth though   Awesome  I'm glad you had a great time   Happy New Year   At the end of this month  I am set to become the account manager for a 70 year old company   The opportunity wouldn't exist without my recovery   In 2015  I lost the love of my life as a direct consequence of my drug addiction and criminal behavior   I deserved to lose her  and in retrospect I'm grateful that she left me   It provided me with a more tangible bottom   She is now part of my life again  which is wonderful   Again  not without recovery    I was  300lbs  6'1"  at the end of the line on painkillers and dope   As if being a dope addict isn't depressing enough   I was also obese   I'm currently strong  230lbs   Eat a plant based diet  lift weights  and practice yoga regularly     My goal this year is to become more intensive regarding my step work   No excuses   I feel as if it's vital for me if I wish to continue personal improvement   This community is very supportive   I appreciate you guys immensely     "That no addict seeking recovery need ever die   "  One day at a time     I have your same problem  Right now I'm working on cutting it altogether just because I can't risk those times it does get out of control  It's a slippery slope   Outlast it  Your testicles won't fall off from it or anything  Your body just needs to get used to new ways of living  But we are adaptable as a species  so don't worry  You Rock  Unless you eat too much  yeah listen to that dr advice and keep drinking thats worse  but fuck you need salt in most cooking  Of course  I started face picking when I was in 5th grade and finally have it almost entirely under control  I'm 22 now  I still slip up from time to time of course but have learned to quickly get back on my feet  so I can relate so hard to so many of these stories people post on this sub  and it truly helps and motivates me to be able to share any advice that I have  I think that its impossible for anyone who hasn't suffered from CSP to truly understand the humiliation  the self hate  the isolation that people with CSP go through  And so a lot of times people in real life don't really know how to help  Thats why communities like this are so important  I think it really takes one to know one    In my experience it takes many months to begin to achieve clarity  What you're experiencing may be what's commonly referred to as the "pink cloud " There is nothing wrong with feeling artificially awesome but be aware that it may  and usually does  end  It's important to keep working on the self  even when it doesn't seem necessary  Doing otherwise is like scoring the first touchdown in a football game then taking your team off the field  Or so I'd imagine  I've never seen a coach make that mistake     Keep on keepin on  For me the best way I "helped" my husband was insist his drinking problem not be a secret between us  I said if he really wanted to quit and change we needed to tell our family and close friends  That sounds harsh in a way but I felt like this  it would be harder for him to just act like there was no issue if he had told other people  Plus once he broke the seal so to speak it became easier over time to tell other people  Now he proudly has his 2 year chip on his keychain  I feel like by it just being something the two of is discussed dealt with it was too easy for him to decide it wasn't a problem anymore  It also to me showed he was serious about getting sober which I needed otherwise I was seriously considering separation to protect myself and our child  I had a little more than 30 days since the relapse before that  It was my second 30 day stretch in the last 3 months  The relapse brought back an increase in anxiety  depression  and cravings  Mentally it felt almost like starting over  The emotional side of this is so much harder than the physical  The thing I learned from this relapse is that the addiction finds something in your life or yourself and exploits it to draw you back to using  The thing you start obsessing about feels so real that your instinct says the only way to make it feel better is to use  I'm keeping that realization in my head and identifying the negativity as my addiction trying to get fed   Welcome to one derland       I have some weight and fitness goals    2017 is gonna be the year I finally get strong enough to do pull ups   A fellow sober Wisconsinite   I feel like we're as elusive as Bigfoot   Also back to day 1    I will not drink with you  I will not drink with you today  Reddit  Thank you   I will not drink today  I can easily not add salt to my food    Not drinking     well  that's a taller order  Happy 2017   Sober start for the new year and not drinking today  Peace   Awesome  Thanks for the support  You do not heat pills   And Hardly full of shit  She knows what shes doing  Congratulations for your success so far  Stay strong and don't get too complacent  We believe in you  Oh your comment is so sweet  thanks If you want to  I'll help you get sober   and fit  Currently drinking for the next fortnight  but need to be absolutely dry later in the month  Shout if you need a buddy  Thanks I will not drink today   My first hangover free New Year's Day in many  many years   Feels great and I'm keeping it that way   So jealous that y'all have horses to ride  Horses are amazing therapy     Archery  Cooking new and neat things  Being content with nothing to do instead of feeling bored  I totally agree  I always say I don't crave it but at exactly 6pm after work and shower it's there  Therefore I DO crave it but just didn't admit it to myself    Great post  Thank you  Congratulations to you both   I'm a few steps behind you guys  and was equally excited to wake up feeling good this morning  especially since I couldn't fall asleep until 5 am     Looking forward to a sober 2017  I will not drink with you today  It's better on this side   Of course   I will not drink today  Happy New Year  all  Woke up with a clear head this morning and so glad I didn't drink last night  I would be feeling ten times worse right now  Staying strong  Tha's awesome   Congrats      My simple syrup in this post is a good example    Sugar is soluble in water right   Take a teaspoon of sugar and dump it in a teaspoon of water    Got a bunch of sugar still sitting in that water     Heat it  and the problem is solved    That's why you heat stuff    I don't know if that other guy is bullshitting everyone  or really managed to go 17 years doing it wrong  but that's why you heat your shit before you pull it into the syringe and bang it    Otherwise you're wasting drugs  Sugar sweaters  I had never heard that before  but it's the best description of that feeling that I've ever heard  Almost made me run to the sink for a good tooth brushing   Me too  drank so much ginger ale I have a stomach ache  Ginger ale hangover                      real hangover    Happy new year  That is awesome  Way to go  being helpful and providing for your family  Great start to the 2017  I won't drink with you today   It's horrible at first  before I could never get past 3 4 days and 7  days for me was a long streak but I would always fail because of worries about blue balls  This is tempory though  My big problem was that I would get sexual thoughts and fantasies in the coming days which made it extremely difficult to carry on  On a long streak when it's been many weeks  I find it much easier to block these thoughts  they are still a threat if I let my guard down but for me it's now easy enough to block the thoughts and think of other things instead  I never thought I could do this  I thought I was hooked for life but it's possible to break this bad habit  No more guilt checking to see if anyone's about before getting on the pc and checking out the filth  Those days are now gone  Hope this helps and good luck  Sign me up What is your nicotine level in the juice  Happy New Year   I'm not drinking today  It does seem that way sometimes   Well  it takes a lot of willpower to commit to never looking at porn again  so I would make sure to ask myself if that is a reasonable first goal to strive for     Fighting a serious addiction is going to require some big changes on the inside   You need to literally change the way you view the world   Right now there is a psychological need that porn fulfills for you  and your job right now is to find out what that is   Therapy can be helpful for this   Once you find out what that is  you can set out to find a way to fulfill it with healthier alternatives     You're already going in the right direction  just try to make sure you are doing this for the right reasons   I worry a bit that your wife may not be understanding enough of the gravity of the situation  and as a result may not be as forgiving for future slip ups   So remember that you are also doing this for yourself   You aren't just doing this just for your wife or kids  you are doing this because you know that when you've conquered this darkness  that you will be able to shine a little brighter   Good luck   Yes indeed    Thanks ninjilla  hopefully I'll be requesting a 1 year chip next December   I'm sorry to hear you don't have the support of your husband and that he is abusing alcohol  I was in a similar situation  That's why I got all the support I could find  starting with a therapist  Frankly  I couldn't stay sober with a partner who chose alcohol over me so  with a broken heart  I ended the marriage  I went to Alanon meetings  a support group for friends and family of alcoholics  see  r Alanon  as well as AA  It saved my life   It's awesome to never feel that sack of sh1t feeling after a relapse anymore bro  I went from 18 to 12mg the beginning of Nov   Haha been awhile since I saw that  Fuck Thurs nights ruled How do you remember this but not our conversations  heh WooHoo   Day 6 for me too    Congrats to all of us in our first week   I am still taking tentative baby steps   I struggled a bit last night     actually experienced some pretty strong cravings  but I didn't cave   And I didn't cover up the craving by drinking booze   I sat with the craving and even though my thinking had me wavering a bit  I held strong   I did it    Ya  me  My motivation and energy is starting to come back   I smoked heavy for 30  years so I know a week clean is a drop in the bucket and to not let my guard down   I cut back considerably before I quit to minimize the withdrawals and that worked for me   I never lost my appetite but even so  I can only eat soups with very little meat now whereas my normal diet is steak and salads and bacon and eggs    I am sleeping good and waiting for the dreams to start   I had a short one last night but I want more   Are you dreaming like crazy   I love the intensity of withdrawal dreams   They are so real  Yes  I am feeling much better   My head is clearer    I can breathe easier     I am not paranoid    On to Week 2  We got this  Try taking probiotics  I've had a very limited appetite for over a year but I got sick for about a month and the antibiotics I took to get better totally wiped out my gut flora and made me feel like shit for another few weeks  Started taking probiotics and now I have an appetite I haven't had in a looooong time  Obviously you're not coming off of strong antibiotics but from what I've read now combined with my anecdotal experience I believe that most stomach issues are caused by an imbalance in your stomach bacteria  It's possible that you have stomach issues and the weed was just covering that up   Just a thought  hope you get better man  I sincerely wish you well   We are in the same boat   I'm 38  started when I was 18    Old habits die hard   My monkey brain is running in circles    "what was it I was thinking about   oh yeah  have a smoke   Wait  shit  you quit   No smokes   Do something else   I know   have a smoke   Damn it   just forget about it   go smoke or something   fuck   I know " AHHH CONGRATS  I was a biochemistry major  I don't need a lesson on this  But my shit always dissolved fine  There is a solubility limit but as long as you don't put an extreme amount it should dissolve perfectly fine without heat    We reheated crack to cook off the soda etc but that's about it   Im experiencing extreme fatigue after using 10g of bali twice a day for a month and now im confused depressed  no motivation  lack of enjoyment with normal activities  I've had the same feeling  enjoying simple little experiences and sensations that I normally wouldn't notice   Sometimes I actually feel a little high like you said  like I got dosed with a little ecstasy or something   It may fade eventually  but I like to think it's our bodies thanking us for treating it better   Also maybe my mind feeling so relieved that I'm not a slave to alcohol anymore  letting it dictate my schedule  activities  mood  energy level  etc   Let's enjoy it while it lasts       Happy New Year   I will not drink with you today  You got enough blood   Wait stupid question  There's nothing dangerous in those binders    Claiming that's harm reduction is silly    Solubility isn't instantaneous    Like I posted to unicorn  take a teaspoon of sugar and dump it in a teaspoon of water    Notice all that undissolved sugar even though sugar is soluble in water    Now heat it    Problem solved    People clearly do not know what they're doing    I just don't know if people don't know better or are flat out lying about doing it at all  6 Days and going strong  even managed to go to the pub yesterday to watch football and just drank orange juice  that was tough  Was good to see friends didn't mind which was good support       man    I'm going to do it too just because someone down voted me  Thank you  I stayed home alone  but I stayed sober  It was a very depressing New Year  but at least I didn't smoke Nice    A little  yeah  I mean  I wanted to decrease my level earlier  but I guess I kind of let myself fall into a zone of feeling content where I was and a little bit of a fear of withdrawal   Glad to hear it    And to you  I owe you so much  I've been awake for about 3 hours and I've had about 30 unconscious urges to smoke already    It's a messed up battle   I can't believe I did this to myself   Hang in there Congratulations to you   I wish I had been with you last year     I hope you can help some of us out  You are the man   I didn't have to scour my phone for dumb stuff I posted or texted    Oh man I can so relate to that  6 days sober here and I've been on about a 6 8 week bender  I'm still afraid to dig more than a few days back lol    I didn't have to scour my phone for dumb stuff I posted or texted    Oh man I can so relate to that  6 days sober here and I've been on about a 6 8 week bender  I'm still afraid to dig more than a few days back lol   I will not drink today  Sign me up  This is a new beginning  Inspiring stuff  Thank you for sharing  I didn't stop smoking until I went to sleep  it was probably 3AM   Now I am happy to be done smoking   This is the hardest part  though   There is a monster inside me that I'm killing and it's trying to fight back    Agreed  I hit a personal rock bottom but it wasn't visible to others  It's funny how people feel entitled to ask so many questions about why I don't drink and then comment on how they disagree with my decision  It doesn't bug me as much anymore but sometimes it's frustrating to do all this work to be sober and to feel like society sees me as a bit of an alcohol hypochondriac  I am just glad I have my personal internal motivations to keep me going strong so I don't get caught up in other people's view of myself  You're 16  pick up a hobby and lose yourself in it  Some suggestions   reading  gaming  watching movies  running  or just go hang out with some friends from school  Don't know any  Go meet people  You're 16 man now is the time to fuck around  develop skills in whatever you have an interest in and waste your entire day doing stupid shit with your buddies    Im sure you will get some sick Fuck excited   Go for it  I'm so sorry to hear about your father in law   Give his son and him a hug from us all    Checking in  still going on strong  I'm sorry that she said that to you  but I agree with you that it's more about her projecting about her issues rather than being about you   One of my best friends stopped by last night wasted  and for some reason thought I had previously agreed to have a drink at midnight   After harassing me about that for a while  he tried to negotiate for me to start drinking again just 1 or 2 days a week   Then to "quit"  quit not drinking  after one more month   He wouldn't let it go until we managed to distract him and change the subject   It is a challenge we'll likely continue to deal with occasionally  so I agree with your approach on not taking it seriously   Sounds like you had a very enjoyable New Year's celebration   Congrats on your almost 100 days  Happy New Year  I will not drink with you today  Yes  Please sign me up  Thank you for opening this for another couple days  Closest most of these fucks will ever get to a vagina  Happy  happy 2017   Survived NYE and greeting 2017 clean and sober  Feels great  I will not drink with you today  I like it  no luck needed   But I wish you luck in 2017 anyway  it can't hurt right       I will not drink with you today  Very impressive  Congrats you guys  glad you made it all the way through   Right back at you   I'll take messages from anyone who has quit and is facing the demon  Quite true  I'm slowly integrating though  It's a hard journey  I'll keep an eye out  Thanks for the input  I think when a person is early in their recovery from smoking weed  their number of clean days is very important to them   I know it is for me   I am on Day 6 too  I will repeat some good advice that I read another poster had written a few days ago to a person in your situation           Keep your clean time as Day 6   Day 6 is a huge accomplishment and one tiny slip doesn't need to negate the entire 6 days   Hold onto them   And down the line  when You have more clean time under your belt  adjust the amount of clean time to reflect your tiny wee slip and therefor be more honest with yourself   But for now      hold on fiercely to Your 6 Days   Make them grow  Please don't beat yourself up for it   The holidays are hard enough and we have added stress onto them by withdrawing from weed   Be kind to Yourself   You are doing great  You made an error in judgement   You didn't screw up   This is hard and in truth  what you did was give yourself a lesson in staying clean   You are a wiser person now  better equipped to abstain in 2017  I don't think that one bowl will bring back the heavy withdrawals   I hear you   From what I've been told from my many psychiatrists over the years is that prescribed medication is unlikely to relieve the desire for your own self medication  but we're all individual people  so who knows   And I'm just relaying my own personal experiences anyway  so I should probably fuck off   Sheers  This is my first day as a non drinker in 14 years  I'm 28   But I'm doing the damn thing  Not drinking today  For me  the secret is to recognize the craving and deliberately think about something else   It's a loop though  because of the habit and addiction   Thinking about something else amost immediately leads back to "hm  what to do   I know   Have a cigarette "    When you can get your thoughts to loop away from that trap you will be ok  Checking in  good luck everybody  I'm rooting for you  PM me whenever  Loads of strength for you  Sign me up please  thanks  Love this  luck is for the ill prepared  No I hear you  It's approaching what I call my 'trigger hour'  my usual hours of going out to buy alcohol are 7 10pm every night  so I'm feeling that usual restlessness   I may treat myself to some yummy food for not drinking  who knows      Is it possible for you to go for a long walk  or maybe that run  so what do you think about coins i got a shitload of em  You can do this  I'm with you in not drinking today  Sometimes in the beginning days of sobriety it becomes overwhelming to think about the future  and all that time ahead of us that we "have to" be sober  But I really have to do this 24 hours at a time  There was a time in the early days when I could only commit to not drinking  one  hour at a time  and I still resort to that sometimes   Just focus on today and suddenly it's not so daunting     I'm sober along with you today   We got this  the thought of smoking weed always come to me weather new year or any other day  earlier i used to think those who smoke are cool and now i think those who abstain are cooler   Thank you  Ive have been using for over twenty years   The shit you melt when you heat is not the drugs its the polymers and binders you do not want that shit in your veins  You say waste  No you lick  the powder all up no waste  I have read countless papers and articles not to mention videos on it and if you are a reg user who wants the safest course  Do not heat up pills   Now like Fash said some pills  you gotta cook and brown then grind etc but that is completely different   As for our powder here just add water and stir thats it   As for tar the only reason peeps are heating it is because its faster again you dont have to heat   Like I said Im a 20  year user here  I know what Im talking about  Happy for you  Definitely feel you on the depression  you expressed it quite eloquently   Peace and I wish you many more clear days  I'm curious why you stopped going   Unless you'd prefer not to share   I can imagine many of us will be in this boat at some point  And in total truth  the occasional over indulgence is not terrible  if you know that you can curb it after that one night   But I am also very glad you didn't enjoy it  if that makes sense  I'll raise my glass of water to you for a fresh start  I'm curious why you stopped going   Unless you'd prefer not to share    I'm with you   20 years  but still   Here we go   No luck required   We are forces of nature  I don't think being a biochem major makes you an expert in shooting up    If you're putting a tiny amount of drugs in a big doggy digger syringe  I guess you'd be okay  except for everything else that's wrong with that sentence  Gee  if that's what a loser is  count me as a proud loser  Alcohol is a great thing to lose  D Congratulations on 99 days   Keep it up    I went to the token club in St Matthews I think it was called  the last time I was in Louisville   Anywhere else you'd recommend next time I'm in town  Happy new year to you  too  I will not drink with you today  and I'm damn impressed by your fortitude   Haha and are you sure you want it to be yours  Good luck  You are not alone in this   Since you don't have to worry too much about the health problems with the vapor  I'd say just keep decreasing until you get to zero     You might even want to get a zero mg now and try it  you will fall 1000 times and everytime you fall you learn something that's the rule of life  never ending process buddy Day one for me  I am choosing not to drink today  When do the dreams begin   I want them   I have been looking forward to them   They show me that my brain is recovering   I still have some brain fog and some headaches but I need my dreams to show up  Have always appreciated your introspective posts from the frontlines of your personal battle stoday  Pretty spot on  Especially citing the above underestimating what can be accomplished over enough time  Sometimes looking to and planning for the future is hard because of dark unpredictability and personal inertia  So I looked to the past  be it a year or 5 years  tally the missed opportunities and I was given much better clarity on what I should be doing      Congrats on the progress  I post tampons  Not the source  Not drinking today or the next 24hrs  Thanks a lot  I will give it a shot  Yeah  same thing for me   Buddy   You don't have a drinking problem  dude   My brother was an alcoholic  HE had a problem   Me   But dude  we just had three strong ales at 1 in the afternoon  and we're planning more drinking later   Maybe WE shouldn't drink so much   Buddy   Man  you don't know any real alcoholics  etc    Turns out my buddy wanted someone to overindulge with  and I was him  and he was threatened that I was heading in the "wrong" direction   Good guy and all  but truly  good riddance to him and all the "misery loves company" crowd  Wild imaginations  Fuck yeah  First time trying sign me up  Hahaha   that ain't my problem   p Honestly  this really helps  Its good to know that people care and have been there before  Thanks for the words   24 hours at a time    Thanks Bd       gabapentin is something that is mentioned here quite often   Many have found great relief with it especially when paired with clonidine      happy NY my friend   It's a miracle  I feel the same  I think this is a really good idea  I need all the support I can get  and I think we can all help each other keep tabs on progress and have a support system built in  Maybe a group chat  FB group  or something here on Reddit   You are human  brother  We are still there for you   I had my own moment of weakness around 10 days ago  but that mistake made me realize that I was totally making the right decision  I regretted it even as I was inhaling  and I didn't even enjoy the high    That was a turning point for me  I know you are going through some hard stuff right now  We support you  We got your back  Sometimes you stumble  but as long as you are still going forward  you are closer to your goal  Happy New Year  Happy New Life   It happens  It may even happen again  The amount of times I've said 'never agaaaain' and then that same evening slammed a bottle of wine and 4 cans of cider     yeesh   The fact you're willing to try again is something  Congrats on the year and all the positive change    I won't drink with you today in celebration   Everything most certainly is not black and white   It is my experience that almost everything lands in the grey zone   Weed is not all good or all bad   Abstaining from weed has its down side as well as its huge upside   You are correct   It is all about choice   It is all up to You and what You want and what is important to You   Where do You want to draw the line   Be strong coyote     You got this    if You want it  "still a loser  Did you skip the wine  or are you still fat "  Sounds like you and your friend had a great time     One year for me as of today  I've been a lurker  but this sub has helped me immensely  so thank you   Last year I woke up and decided that drinking never made me have a better time  More importantly  drinking never made me a better wife  parent  guest  or host  The last half of 2015 had me finally using MyFitnessPal to watch what I ate  and I'd lost 25 lbs  Cutting out alcohol was the next step  and it helped me lose 50 lbs  in 2016    Since I stopped drinking  I'm in much better shape  mentally and physically  I'm more in touch with my emotions and anxiety  I'm so much happier than I was a year ago   I'll not be drinking with you in 2017   r stopdrinking  and I look forward to it  Cheers  If it were me  I'd go see a doctor first  I don't know what 'stage' you're at  and

were SO close   5 off  Carr helped me to quit three years ago today  No  but I'm pretty good at knowing how to dissolve things and how much I can feasibly dissolve in a certain amount of water   Funny  I had to start Kratom because of severe gabapentin withdrawal  Sign me up  Love this post  Yes  this is 100  in my power  It is 100  me no matter what happens  and it is 100  me that will get me through today without a drink  I will use the tools I've gathered here and elsewhere  mindfulness  meditation  delaying  playing it forward  etc  and I will make this a great day on purpose  I will not drink with you today     You too friend  IV had a constant craving and urge since IV been up  I'm struggling  but I'm going to keep fighting  It's crazy how they manipulate your mind  IV got half my mind telling me to just quit another time and to buy a pack  and the other half knowing I need to continue to stay strong  The winner was actually 9 Congrats Mr  Otter       Kidding   Fair enough   How long did you attend before stopping  That's great to hear I'm proud of you  Let's keep it up   "I didn't have a glass of wine today    ok I'm a loser whatever makes you feel better    " Congrats on the strong yet very accurate perspecive    you have it right  Happy New Year    2017 in tha house  Why do you masturbate without porn   Bitcoins    Worthless    Send em all to me  People with compulsive skin picking are usually obsessed with clearing their pores   I think the media does this to us to sell things   Men don't worry about cleaning out their pores   I put stridex red on my skin without looking and leave them alone   They fill up again anyway on our noses   The more we clear them the bigger the pores get   That biore strip stuff has permanently enlarged some people's pores   Look it up on youtube   Anything like biore strips can   Let the alpha hyroxides do the work   People with compulsive skin picking should NOT get close enough to a mirror to do that plus we trance out and destroy our whole face cause we can't stop   It is the nature of this disorder   Alcoholics shouldn't go in bars   total trigger   applies to us with compulsive skin picking disorder  we need to stay awaywith our own triggers   Stay away from that DAMN mirror   Voice of experience here   Took me a long time to learn that and stay away from mirrors  There is an awesome free app called Skin Pick  I use it and highly recommend it     I drink fairly moderately but frequently  and my self control seems to be slipping more as time passes   Drinking has become a primary coping mechanism for anxiety  and is starting to become a focus   I didn't drink to relieve anxiety  per se  but the rest of this passage rings true  Near the end  I would say that outside of work  drinking became a primary focus  to the point where I would avoid eating at a restaurant if it didn't serve alcohol  The time between "starting to become a focus" to "became a focus" was fairly short for me  a scary slide  the pull of which was both repellant and strong    When I started my sober journey  I would have said  "I'm glad I am starting this before I suffer any real consequences " but in hindsight  I know that I did suffer real consequences  lost time for one     Do you have plans to reflect on your feelings as you go through this month sober  That might be the most telling  I'm not much of a journal keeper  but I do find it to be helpful to write about this part of my life  as you say above  it helps to lay it all out     More importantly  welcome  I will not drink with you today      Edit  spelling Welcome  It gets better  day by day  Wishing you happiness   success  I will not drink with you today   Aw  That is a sweet thing to do together on New Year's Day  You are a full day ahead of me   You betcha this is hard but we almost got a week under our belt   My anxiety is through the roof too but it is starting to lessen  The dullness and depression is starting to lift though    are you feeling that too   You are having the dreams   Not me  yet  and I am really looking forward to them   Like you  my motivation to do anything is really really low   I have to force myself   We can do this   We will do this   We are doing this   We are tough as nails and We will get through this to the other side if We want it bad enough   And I want it so bad  I can taste the freedom   We kicked cannabis to the curb   I like that  Please only post when completely sober   this is explained in the  participation guidelines  https   www reddit com r stopdrinking wiki index wiki post only while sober   for this subreddit     We recognize that many people spend months "lurking" this subreddit while drinking  You are welcome to read as much as you'd like while not sober  However  for the sake of everyone here  and for the sake of your own recovery  please only post or comment when you're sober  "Sober" means "not currently intoxicated or under the influence in any way " I will not drink today  Grind the sugar to powder it will disolve  I dont get this arguement  Im saying its better for your health to not add heat  Tell me where do all those binders and polymers and talc and shit go if they are not on your spoon  Yes they are in the rig now  Thats what you want   Me  I am a painter and illustrator  I would crave wine when creative like you say  BUT often the wine would just replace the creating  or if I did both  my artwork was shockingly bad  Lovely   You can do it   I just celebrated 2 weeks in Hawaii without a single drop    in years past I would drink practically everyday  You will enjoy you vacation so much more without alcohol  You got this    I've done both  It's so much easier to lose weight than stopping drinking  When I stopped  I ate like a pig because I didn't care about anything else  If pizza could get me through not drinking  that was it  I gained probably 10 pounds on the first months   I think you're doing it right  One thing at a time  one day at a time   The thought behind it is if you're stopping drinking and trying to lose weight  a failure at once will make you think "what's the use  I'm a fucking failure  better start drinking again"   Congrats and I wish t you the best for 2017  And not being hungover for two days  then saying f ck it and starting the train rolling all over again   Feels good  man   Hey boss  congrats on your sobriety   Mother of two year old identical twin boys here  Sobriety feels so good this time around that I hope I can stick to it forever  one day at a time  Glad to hear that you are happy  joyous and free  that is my wish for us all    simply stopping smoking isnt gonna do much youll just find another outlet for your stress  your wrong  im a completely different person wo weed  the 'stress' your referring to NO LONGER EXISTS bc it was weed that was grossly exascerbating or creating entirely  all that stress   now its gone and my life is good  concrete examples for you  high i would eat two 10 inch sandwiches and dessert after that  sober i cant even finish 1 of those sandwiches  high my waist would always be large bc its difficult to eat right stoned every day  ive done it temporarily  but its harder to eat right so i evennntually would crak    im now spending less money on food so i have less financial stress i wouldnt work as much as i should  now i do so not only do i have more money from working more  but i also have more bc im not blowing it on pot  high i wouldnt consistently be as chatty and outgoing with gorgeous new girls  now that i dont have the weed to entertain me  i am  herb being fucking illegal is a huge one too as ive had a couple legal troubles for it  obv it should be legal tho  so thats annother key area of life where i now have zero stress I almost walked into my roommates room and asked for a drag from her vape pen after I couldn't fall asleep for a few hours but I said no  and I'm happy I did  I'm almost at 2 months  I will in no way consume alcohol today  Best of luck to everyone   Happy New Years  Hi  fellow 2 weeker  Great metaphor  love it so much I saved your post  Congratulations on two weeks  Looking forward to the adventures ahead  farther and farther from the shire   DO THIS SURVEY   I SHOULD HAVE REQUESTED A SCREEN SHOT OF IT BEING COMPLETED TO WIN  First day of the new year  checking in    I don't wanna argue anymore    They're not my drugs    Y'all been told  y'all been given a simple science experiment you can try at home to understand  if you want to keep doing it wrong  I don't care    Chairs fuckface  I don't think of myself as inspirational  It's just that I found a way to do change that works for me  That means we can all find out our own way   There's still a lot to improve in my life and next year will still be a year of change  one thing at a time  one day at a time  If I'm lucky and consistent  it will be like this until I die  One thing at a time  one day at a time  Happy new year to everyone  I want to get off of suboxone this year  I think I can do it  I've been on subs for two years come April   I started at 8mg and I'm at 4mg now  I want to step down to 2mg by the end of February  My sub doc  my boyfriend  and my mom all want me to wait until I'm less stressed to step down  but honestly I think now is a good time  I'm not sure that I'm going to be less stressed at any other time this year    I also want to lose weight this year  I'm definitely overweight and having the munchies when I smoke pot isn't helping  I hope to cut down on that too  Maybe once a week instead of the two to three times a week it is now  I want to start going to the gym but I have insane gym anxiety  always have  I'm so out of shape   Thanks  Thanks guys  glad to be here with you  Actually here  not destroying myself    Sorry about the title  on a cell phone and missed my mistake  Ha  so true for me  too   When I was still failing at moderating  I thought  "what if I just drink on Fridays " And then I realized that drinking heavily 52 times a year was still an awful lot   Hi   You can do this     Some things that helped me was reading "the naked mind" there is a link in the side bar and also filling up my fridge with lots of non alcoholic drinks   I got soda water  Juice  sparkling juice  gateraids  tea ect   Also  this sub  everytime I want to drink I come read on here instead   You've  got this   We are all rooting for you     I did the same thing  Tried to quit  gave in    boom DUI   That was my rock bottom   For me  I had to join AA and see a counselor to really keep me on track  has worked great  Not drinking with you  have a great 2017   Thanks for the support  Congratulations  Good luck Thank you for your kind words I don't know much about you sir  but it seems like it may be time for a lifestyle change  Thank you  I won't drink with you all today    Happy New Year     Woohoo  I feel like most of us on this site are most excited about that  Now we get to enjoy the rest of our weekend  I had a real cool night stress free since i didnt go out to my usual new years thing  Just me  a lady  and some studio ghibli  Good stuff  Did you try tapering off the gabapentin or go cold turkey  Congratulations   I helped a friend quit around 2016's new year and it's been one year since she last smoked  Surprisingly she doesn't even crave them anymore  Welcome    I like how you have written out the warning signs and not warning signs  I found doing a cost benefit chart a useful tool  and I repeated the exercise as I went along   My initial goal was 30 days  though in the back of my mind I hoped to try for longer  and as 30 days approached I had gained a lot of insight and extended my goals    One of the critical things for me was that alcohol had become central to my coping and reward systems  so learning to live without it took time and effort to find healthier ways  having alcohol 'off the table' forced me to find those healthier ways  Once I adjusted  which took me months  I've emerged a much happier and healthier version of myself  When alcohol isn't allowed in my driving seat  I get to focus on my priorities instead  and learned to value being fully present in my life   Best wishes for a dry January      pothead couch potato  this is poor form  i literally climbed mountains on pot almost everyday for decades see not earning money etc   smoking weed at the top of the mountain was very joyful    so bc 'this didnt apply to me exactly' i felt it took me longer to quit and 'wake up to reality' everything else you said is spot on  but this particular phrase irks me  its this imprecise  and shitty language that is effectively putting negative energy into the universe when the spirit of your message is positive  not sure what point im making here  hopefully you can reply and school me lol Yay for not drinking   I too raised a glass of sparkling apple juice   Although it was at 9pm we cheered the new year in on the east coat from the west cost so we could go to bed early  Lol I'm an old lady inside and wanted to sleep   Nice one on remaining sober  Happy New Year    I live in probably the best place to celebrate NYE and I went out with my parents and it was actually fun  Saw the fireworks and a few cover bands  I've been angry sad and wanting to use all week and I def wasn't looking forward to 2017 but I'm feeling better now     I think I want to move out  I finished college 2 years ago and am working and it's time  And I can't be a hoe at my parents house   that's my biggest issue   Personally  I would not allow anyone to light up in my car while I was in the vehicle    or out of it so early in my quit   I would hope that my friends would be much more supportive of my effort in staying off weed   Even if you didn't puff on it  the second hand smoke is directly in your face        unless the windows were down   That would bother me   I understand that you didn't get the urge to join in        this time      but what about next time   Personally  I set some boundaries with my friends   I don't allow smoking in my car or in my home of any substance   That is my personal space and I deserve respect   I can always leave the building or area if I am uncomfortable with someone's actions but if they are in my space  I can't leave   You are very early in Your quit and I am only on Day 6  so we are both not on firm terra yet   Guard your Quit   Your friends will understand and if they don't  well    are they really your friends   Your post is very positive and I loved reading it   Keep Strong    I don't know if there is a definitive answer  However  I do know that WD symptoms can come in waves  There seems to be a lot of variability with this stuff  I think the best way to handle that is to set long term goals and then work patiently towards them  Patience is key  Every time I drink I go into "fuck it" mode and usually just smoke  Didn't this time  Almost 4 months now  I will not drink today  I want to  I'm bored and in a good mood   But I will NOT drink today  I will drink my bottle of Schloer  eat whatever the hell I want  even if it's fattening  but I will  Not  Drink  Today  I'm sorry you had to fend off a yucky comment like that  but it sounds like you handled it like a champ  also  I'm totally stealing "sugar sweater " Good luck   I want to stop drinking myself too  Today is day 1 for me too  I have a goal set for now of not drinking at all in January  If I get through that  I'll reassess and hopefully continue for longer   Starting at a new company on the 11th  in a manager position that is more demanding than current one so I'm hoping not to smoke up before work like I do now Sounds like a great start for 2017   I'll keep today sober right alongside you  I love beautiful chilly mornings  especially looking forwards to going for a walk tomorrow    Me too  We can do this  Here's to a successful 2017   This is basically what I was gonna write  Good on OP for recognising the projection  but god damn  That is not okay  Same here  Day 1'ers Unite   Tapering  Cold turkey was impossible  and still is  Must take 600mg night or else I don't sleep  I just enter a twilight state where I'm aware of everything around me at all times  and thus not unconscious sleeping   One year finally  haha win  I actually feel like kind of a rock star that I have lem commenting in my thread  I'll save the rest for the saturday success thread  Sure I used to convince myself that I was a high functioning alcoholic  Of course after I got sober a while I realized I was barely getting by and was just deluding myself into thinking that  nope metal i also got ham not prosciutto though and maybee some bits and bobs  It wont help you in your quest for qutting however  there is a big difference between a set back and getting back into smoking    Ive failed quitting and gone back and the first one back feels very potent and your brain or at least mine quite quickly became a stoner again   In my experience you smoke one joint and your brain will start playing tricks on you to get you to smoke another one in a very strong way     Perfect  I was an emotional hodge podge the first 3 months  Hang in there  the feelings will get better  and they beat the hell out of homelessness   Well  everyone is different     When my brother makes fun of my inability to moderate  I make fun of his man boobs  Sibling love is the best   Sounds like you have a pretty strong plan    congrats and I'm not drinking with you today  36 and never been married  I do almost feel in kind of a rush now  I want to feel what marriage is like  That level of commitment  there's even kind of a rush thinking about her taking my last name too  So weird  oh well  Seconding heading over to  a stopdrinking  I also recommend checking out AA speaker tapes  There's some amazingly inspirational stuff there spoken by the people who lived the stories  I don't go to a lot of meetings but I always enjoy listening to the stories  So happy not to be drinking today  If youre hyperactive stop being lazy and go exercise till youre sweating like a pig dont be an asshole  theres no excuse for cheating   Whilst shes away I recommend gradually reducing the quantity you smoke for the 1st week and quitting entirely on the 2nd   Geezus  yeah  hmmm  need to get my shit together  Thanks for commenting     Grab yourself a badge from the sidebar area to the right  it really keeps you motivated when the days start adding up  and it can help you to easily keep track of exactly how long you have been succeeding  And stick with it  You can do it  Four diet cokes in six hours  I was up until four and awake at eight  Tired and proud of myself  I know you feel disgusting  but you're not  You made a mistake  You're a flawed human being with great potential  as are we all    Welcome to day 1 of your new T break   You gotta punch through  You can do it  Day one for me  too   Nice  so are you still intending to quit   I too puffed a lot of weed when in my teens before learning about other drugs that "worked better" for me  I definitely have an addictive personality  I have done a lot of work on that using an "all of the above" approach of AA  doctors  shrink  psychologist  rigorous exercise  I have improved greatly but am still not "cured"  At least the addictions today are healthier and aimed at things like work  good clean fun  and speed  the 0 60 kind  that is     Welcome and good on you for speaking up   Do you have an idea of how you're going to approach things  Congratulations on getting through day 1  I've quit a million times before  too  I kept at it  and I'll keep at it  I'll quit a million more times if that's what it takes    As far as your question about what else you can do goes  a few things that have worked for me so far include     Being on this subreddit as much as possible  In a way  this subreddit is my sponsor    Delaying when I get the urge  There have been at least two days over the past week when  if I didn't delay  I would have had a drink  I tell myself  "Okay  I'm just going to wait an hour and reassess this then " Then I repeat as necessary    Playing it forward  I learned about that here  It means imagining what it would be like to have that drink  then the second  third  and so on  I even imagine the good parts that might happen at first  It might be good for the first drink or two  but after that  it's the same old time wasting  doing stupid crap  the sort of hangover the next day that reminds me what alcohol really is  poison    This isn't really a tool  but I finally got sick of what I and others here refer to as "Groundhog Day"  not sure if you've seen it  it's a movie starring Bill Murray  If you haven't seen it  I highly recommend   For me  Groundhog Day refers to the cycle of waking up every morning resolving to quit drinking only to cave and drink the same evening  Rinse  repeat  The day I quit two weeks ago  I think I finally cracked  I couldn't do it anymore  Somehow  that cycle stands out more than the hangovers  It made me just as miserable   A walk and meditation sounds great  I think I will do the same  I will not drink with you today   Good luck  They were real  And if you think about it everything is just a memory some are just newer therefore more visceral   I had a dream that my best friend and I were smoking a blunt on stage at a high school talent show while playing music and the principal was pissed  It was weird  But yes we can do it  Thanks     You're right  we can   Thanks   We're almost sober twins   Congratulations on your 308 days   Congrats  just be careful about those sneaky cravings people tend to get after a year   Stay strong my dude  I second having an approach  You'll need something OTHER than willpower to do this  Check in  Meetings  Books  Podcasts  Audio books    Power on  Get up  Brush off  I won't drink with you today   Free activities to beat the boredom  1  the library  Too far  Check out Guttenberg press online  Or if you prefer  Librivox has lots of audio books   2  Walk  Walk  Walk   3  clean like a mad person  4  journal  I resisted that much 'me' out there in plain sight  resisted it vehemently  but it ultimately helped after I stuck with it for a few days   I've loved following your journey this past year  thank you for sharing  HAPPY NEW YEAR    Hi and first off well done kicking the cigarettes habit  I also quit smoking using a vaporiser and recently went nicotine free  It can be done very easily  I see you're in 12mg juice right now   honestly  I wouldn't drop to 0mg just yet  12mg is still quite high and there is a definite period of withdrawal  for me the first week was roughest   You'd be better off getting 6mg juice and stick with that for a while  then get 3mg  stick with that for a while and so on until you get to the lowest nicotine juice you can get  Maybe 1 5 if you can    Once I got to that point I bought some PG  propylene glycol  with no nicotine in it and some 30ml needle top bottles for ejuice  I then filled it with the 1 5mg juice  and every time I refilled my tank I replaced the 1 5mg juice with the PG  until it was entirely nicotine free  At that point  I switched to 0mg juice and I haven't looked back  The first week will be tough  as I mentioned  but it's nothing like cigarette withdrawal and if you step down the nicotine over time the withdrawals will be minimum  Best of luck to you  It's funny that you say that because the first thing I did when I grabbed them was smell them  lol  Who knows what I was actually thinking  Thank you for reading my rambling  I will not drink with you  Love animals  Go to the shelter and pet animals  They are good for your soul Na a dont want it again lol just had one joint to myself and wondering if i was back to square one in terms of withdrawal symptoms and such  Thank you  And no  going on willpower now   I read Allen Carr  This Naked Mind  and Alcohol Lied To Me last year    I loved those books and they helped for a little while    but it never lasted long     I drink about a bottle of wine and a six pack of beers daily  Oh I am 100  sure that I will never smoke again  It does not interest me at all lol   Honestly when people pressure you to drink like that I think you have full license to make anything up   Say you torched a police car the last time you got drunk  you get terrible  uncontrollable diarrhea when you drink  whatever   Good for you on not drinking  Thank you   Thanks  you're very nice   I have to work on not regretting the past  especially the wasted opportunities   Only thing we can do is not waste opportunities now right    Shit  I just convinced myself to go on a trip     Congratulations on 85 days   I'lOl raise my whiskey diet breakfast too you  but you can keep your damn Dewar's  I will not drink today   Happy New Year everyone  I'm not sure how it's wasted if it's in the syringe and then my veins  but whatever     Look  please stop this  You know NOTHING about me  my life or what goes on within it   I do not  nor did I ever say  that I was 'unique'  I said everybody's different  which they are  I drink too much  fully aware of this  I am hurting my body  fully aware of this also   I am sorry that you had a rough time   I am not you   Please stop assuming things  thank you  Thanks so much for the reply  I was talking to somebody recently at the gym and they said "welp  the e cigs dont have all the other gunk that real cigs do  Do you think your body has had enough time to adjust to life without all that gunk " And that's what inspired me to switch  Honestly  I wasnt 100  sure what level I needed to start with e cigs  but I knew I had to jump from the real ones  Thanks   I felt like it was rambling  but it helps to write it down   Congratulations on your 118 days   Drinking moar currently  vodka and pulpy orange juice  it's terrible  Fellow DFW fan here  I'll take the Capital T Truth any day over the fog that I lived in every night when I drank  Congratulations on your 2 years  Glad you're here with us  I will not drink with you today  Lol  Drunk you was probably really proud for finding such good hiding places  Rest in peace  other sock   Sounds like a great new years tho  grats  The weird part is i truly love these women  i can imagine entire lives with them  christmas next to a tree with them  valentines day  sunday mornings cooking her breakfast  My lips my promise but my heart is a whore    Yay  And I have 60 days today  Sorry bud  It's just the truth  Maybe it's just me  But I'm telling you what I experience  That's awesome    great willpower story  Quitting weed and booze together is also very impressive  especially because so many people look at weed as "harm reduction" as a replacement for alcohol  For some people  that is totally fine and they can handle it  others just fill one vice's void with the other at greater degrees  I think it's awesome you are committed to avoiding mind altering substances and sticking to your guns  Blizzard hired psychologists to the team to make this game addictive   I'm sure that they used another word in their conference meetings  like immersive or competitive or something    You can read my struggle with Cancerwatch from my fist submission to this sub until my 15 day report  I'm sure you'll be able to relate  I'm a bit past a year   I've had a lot of cravings  but I've associated cigs with so many bad things that they are just weird moments   Brain will bring up cigs and then quickly bring up how lame and terrible they are    Then I move on wih life   It helps associating even one with being back to the addiction and the grossness  There is a saying that a miracle is something that is above nature  supernatural   It is also said that to receive the miracle you too must ascend beyond nature  Thank you  I've been recovering for a long time from a difficult surgery  so having the energy and motivation to set up my workspace is wonderful   Functioning drinker to me was a window  I was doing fine while drinking so there was no worry or concern  Then it progressed to blackouts and being unable to stop  Had to stop Sure  i'll pack on another 365 with you   I'm with you  Fantastic   One of the hardest things for me is getting back into the projects I love   Care to share what you're working on  Thanks friend  Being sober is the best gift I've ever given myself  I'm gonna keep on keeping on  The Problem is i life in a Rural Area  There isen't alot of that movies  People  and also i do not have Freinds  When i can do something like running insted of running i ride my bike   there isent alot of people where i life  theres no movie theater  arcades etc    Oh of course this is one reason I quit  cos I knew it was only a matter of time be it months  years  decades  before I reached that stage  I think guysober was just offering his perspective about his own experience   You're starting here at day 1 and asking for perspective  from what I could tell   When you get to day 428 you might have a different take on it all   Either way  I'm not drinking with you today   Happy New Year    I was spending too much money  gaining too much weight  and I disliked the foggy head that I'd get 3 4 times a week from it  It disrupted my sleep a bit  too  It's interesting   I picked up "Easy Way to Stop Drinking"   It was not a perfect answer but the change in mindset was invaluable   I did eventually quit drinking  and now I'm quitting smoking   I would highly recommend the series as a starting point  No  I asked if anyone else here did what I did  What HE did was come into the thread and imply I thought I was special and above being called an alcoholic  I did nothing of the sort   He said he was 'drunk all the time'  I've never been drunk outside of the hours mentioned  He clearly drunk more than me and I am GLAD that he's fixed his problem  but he made judgments about me that were frankly  incorrect  Don't know about you dude  working out makes me even more horny Yup  alcohol will do all those shitty things when you drink in excess  Glad we're not drinking today     I have to reset my badge for the umpteenth time today as well    Everybody's sober muscles are weak at first  It takes daily practice to get strong     Hang in there  I'll not drink with you today  2 5 days is great  Today is a new day   What are you going to do with that whiskey  I would drain pour before giving in to temptation  How long has it been since you smoked   Yes  What you describe could have been written by me  Only difference is I would regularly fall asleep in front of the TV and hubby would wake me to tell me to go to bed     I have decided that I am drinking too much too regularly  My job is hard and I know that the 'fog' I feel due to the wine and not great sleep doesn't help me do my job  but I still do it well     I  can't do moderation   I am an all or nothing person  So after thinking about giving up drink for a few years I have decided to do it for January and keep going into Feb and take it from there    Not clear from your post what you plan to do   Apologies if I missed it   But good luck whatever you decide to do   All the best  What bothers me the most is my brain automatically assuming a cigarette is coming   My hand checks my pocket   Where did I put my   oh no You definitely aren't alone  lots of people have experienced Gabapentin WD  Luckily I haven't felt anything significant in the terms  I'm prescribed 900mg 3x a day but take about a week long break in between scripts  But I could see the WD being severe if it were taken daily for months on end  Thanks for tge reply  I went over this     I took 4 500 mg day for 3 years  So I'm certainly big pharma's guinea pig  This is sound advice  I had developed an annoying habit of punching holes right through my perfectly fine walls  Not very charming  I curbed that shit  cause it was rediculous  I managed to hole punch while laying down on my back  arguing in bed  Im not that bad anymore  still have a problem with my bedroom door though  Something about the way that smug fucker looks at me  just can't stop kicking it  Well then good luck to you too   But the decision has already been made  No need to apologise to anyone here PB  A lot of us have failed numerous times  I know I have   Personally I would pour that whiskey down the drain to get rid of the temptation  Hope you manage to get through the rest of the day  Either way  you will always be welcome here  Take care  x Love this      Happy New Year  Well  let's see  I have been able to successfully mother three  young  kids  I make their lunches  I'm their class parent  I make their dinners  I do all their laundry and I make sure to say I love them  I take them to and from after school programs  soccer  Pokemon Go contests  I do what I need to do as their mother  I am also a pretty OK spouse  My husband and I don't fight  We're OK  But  up until recently I also consumed a bottle of wine  sometimes a bottle and a half every single night for the last two years  Every day  I looked forward to my wine  I yearned for it every day  But I was still able to do my job  I never drove my kids to soccer practice drunk  I never took them to after school meetings drunk  I was never drunk during a playdate  although BBQs were another story   I did the job  I wasn't exceptional  If there were another sober mother  she'd most likely have gotten the raise and promotion long before me  But I did OK  I wasn't ever fired  No one ended up injured   I'm only 8 days sober this time  This time I have a plan that seems to be working  I will say  already  I'm a better mother than I was 8 days ago  I am no longer rushing to get them off to bed so I can finish my bottle of wine  I am no longer saying  "Just one book tonight  honey  I'm tired "  I can't believe I cut out reading books to get my drink on    I didn't have the energy most days to take them out to the park  or the desire really  But I would sit and watch a Pixar movie with them  pop popcorn and bring them snacks and treats  We'd cuddle as I'd sip my wine    Again  I'm on 8 days  but things are vastly different  VASTLY  Which means it's only going to get better  I've already noticed their attitude  as well as my husband's  has changed toward me as well    The VERY LONG POINT I'm trying to make is that I didn't know the ME as a mother until I cut the shit  And now that I have a clearer head on it  I realized how I could have done SO MUCH BETTER    I'm a distant runner  I'll use a runner's metaphor  Instead of simply finishing the race and crossing the finish linewhich I have always been able to doI am now setting personal bests every single time I run    But  yes  I would consider myself a highly functioning drinker  But I much prefer this highly functioning non drinker for the time being  She's setting personal bests left and right   Feel the fear and act with faith   After all  faith is simply fear that has said its prayers   Thank you    It's good to be clean    Still working on those character defects though    It's a bitch    Wow  painful    You'd understand if you were a drug addict    You're not  these people aren't  that's cool    I don't wanna fucking argue    This isn't cadebate    Some people got caught spinning bullshit  oh well    That's drunks for ya    No biggie  Ps if you put concealer only  no foundation etc   just over the spots lightly   put alcohol on you hands before using your hands to put it on a clean face and use a fresh new tube of concealer like Physicians Formula "Conceal Rx"    comes in a small tan tube  like a small neosporin tube   10 or so  it won't show and you will be fine   That's what I did  Have you tried the 30 Day Sobriety Solution  I downloaded it on Xmas Day thanks to a fellow SDer and it's been amazing for me     Mine are identical boys as well   How's it going at 2 yrs  Be sure to rub it in   It's less fun if you don't gloat a bit      Damn  that sucks  Are you in school  Dude I was driving all over looking for checkpoints    powerful Awesome quote  I should tape it to my cereal box so I remember it each morning   Yeah  don't do that  I'm a drunk like all of us    Cheers mate  It's an     Art  http   www lung org about us blog 2016 07 popcorn lung risk ecigs html   Didnt know much about it so I googled it   Thought I'd leave a link to the info   Diacetyl is bad   Mmmmkkk  also there are some other chemicals that cause 8t  The people who obsess about my not drinking are the worst  NYE was "C'mon just have a beer  you have to have a beer with me  have a beer buddy"  It's like  what the fuck is your problem  how does my having a beer have any affect on your fun times  Drop it  I'm drinking club soda in a Koozie  just imagine it's beer and shut up  I don't want a drink  who cares what my reasons are  Some people get so insecure around sober folks  In the past when I've just been taking a break I've actually poured out beer and filled the cans with water just to get people off my friggin back   You do know my DOC right  And my other sub  That Fash and I mod  Awesome goals  Qui  I wish you nothing but the best  2017 is gonna be a good year  I am a very calm drunk but weed makes me want to throw punches  Kind of opposite from most people  Is there an underlying reason for the anger  Alcohol doesn't make anyone angry  but it does shut down the frontal cortex that normally keeps our lizard brain in check  You know what you need  Your very own "bottle cap"  yeah but it's still bad for yo health no matter what age Well if you want to go the opposite route of drink moar  fuck the shooters get a few small flasks and fill em up from handles because fuck me  20 fucking dollars a day in shooters what in the actual fuck I mean for fucks sake seriously fuck Gotcha   If it makes you feel any better  I graduated Summa Cum Laude  have no debt outside of my mortgage  am happily married  recently earned a promotion  etc  all at the height  eh   one of the heights  of my drinking   So I understand the idea of functioning highly while also knowing I have a serious problem with alcohol   It's kind of like living a double life for me   My dad was the same way   successful and not many people knew about the drinking  but it caused major issues nonetheless   A lot of my problems start to abate when I don't drink  tried my hand at sobriety several times in the past    I feel calmer  more creative  less guilt      Stick with it   I'm curious to see what changes you see in your life because when your life is pretty functional some of those big tells aren't there  got a job  got out of debt  etc      But even after just over a week of not drinking this time I feel this flicker of excitement about being alive starting to come back again       I really recommend thinking about how you are going to achieve your goal   There are things you can do   If you want recommendations  look through the posts here  there are loads of ideas   Some things I experienced initially  and while I don't know your situation and everyone is different  I was roughly drinking the same amount as you each day  include difficulty sleeping  night sweats  insatiable hunger for sweets  boredom  and wild mood swings   It helps to be aware of these things so you recognise them if   when they occur   I'm not an AA person but others find it very helpful   SMART etc    For me  posting here a lot has been great  And the daily check in sets a great tone for the day   And I found a counsellor so I can address the reasons behind the drinking   I'd also recommend mindfulness   meditation to learn to cope with racing thoughts  frustration  and overthinking things   And maybe think about what you are going to do in situations that are likely to arise  pressure   questions from friends and family  stressful situation etc    Whatever you decide to do  you don't have to rely on willpower alone  for me  that's simply not enough  if you don't feel that's going to work for you   All the best  I hope to see you around here for a long time to come   And I will not drink with you today  When I stopped  I spent a ton of time here reading  posting and commenting  Those are all great for the moment to moment but I agree that willpower by itself is a tough struggle  I rely on therapy  but there are other resources   AA  smart and so on   People are willing to help   I will not drink with you today  You'll never catch me      Chairs  Yeah  I know people with 10 000 hours   I still think that it's not worth it to spend so much time in the game  though  With 1000 hours I could've refined my drawing skills  learned to cook hundreds of meals  or burned lots of fat  Certainly not  Her alcoholism is way beyond the point where she can use needle and thread  I will not drink today  I posted in another response but one other one I got lately was "I don't trust people who don't drink"  What the hell does that mean  Sober people are untrustworthy  Right because it's sober people who do all the fucked up shit we read about and talk about here  it's sober people who shirk responsibility  cause trouble  get in fights  make messes  etc  Definitely look out for those people  those shifty eyed sober people looking to take advantage of the drunks  The funny part is  I stop drinking because I don't trust my drunk self   I recently started with AA and my sober journey and yeah  the spiritual stuff in the big book is a bit off putting   I don't put much really any  faith in religion but I do have faith in people  my higher power is that gained through community and fellowship  I cannot do this alone  but with the support of r stopdrinking and AA I am not alone  I can do this  We can do this  I will not drink with you today  Cheers to a sober 2017   Take it 1 day at a time  and go get yourself some good candy  it really helps  Good for you  Happy new year   This was my second sober new years as well  I took a trip out to the lake with my girlfriend and a couple other couples  Instead of picking one unlucky drunk driver  I was able to make sure everyone could safely hop around to the different parties we all wanted to check out  It was a great night and I had an awesome time with everyone while drinking a couple energy drinks  We are all hanging out at my place now laughing about last night's shenanigans and getting ready to hit the hot springs  I'm very thankful for having such a great group of friends that understand my decision not to drink  I still get people asking how I'm able to have fun but I'm able to brush those conversations off  Congrats on your sobriety and have a great 17   It's going to be another great year  thank you very much for listening to my story  I needed to write it down and get it out   Read  Find a book that interests you and give it some time  It takes some time to transition from the constant audio visual stimulation that video games provide  but for me reading was the nail in the coffin of my video game addiction   This is day 6 for me and my mom   We both stopped on Christmas  that was our gift   We both are doing cold turkey   It's affecting us both completely  different   My mom says she's lost a best friend  so that explains her feelings mentally to me   Me  I feel as though I got rid of a back stabbing friend  so I actually feel pretty good     Don't know if I'm too late  but sign me up I used to play hours of Overwatch a day  and the thing about it is that like u doognmad2 I solo queued a lot and used it as a simulator to distract myself from actual things I was supposed to be doing instead of playing with friends or for fun without the competitive attitude for 1 2 hours a day   The fact that I viewed competitive gaming as such a big part of my life made me look back on all those hours and wonder  "What the fuck am I doing with my life " Seeing people approach their twenties thirties and telling me that they're no longer into gaming because they have friends and family  and seeing myself so out of touch with reality and the people around me make me feel like I should stop gaming  It's not the social pressure  I don't feel like I'm an outcast because I play  I just feel like I'm missing out on a very big part of my life because I'm playing  and it gets harder to moderate sometimes   I don't quit gaming completely  Most of the games I play nowadays are just for fun  and the only games I have that I don't uninstall are single player games that last 2 hours instead of games like Dota and League that can make someone play for up to thousands of hours  Occasionally I reinstall Dota 2  play a game or two  and realize that I've just wasted 1 hour and feel "eh  this is why I decided to stop playing in the first place"  Even if I won it doesn't really mean anything   The only friends of mine who still play games frequently are those that don't do well in school  myself included  and this is why I really want to take this whole thing seriously and snap out of it Can you not try to make friends there  I'm in America where most people are pretty friendly so idk how it is where you're at but most people are pretty nice  Go and talk to people about things you're interested in and I pretty much guarantee you'll make some friends   I don't really think there is a thing as "too much coffee   But the shoes on the other hand   that can get expensive   Cheers to not drinking  For the next couple of weeks   r cripplingalcoholism is participating in our yearly population survey   Please take a few moments to answer some questions and tell us a bit about yourself    https   goo gl forms GyV881lSdjynukUP2  Please see  our stickied thread  https   www reddit com r cripplingalcoholism comments 5fv5hb time to take the

cripplingalcoholism  if you have any questions or concerns   I've personally have been starting to take up to learning the ukulele Congratulations  That is so wonderful for you  Really proud  Keep it up  I'll not drink with you today  Best of luck   Totally understand    My sister is  12 years sober  I don't think I'll ever compare to the level of crazy drunken antics that she got up to  but after my college years and letting my health go to shit I've taken many extended breaks from alcohol  Now  when I reflect  I often end up looking to my sister for help and I just wonder how she did it  She stopped drinking cold turkey at 23  a time when crazy partying wasn't that unusual  I'm 33 now and go between months up to a year off from drinking and moderating well for a while  then drinking a bit too much  etc  I remember making fun of her for being a loser when I was just in my 20's and now she's practically a hero to me  It's funny how that works    Congratulations on your sobriety and good luck moving forward  Stay strong and maybe someday you can be the rock for other folks in the same place you are now   After being a smoker for 20 years reading that book made it easy to stop  14 years ago and I've never been tempted to start again   Give your husband my best   remind him not to have even 1  Absolutely  Strength in numbers  Here we go  Have a cold shower after working out   If you want to cheat then go ahead I'm just saying you're a scumbag if you do   I wasn't drunk all the time  I am bummed you left the thread  I was a lot like you  probably drank less than you actually  And  yes  I considered myself highly functioning  But I could have done better  That's indisputable  with myself    But I'm guessing it's KIND of eating away at you a bit  which is what was happening with me as well  SO you stopped by  I hope you don't go away  Many of us  all we want to do is help because so many people here before us helped us  Anyway  come back  I can see being sober would help me deal with issues I haven't dealt with properly  because drinking lets me avoid them   My personal goals would be  attainable     I wouldn't hurt the people I care about   I'd be a better role model for those around me   Drinking turns me in to a hermit  My social life would improve   I'd be happier and more satisfied with my responsible decision making   I'm at day 1  again  Making the most of today is definitely doable sober  Better late than never     D you sound like you've got a good head on your shoulders  That can take you far  Drink more water to get rid of nausea   eat things like yogurt and high Fibre foods like cereal   For some people eating fruit really helps too  Good luck buddy That poor soul at 3 20  I think I've been that guy  Congrats  I am headed that direction myself  Hoping to get back down to 180 175 in the new year   Just need to stop putting so much cream in my coffee     Congrats   Just remember that it's no friend at all and it will stab you in the back the first chance it gets   And it will come back to try to be friends again   Remember  it's an evil non friend We managed to find a detox mental health facility that will take her Medicare  We also found a rehab place that my state will pay for an in patient stay since my Mom's income level is low   I know the feeling  I'm on my third handle of whiskey in three days  I passed out early last night because I was smashed  Woke up at 5am and got drunk again  Passed out  Woke up at 3pm  Now I'm drinking again   What a great feeling congratulations     I lost 40 pounds with the help of  r loseit   Take a look when you're ready  I found some caffeine free tea helped my nausea  Keep trying to eat though  Even small amounts of food will help   Once this sub grew people started mass down voting people  Somebody went and downvoted all of my posts here once  IDK though  just a theory  OMG  "sugar sweaters" for teeth  This is awesome   Congrats on staying sober  I have a YouTube channel that I've had since 2009  I've been lucky that I have very few videos   20   but spent a lot of time learning SEO so I have something like 2 5 or 3 million views   Regardless  I'm kicking myself for not working harder on it  Most definitely attributed to smoking  I could probably be making the salary I do at my job right now if I wouldn't have given up so many times  No longer will that be the case  I've made significant progress in the last 3 4 weeks and don't plan on stopping  According to my flair  today would be 366 days  Even attended an open bar wedding where I was the best man and didn't touch any alcohol   D I know it's in my head but I feel selfish when I don't drink   People are at the bar and I'm drinking a soft drink and I feel like people think I'm being a dick   Then I get lecture after lecture about moderation   I don't have enough ammo in my mind to not drink and I'm looking for other peoples suggestions or personal reasons to realise why it's better to not drink  Congratulations  What a way to start the new year     Thanks  I am quite motivated today  I'll jump on Reddit as soon as I have cravings  Thanks  Thank you    I could care less about whos right  You are spreading bad info on heating pills  People get sick and die from bad info like this  This is the only reason I joined this convo  cause shit like this gets people hurt even dead needlessly  Happy New Year  I will not drink with you today    Hi5 for nearing 30 days   Thank you  Way to go on 88 days   Some friends are really fucking tolerant  I slapped a close friend in the face on NYE 2012 because     I actually can't remember why  but at the time it was very important  Happy New Year    I've gota lovely cross stitch that says "complaints to the cook could be hazardous to your health"  Its great  The one I've been to starts with a lot of readings about the 8 fold path and then there is a 20 minute guided meditation  We alternate weekly between reading from the book  Journaling and having somebody share their story   The meeting is open for sharing after that but it doesn't go around in a circle or anything   if you want to share go for it but nobody is forced to  People generally share how they apply Buddhism to their recovery or some aspect of their meditation that night  We close it with another 5 minute meditation  I wouldn't be too concerned with not  being a big enough drinker tbh they rarely focus on their history of drinking and instead focus on their recovery and what they are doing to move forward  Thank you  Happy New Year  Thank you  I'm lucky that work will be really busy  My plan is to see the crazy ones on a school night with my "work early" exit plan  Friday and Saturday are for the ones I know are sober  or at least will understand what I'm working with    Happy 2017 to you  too  Sign me up   We're so insightful when we're drunk that we have to push it down everyone's throat  We're so not like that old drunk sitting on that stool everyday babbling uninteresting stories to a bored waitress    until we realize we're that old drunk  Congrats  Alcohol is such a sneaky source of calories  I don't miss those either   Happy new years  Im starting off with just 41 days under my belt   Look forward to having a great year  Just a suggestion  my daughter and I do this  we advertise our Uber free ride promotion code in facebook groups we are in  she leaves cards around places she eats or frequents  and just any way to get your code out  You can even put it on the uber website and people will use it  For every person that uses it you get a free 15 dollar ride or off a ride if it more than fifteen bucks  Takes a little work but my daughter goes back and forth to school exclusively free    You sound a bit like me  in that I've been doing it for years  drinking most nights although mostly not a massive amount   The reasons I want to stop are I'm tired  I need to loose weight and I've become more stressed and negative  feel like I'm not the person I used to be  much of this is down to alcohol   I'll join you in not drinking today  sign me up   Thanks for the recommendations and for not drinking with me today  I looked up an AA meeting today  and went all the way to their door  but I didn't have the guts to go inside    I will definitely hang out in this sub a lot  and hopefully I can get enough courage to talk about my problem with people in real life  Boredom will be a big problem for me I suspect  I am not sure yet how to fill my evenings that I usually spend drinking  The main my opioid alkaloids have a short half life  2 5 hours for one and 3 5 for the other big one  But  there are plenty of other alkaloids that seems to have serotonigenic effects  Also norepinephrine  So kratom wd is a combination of mild mu opioid  ssri and snri withdrawals  These may take longer for your brain to normalise than the opioid receptors Sound advice   Congratulations  It feels so great waking up happy  34 years deserves extra applause  i will not drink today ' You don't know shit    Reported you to  r opiates    It's embarassing that you're modding such a sub    Fucking cornstarch binders ain't killing people you fucking twit  1  My health  hangovers ruin my eating and exercise habits  2  My mental health  now I try to actively deal with my problems instead of numbing them   3  I want to be responsible for all of my actions   4  I don't want to wake up in the morning with no recollection of what happened the night before   5  My bank balance   6  I want to know that I can have fun

encouragement feel free to send me a pm  You got this  It's the first day of your new cigarette free life Congratulations   What an accomplishment   Weed does seem to be a young person drug  I know a few people who smoked loads of weed in their teens  early twenties and don't like it any more  even though they still drink  I quite often wonder why this is  Maybe because as you get older  you become more serious and anxious about life and want a drug that just makes you feel good  rather than making you feel strange and possibly more anxious    Absolutely  I'm with you   r addiction That's fucking great  This is all I do for fun  Whiskey and cross stitch  One day I hope I can just do this full time and not have a grown up job    Man  10 years  I can't imagine myself doing that  Congratz  "I'm on a diet" or "I'm on antibiotics medication" seem to be easy go tos to shut the conversation down quickly   I have recently transitioned to "my body just doesn't tolerate alcohol well anymore "  If asked for more details  I'll mention I was having issues with my blood pressure and sleeping   which is true although it's just the tip of the iceberg   That's been working pretty well for me  Haha wow  that's a new one   Sign me up please Signing in  Im in  and this time ill CRUSH IT  Congratulations   That is amazing    I hope I can do a year too  day 1 for me    What are the most common symptoms associated with ssri snri w d  I hadn't considered that it was working on two levels  but that makes sense   Because ringing in the New Year by drinking what is classified as a poison makes one a winner     Thank you  I'll try the diarrhea one next  I'm getting one year on New Year's Day 2018     hopefully Girl  you're a better man than me  Can't say I'd have been able to hold my tongue

drink today    Sign me up please  A book called LA Ice  About addicts in rehab  Very good  have read it several times  Not how to get sober or even sobriety  Just about two people  ups  downs  love  fear  hope   when you break down quickly get rid of any remaining crumbs so you won't be tempted to smoke again I've been trying to get sober for ages  This is my day one too  Good luck to you  I'm exactly the same  Good luck  Best of luck to ya  but I'd imagine making a living off it would be a bit destructive   Constantly taking orders for shitty whitisms that like a tide against rocks slowly erodes your joy of casual disdain  Great job  I have some friends who are in the Colorado cannabis cultivation business and have access to some mind bending weed  My MO was to supplement here and there with it  When I decided to get sober after Thanksgiving I decided that sober meant sober  no smoking  no edibles  nothing  A head clear of any intoxicant  other than caffeine  of course  is my goal  I'm glad to read stuff like this to know I'm not the only one  Again  good job  I've found that when I'm hungover I'm pretty tempted to crack one out too  To be honest  I've been pretty frantic with trying to keep busy doing different tasks   like planning cooking or doing exercise  Got some new cookery books so I'm quite enjoying testing out the recipes   I just keep on remembering how depressed I was after during PMO streaks  To be honest  PMO ing really didn't help the depression I felt when I was suffering a hangover anyway  Awesome   good to hear  hopefully she is ready and willing to participate  she will need to be fully involved in the treatment program or she will get booted  people at Medicare will be reviewing her progress and she will get kicked out if she is not actively participating in the program  great start and Happy New Year  Fucking Pokemon   Happy 2017  everyone  I won't drink with you today  day 1 reporting in Very inspiring and helpful  thank you so

subscribe and share my channel happy new years Thanks for the suggestion  Yeah I need to find a better alternative to caffeine  doesn't help that I work at a coffee shop  haha  I remember reading somewhere that an okay tasting  but packed full of nutrients smoothie makes a noticable difference Why does drinking destroy friendships  Because you vaped  If your friends can't accept weed  why are you friends with them   This was a pretty serious intervention  All of my help is predicated on her making it through her treatments and making her meetings and appointments  It's going to be hard  just about everyone else in her life is an abuser or enabler  I really don't know how much of a chance she has  but she'll be dead in a couple of years without any help  She went from 220 lbs to 105lbs in two years  She's a shell of who she used to be  Thanks for the thorough response    Oh  I don't think I would ever take the plunge and pursue it  I have a job that I actually like at and architecture firm  Sewing is just really therapeutic for me  taking orders would probably fuck it up for me  95  of the time it is vitriolic shit that I make look pretty  Another hobby is sewing dog clothing  I swear this makes me sound like way more of a saddo than I am   who voted my comment down  explain why you negative asshole  some of us are actual alcoholics  You are a fucking idiot   Shit  I've done some of these stone cold sober  i life at America to  CA In fact   where i life  There isent alot of people  it's a small rural area  i attempt making some sort of Friend ship at school but it never worked out  In town there isent alot of people and and allot people who are at my school are stoners            I actually posted this morning about how I woke up with an urge  but I had to be at work in 30 minutes  It doesn't always work out that way  but having any obligation like that can make it so you simply don't have time I know nothing about Pokemon  Haven't even poked a man   Brilliant stuff  thanks for posting   I'm going to check out the wellness plan in the morning  looks good  Good luck  seems you have answer s to many of your own questions  may have to leave the job  Plenty of people will tell you  "Oh you will never make it if you don't quit"   fuck them  if you really want to stay clean you will  if you don't you won't  it's really as simple as that  build your support network  go to meeting s  work the program to the best of your ability just try to focus on your situation  to many people in NA AA try to lump every body together stay away from them and find

awesome way to start the year  My wife and I just had a nice long walk in the winter sunshine too  Keep on rockin' in '17 Normally when I don't text people on holidays it's because I assume they are busy with friends family  I'll speak to them another time  or I'm trying to avoid my phone while I spend quality time with family  Don't take it personally  I'm sure if any of your friends family read this they'd be heart broken to know they inadvertently hurt your feelings   Not drinking with you today  Love this      Happy new year  Thank you  And thanks for sharing the 8 dimensions of wellness  Looks to be a great resource   I began my journey today  and I know that New Years resolutions are a bit 'cliche'  but for me they hold great significance   Reading this sub the last few days gives me inspiration  and you lot all seem so happy and encouraging  I am looking forward to it  I will not drink with you today  As somebody who found this sub last January  I'd like to say to those just finding it now  The members of Stop Drinking collectively altered my whole perspective on alcohol in 2016    My aim was to take a break for a few weeks  then moderate  Members here helped me realise that moderation is an impossible dream for me  When I control it I don't enjoy it and vice versa     Many areas of my life have improved greatly during the last 12 months  If you're reading this knowing that you need to change the relationship you have with alcohol  stick around as you're welcome and the answers you seek probably lie within the posts somewhere   Also know that I will not drink with you today   So there seems to be a lot to work through for you here   First off  I'd suggesting speaking with your sponsor  and definitely value their opinion much higher than mine in regards to what I'm about to tell you   What it seems like is that you're working on sobriety at the same time that you're working on loving yourself  and that's not uncommon  and I've found that sobriety and loving yourself are often correlated in measurements of success   You are an amazing person who would be a valuable friend to have   You just don't believe this yourself yet  and you may have used alcohol to hush your fears about this insecurity   I was lucky in that I was rather comfortable with myself when I first started trying to quit alcohol  but I had been in the military  and I can tell you that before the military that I didn't have that confidence to value myself  and I hid that insecurity behind alcohol and weed and would pass out on other people's couches and consider them friends when I barely knew anything about them  and they about me   I don't even think about them now   I also had very good friends  but imbibing alcohol and drugs was the primary aspect of our friendship   These friends disappearing hurt the most  and I think we both fought to keep the friendship going  but in the end  there wasn't much we enjoyed doing together once alcohol was out of the picture  and we both just stopped trying   Finally are the friends that I had before that stuck with me   Some of them didn't know what to do when they were going to be around alcohol and if they should bring me along or not   Initially  not bringing me around was probably the best call  but they talked with me about it  and I could make the decision if I could handle joining  or if it would be something that would key into some of my triggers  i e  drinking games  and I would politely decline but clearly state that I was touched by the invitation and would enjoy joining them for other events   And eventually we grew together and they became better friends with me being sober   This is a bit off the rails  but what I'm trying to communicate is that I think you're lamenting the loss of friends that may not be able to stay friends with you as you go through your sobriety  and that's okay   Right now your sole purpose is to focus on your sobriety  to focus on you   Over time  you'll become proud of your sobriety  and wear it as a badge of honor  and as something that defines you  and this is the best way I've found for my sobriety to end up protecting me   I don't worry about people that wouldn't invite me to a party because they're concerned about my sobriety because in the end  that's my badge protecting me from those kinds of parties and those kinds of people that believe everyone at the party should be getting drunk   Meanwhile  you'll be making new friends  and developing stronger bonds with friends that like you for you   And you will  and I swear to you on this  you will learn to love yourself and to value yourself  and to value the people that are honored to call you a friend   They say something for working out at the gym  that you should think of during these dark days   I didn't say it would be easy  but I'm telling you that it will be worth it   Good luck   Stay Sober   One day at a time     P S   Your mom sounds awesome  and you shouldn't worry about spending too much time with her because she values you when you're sober   You should build upon that  and hopefully you'll be able to see yourself as positively as your mom sees you   Good luck  Congratulations on your first step towards a smoke free future  Wow that is awesome and I am needing to do the same thing  I put on 40 pounds   don't sleep because I drink too much  I care for my mom full time who has dementia so it's taking a toll on me   If you have any advice to help me get started please let me know  I am going to try the calendar with the X that shows each day I have not had a drink    I really appreciate the help  It looks like our local detox facility will take her medicare  I was worried about having to pay out a ton just to save my mom's life  Valium is very nice to have in place of booze  Also very addictive  Is rehab an option  Sounds like you need want to dry out but can't trust yourself to do it  Is your promise to her a strong enough motivation to actually do anything  Also   if you're going to jail it's a good idea to detox asap because I don't think they will be sympathetic to your withdrawal symptoms at all in there   That's my 2 cents  good luck fucker  Very low abv beer while in public  I dislike being noticeably drunk in public  Nice pale ale  Kissed a pretty girl just after midnight  total stranger so that was nice  At the party   neat dark rum  which is unusual for me  Quite nice  may make a habit of it   Yourself   Edit  yes it was all very nice  I totally agree   I have realized one of my pitfalls was that I knew I had an issue and needed to change  but right now I'm having this unusually stressful problem and alcohol is really helping me cope and I will work on drinking less later   But my a hole addict brain could make any little hiccup into something that qualified as unusually stressful  so by its logic  I would continue drinking my way through all of life's inconveniences and challenges   It actually worked the same for happy events and celebrations   I can't quit NOW  we're about to go to the beach with friends   Since I was pretty functional and didn't have much for what others would consider rock bottom moments  so I had to pick a time to hunker down  tackle it  and be ready to be uncomfortable for a couple of weeks   Turning 40 was a good excuse  and a couple weeks later  I overdid it on a camping trip and had some undesired consequences which made me feel emotionally and physically like crap   I seized that as my rock bottom and used it to motivate me to quit for just a month to start  but it's gaining momentum for me   I'm glad we were able to take that next step after acknowledging the problem   Happy New Year   I will not drink with you today  Thanks  Try telling me that ten years ago  Hence the 'day at a time' adage to keep one's perspective in check  Hey congrats on a year   Have a great sober 2017 too  alright  im in for the month  sign me up starting now  It's really encouraging to hear your story   thank you for sharing  Alcoholism runs rampant in my family and I'm the only one  even in the extended tree  that doesn't drink  Even though my family doesn't understand my sobriety right now  I continue to go high even when they go low   It all comes down to choice  a lot of good suggestion s that I won't regurgitate  taking a break maybe in order  That is how I manage  I also don't drink and stay away from opiate s  I use a few weeks a month and that's it  I can control myself enough to pay bill s and take care of my other responsibilities  long gone are the days of ripping and running  arrests and Institutions are no longer in the picture nor is a real habit  it's how I manage Welcome back   We all regret drinking at some time or other but I have not heard one person say they regret getting sober   Though to be fair I have heard many wish they could drink moderately but for most of us it is an all or nothing deal and I would take sober EVERY SINGLE TIME  Enjoying waking up sober and refreshed is always nice  I wish you all the success in making 2017 your sober year  I'm British and moved to America four years ago  I had no idea that shots here were considerably bigger  No complaints  Happy One Year my friend   The intense malaise  andehonia  depression anxiety adrenal like fatigue  lack of mativation all seem to be from the ssri and snri aspects of kratom withdrawals  This is all just my thoughts and small amount of research though   Thanks  Happy new year   If I hadn't found this sub I'd be in denial and still be drinking so it's great to be here  Checking in They're the devil  straight up  I'm starting to believe that no one short of dying or passing out from agony should be given opiates     It was a hard learned lesson for me  but you really can't take care of anyone if you don't take care of yourself  It helps to remember that someday  children will be adults with a lot more accurate hind sight  Things that seem tragic now  could very well be understood later  Good luck  man    Man   that is such a refreshing take on the subject  I went to my first rehab when I was 16  43 now and man has my perspective changed  I've been on again off again over my life  I know that I am fully in control of myself and my life  I make the decisions  I stay away from substance s that require assistance to come off of  opiate s and alcohol   How are your cravings now  I can really empathise with this   The last time I stopped I had it every day from my work colleagues  I've left there now as the atmosphere was toxic  People would actually rip it out of me every day because I'd not got smashed all weekend  Typically  we don't give advice here because stopping drinking is really a personal path  I can share what worked for me though      one day at a time   you don't drink for one day only  Some will write in the daily check in you can find on this sub  I did it through planning    planning   who will I meet  Where will I go  Who could ask me to go out for a drink  How will I refuse  Those questions covered 90  of the situations    sober people  sober places   I didn't meet with people who drank  I didn't go in bars  The idea is to get alcohol as far away from you    read and write on this sub often   at first  I came here multiple times a day to read and write  I generally wrote one post a day but commented on other threads like a mad man   As you can see  there is no awesome genius trick to stop  I just made sobriety my main focus over anything everyone else  I didn't care about my family or my SO  all I did was getting sober  Then  family life got better because I wasn't a fucking drunk  This is a battle in your head  You're brain is used to you feeding yourself while high  You just gotta mentally work yourself to eat  If you can get yourself to eat breakfast without being high  lunch should be a little easier  and dinner will be easier than that  This is my experience at least   You just gotta work your way into it slowly maybe and the more often you eat  the easier it should become   It definitely doesn't help  that's for sure   Yeah expanding my kitchen activities are very high on my list of to do's Look at you two   Couple of old timers  Its the inner fighting between rational brain that nows porn is bad and old brain that says "Watch all of those nude women you hear " Congrats  Let's not drink together  "Going smoke free for a year "  You'll be smoking in a few days  if you last that long  Either you quit or you don't  This addiction is so powerful   Hell yeah start the year on the right foot   Instead of being a guy who plays video games  now you're gonna be just a guy who's in school and hits the gym   The motivation will wear off but discipline will see you through   Do it to it  My 1 year chip from Ninjilla was a wonderful thing to open this morning   I told my son and his girlfriend at breakfast that I'd gotten it and they both High  Fived me  Great start to the New Year  Lol    http   i imgur com ZY2V0AF jpg   You kids couldn't find your ass with both hands  and you don't know shit about drugs    Lighting up my inbox with your silly posts doesn't change that   Post a motherfucking source for your claims    Something legitimate     I'm almost positive these symptoms are not completely related to kratom use  Firstly  you've only used for 4 months and at relatively low doses  Unless you're having some sort of allergic reaction  this is quite odd and unsettling  I'm sorry you're going through this  I'm used for over 2 years  mostly at least 30 40g daily  I've gone cold turkey from that amount and this time I'm tapering  Both ways  I've never had a reaction as bad as yours  To be honest  I think you should see a doctor  Also  try to focus on your diet  exercise and meditation  I would try to avoid other meds and supplements for now just to be safe  Stay strong buddy  I would maintain on your dosages for a few days  unless things get worst when you take kratom  then I would just quit cold turkey since you're already at such a low dose  Take care man Yeah  I've been out for four days  and it's so noticeable  Very strange  In almost every one of my previous quits where I've made it more than 4 or 5 days  I always got to the point where things were looking up  maybe a pound or more was shed  I felt better  etc   and I started missing whatever the hell I thought I was missing out on  Maybe I missed numbing myself  missed being goofy during that first drink or two  missed not having to deal with reality for a few hours every night  In other words  I forgot that I actually hated numbing myself  doing or saying stupid crap after the first couple drinks  and wasting my life by avoiding reality    I haven't counted the number of reasons I have for not drinking  There are lots  And despite seeing the benefits already  I'm sure I've lost a couple of pounds  I don't wake up with hangovers  I waste less time  the reasons I don't drink today are the same  For example  I gained weight around my midsection because of drinking  That's already looking better  but I know that if I start drinking again  I'll lose that progress  That reason doesn't just go away  nor do the more important reasons   And if anyone treats me worse because I don't drink  that's not a person I want in my life   OMG people are real twats  If someone asked me if I had shingles I'd probably say "No  it's          " and make up a word  Then say "Oh it's catching by the way  you shouldn't be so close"  UGH Going through a break up  Split up on Christmas Eve  I moved from Chicago to Maryland to be with him  I'm in the suburbs and don't drive  so am really isolated  He went back to his family in Ohio for a few days  I am drinking myself into total oblivion  Whiskey  my dog and horror film binge  That's nice that you had a nice night   Thank you for engaging the sub   It's one thing to walk in to a subreddit with daily activity  it's another to see it has active moderators who are passionate about the success of its members     Let's do 2017   Happy new year everyone  I will not drink today  So awesome        Be proud   Awesome resource  VE  Thanks and Happy New Year  Personally  I don't have qualms with a moderate amount of coffee  Just with the pile of garbage I feel like after energy drinks  I invested in a nice 1400w blender a while ago and yes  start with some spinach and kale  then add whatever fruits you like  use some frozen  too as heat can kill some of those nutrients  and it is definitely a great  natural  and guilt free energy boost  Well there's no way to know you're an alcoholic if you've never drank  I don't say that to encourage you to drink  but just to say that you're in a position that I often envy  I sometimes wonder how much better off I'd be right now if I had stayed away from alcohol altogether  However  if both your parents are alcoholic  there's a strong chance you will be too   if you start drinking   There's definitely a hereditary factor in alcoholism addiction   On top of all that  you're never going to truly escape your feelings by drinking  Alcohol will only provide a temporary and illusory respite from your feelings  If anything  once it wears off  your feelings will come back even stronger than before  That's how it was for me  I don't recall ever waking up from a night of drinking and thinking "Wow  I'm glad I got drunk last night  that was totally worth it " It was never worth it the next day  it only seemed to be good in the moment while I was drunk   You'll be better off facing the feelings you're having and trying to work through them  That's a whole other topic of discussion though  I hope that helps  and if you want to talk about whatever is bugging you to drink  I'm all ears  I fell out of favour with the ideas and beliefs that were behind the AA program  I also felt like it was very cliquey  I tried to go to different meetings and got involved in service  but it stopped feeling right   I was also confused  I was told that if I stopped going to AA meetings  I'd relapse  That sounded irrational to me  Like  why would I need to continue to go to meetings for the rest of my life  Could I find something else that worked for me  that kept me aware of my problem  but didn't require me to somehow KEEP identifying as an alcoholic day after day   I was also realizing that people on SD had never gone to AA and had stayed sober  Then I started to learn and read about substance abuse  and the theories behind it   and I realized there was more to do than a simple disease model   So  it was a lot of things that accumulated over time   Now I work in the substance abuse field  I volunteer with substance abuse organizations  I got training in peer support  and use SD as my support  I am happy and feel more well rounded than I did when I was in AA  Day 3 here  It gets easier  Me too  Also  I like your username   Early January 1  sounds like it counts to me  Total agree  His books were part of what helped me quit both those things  where are you at with your readiness to work on it   If you are ready  there are lots of places to start   If you are not ready  you gotta work on that first   You can lose the weight  or just stop gaining  it's just about controlling your calories   You have to find another way to deal with your stress  other than food  then you can do it   I'm doing weight watchers and having a lot of success   Let me know if I can help  Admitting to other people I wasn't drinking during my first week or two made it a lot easier   I just said "I am not drinking because 99  of the time it isn't a problem  but that 1  isn't worth it" to people who pushed it  Dude   whenever u get that 'just once' itch  please hop on here and let us remind u of what u don't want  Let those of us sitting on massive Kratom habits remind u of all the BS you are now free from  Good job with your quit   I wanna be just like u someday   Cant argue with an idiot   Goal number one  hit a year sober this march  Goal two  get my license back in April  Goal three  pay off my court fines before April  Goal four  have fun  Do cool stuff  Go to more concerts  Stay with Chris  and make him and me happy  Save money  Some other shit  Mostly I just want to be happy and I am so I'm just gonna keep doing that   I liked everything about that story except for the busted bong  I broke my pipe yesterday so it's back to the bong for me  unless I get energetic and grab some skins from the store   Those fireworks sound magical  I'm honestly scared shitless about a career change  and that path literally has no room for games   But I say bring it   Games are a waste of time   Excited to work toward something I can call a profession  Hey we just came back from a walk as well  What a beautiful way to start a new year eh  I'm thinking of you  I'm certain this whole sub community is thinking about you   55 000 people thinking of YOU  Happy New Year my friend   I like the way you think  I will do my best to   make   2017 a good year  Days 1 4 were fucking hell  I will not drink today  I have missed a few days due to the flu  I am still not well  but I am here and sober  Happy New Year to all my SD family   Thank you for your post  One day at a time sounds ridiculous when you start  On the one hand  one day at a time is  hard   but on the other  you know it needs to be long term  But after a few days  it makes sense    Forget about tomorrow  and yesterday has happened  Just focus on now  and it all seems much more achievable  Shit yes you will This is another giant red flag with kratom  It is completely unregulated  It could be sprayed with anything in the growing process or contaminated somewhere along the way  we have no way of knowing   My Xvendor claimed they "tested routinely for purity"  but then an independent tester claims to have found desomorphine in the very product I was taking   Scary stuff    Thirty hours with no sleep  Are you on other drugs    Bodies are incredibly capable of repairing themselves  get clean by any means possible  I would expect the best if I were you  Your sister sounds like an asshole   Good job   Stay strong  Still here still sober     I'll probably spend every second when I'm realised here haha  1  I'd like to have a family one day  but I would be no good as a dad as a drunk   2  I exercise enough that I should be trim and handsome  but instead I've got fat   3  Sleeping through the night rules   4  A variety of health things  including a family history of diabetes  and recurrent acid reflux from the alcohol and the Advil I use to treat hangovers   5  I have severe depression  Booze feels like a fix but actually makes it worse   6  I have to start acting like an adult about my career   7  I've got to the point where I don't do relationships because I feel guilty about inflicting my drinking habit on any potential partner  That blows  but it's going to remain true until I get this thing under control  Thanks for the link  Hoser in Chief  Cuddling with my littles has been better than anything I could describe today  Congrats on your year  Welcome back  Lol  I've been fighting a cold  I wake up with a pretty nasty sinus headache every morning    I'm woozy  I have no appetite  and it takes me an extra hour to really come to my senses   Of course it does  Of course while I'm trying to get sober do I get sick with what mimics a hangover every freaking morning   Oh well  still beats the alternative    and at least this way I get some sympathy from my spouse  Thank you  and thank you for your support this last year  Let's do this 2017  Awesome  Haha I almost tagged this with our Hoser flair  but didn't want to scare away the Canucks  Too low BAC causing GABA receptors to be over stimulated  I think  I think you come down in "layers" or at least that's how WD felt to me  On the rare occasion that I've gone cold turkey  I've felt awful by the ext morning  but it gradually got worse for about three days  There are a whackload of people celebrating one year today who joined us  Hell   u ninjilla is sending out one year coins to all these people as well    Welcome to SD  I hope you find what you need here  LOL I laughed so hard at that and had to tell my husband   it has my vote for SD quote of the day tomorrow      Thanks  that's a really great reply and I can identify with it all very well   I wish I could plus ten it  Me neither  But then I didn't reach out  either  We had a quiet night in and were in bed before midnight  I was up and at 'em early today   Hang in there  I know I had a pretty rough time emotionally for the first few weeks in this round of sobriety  It's better for me now   Congrats on 5  I'm sorry you are suffering the heartbreak of alcoholism in your family  I had an one alcoholic parent and can't imagine if both parents were abusing  No wonder your feelings are overwhelming    I'd get help from a therapist  Also  reading the book  Adult Children of Alcoholics  by Janet Woititz gave me insight about myself  Also  Alanon is a support group for friends and family of alcoholics  See  r Alanon  Meetings are almost everywhere  You can't change your parents  but you could learn how to cope with your own emotions with help from others   I'm in hospital for drinking for five days straight  nearly going into cardiac arrest and malnutrition  My mum still thinks I'm not an alcoholic or have a problem with alcohol     Every journey is different  but I find this place to be unique in that it really helps me to find people who have been through what I'm going through  that were in a relatable spot    in some ways it can be scary because you see the struggles people who have been sober for quite a while still have  and still amazing to see when people are feeling weak they can come here and get lifted up by virtual strangers who only want them to make it through the day sober  I felt a little weak at one point last night and jumped on this sub and it gave me renewed strength  its just an awesome place  This sounds awesome  Good luck  Sorry to hear you've had a tough time of it  Most CAs lurk between highs and very lows   it's certainly not a glamourous lifestyle  But it is what it is  the key is being able to slow down when you need too    Planning withdrawals is absolutely essential  get that figured out then it's much easier  On my calendar I have marked out when I taper  and when I stop for  sometimes for many weeks   Received an unexpected bonus so don't need to work for a little while  there's two ways it could go        Thank fuck for my calendar     Yessir   Weird   The other night I dreamed of rolling a joint so big and fat that it looked like a potato   Weird   Didn't smoke it   just rolled it    Congratulations  keep it up  you're a hero to many of us  Thank YOU  And I teetered about posting this for anonymity sake    but I feel this change has been such a gift  It feels bigger than me sometimes and I wanted to share to give encouragement  The physical transformation is what you can  see  and that in itself is huge  The spiritual metamorphosis is nothing but miraculous  to me   Something in me   bigger than me  changed one year ago  My wish is to get to a place where I can offer a hand  and help others where I once was  It's lonely and scary and I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy  Blessings to you 2017  My dad got sober when I was a senior in high school  Your mother sounds enmeshed in alcoholism  Get help for yourself by going to Alanon meetings  It's a support group for friends and family of alcoholics  See  r Alanon  You can't help Mom but you can take better care of yourself   family health money clarity goals relationships self respect Thanks  Seriously  I stumbled on this subreddit and I'm seeing a lot of internalized self loathing   Moderation is key to maturity  total abstinence is a crutch of those who lack self control  Congratulations and well done   I haven't drank since the evening of November 8th   It was at that moment that I realized that the condition that was helping give me an excuse to drink would still be true in the morning   I read "This Naked Mind" and started stopping   I'll not drink with you and the other fine people here today  I was going to die  I wanted to die  That scared me   Great work  especially during a tough time of year    I won't drink with you today   Nice work  I know I have had times where I wanted to stay sober more than doing or drinking something with the crowd  It has been the right call in the end  At first  I panicked when I thought of 6 months  I thought I never could do it  and it was true  I couldn't get 6 months sober while panicking about it  That's how "one day at a time" helped me  http   addictionblog org author scott   You might want to check out my blog willpower      highly overrated   strategies      definitely the difference for me  Great job stopping  Don't give up on making friends  man  You just need something you're interested in that other people are also interested in  Do you have any hobbies  Programming  Join a computer science class club at school  Reading  Join a book club  Just look for things to occupy yourself with that other people are involved in  Next time you do a group project make an effort to be friendly to the other people in your group  say that joke you thought of  It's really not that difficult to make friends once you start approaching people and getting some social skills     Living in a rural area is tough but it doesn't mean you're doomed to having a boring life until you move  Get a bike  go hiking  cut a trail in the woods and build a smoke spot  or literally anything else if you plan on completely quitting   Get a job if that's an option  You'll have income  something to do and an opportunity to develop social skills and make friends  You are a Sad little man   Have you ever heard of the blocking feature  The best  Awesome  Congrats  How long after you quit drinking did you start focusing on weight  if at all   Oddly  I was pretty good at sticking to my diet when I was drinking but since quitting I've been terrible at it  the season of carbs doesn't help in the least  How do you know you can stop after 1 or 2  That's me three months ago  You can get over this shit  I promise   And yeah  BSO in my best friend right now  Life is so much better not chasing kratom for something it's never ever gonna give you anyway  It's like some kind of abusive lover  Here's to a year  one day at a time   Congrats  This is fantastic  You have really turned things around and now you have a family  You are living the American Dream   But be careful  I'm catching up to you  I'm only 900 laps behind lol Go ask this question on the sub  like i said  Heroin is water soluble  This is ridiculous  You clearly wont listen to us so ask the rest of r opiates   Well  are you still dosing  Since you've only using a month  you're probably on a short runway to normal  Yes  yes we are     I've generally been feeling lost after walking away from a tech job I hated after working in tech solely after graduation and knowing it wasn't for me  And the last several months have been not knowing what to do with my life  Right now I'm just telling myself I can't have anything without sobriety first  so that's where my focus will lay    Man  a case in the fridge and a bottle in the pantry would be hell for me  Gj  Great job man  Losing weight sure is a lot more of a pain than putting it on  huh  Keep it up though  you are gonna be even happier when you make a post like this again next year I know I need to stop slow down  I've been getting the shakes the last few weeks  and that's a new thing  Things are tough right now  Not even sure how to go about stopping  I've no support system and live in the sticks  My Mum is an alcoholic  so this life isn't unfamiliar to me  but this reality is hard  Whiskey is a lot cheaper than therapy  Checking in  all the best everyone  I have been sober for only a few months but it has been the easiest for me to quit this time for one main reason  I realized alcohol was not doing anything for me  I think people are always better off without drinking as there is really no benefit to drinking that you can not get through cheaper means  Not only is it an expensive habit but it wreaks havoc on your body by disrupting your neurochemistry and endocrine systems  Aside from the reduction in serotonin  which actually makes depression worse  and the lowered testosterone levels  it can also increase estrogen levels and make you look less masculine  It damages the liver  causes cell death in your nervous system  and ultimaly it never addresses your original problem  I got a DUI when I decided to get drunk due to some girl trouble I was having  Drinking did not fix our problem  I just woke up hungover with a new problem    I really do not think you will confer any meaningful benefit from drinking  You are always better able to resolve your problems with a clear mind than you are while intoxicated  This is not even addressing the fact that you  like myself  appear to have a predisposition to alcoholism   This is my problem  I say Beetlejuice ONE time and that Voodoo looking skull guy shows up  sprinkles some powder on my face and suddenly I'm 5 drinks in with a tiny head  and I don't remember going to bed or how I got there  Thank you    Thanks   It's great   They know their alphabet  saying   recognizing upper   lower case letters     they can both count to 30   Other than being bright little boys  they couldn't be more different   One is very openly affectionate and loves anything with wheels  monster trucks are his favorite  and the other one is more serious  loves to read and is the boss of the house       I also have an awesome teen son who is almost 16    the three of them   my wondetful husband are absolutely the light of my life    To get rid of blueballs  urges  to feel good  because it's normal  healthy  etc    Masturbation isn't the culprit my friend  Porn is the culprit  Porn is the problem   Bloody hell   I felt sorry for myself due to the odd friend or colleague making a comment   I'd sot him down and explain you are serious and why etc and how he made you feel   He won't be taking it seriously hence the comments   If he was serious then you'll be having much more serious conversations  For the next couple of weeks   r cripplingalcoholism is

Please  contact the moderators of this subreddit   message compose  to  r cripplingalcoholism  if you have any questions or concerns   I used to set myself targets of 365 days  six months  three months  whatever  I did that for years and years   For me  a year is too big to comprehend  I honestly can't tell you if I will be sober on the 31st December 2017  I can tell you I'm sober today and I will make it to bed tonight without drinking  Tomorrow will take care of itself   The thing that you will hear most of all around here is "one day at a time" and the reason for that is because it's pretty much all we can do  Good job man   That's wonderful   I'm certainly proud of you   Let's not drink together today  Happiness clarity health family freedom progress pancakes This is encouraging  thank you  I wish I had more mamas like you around  I'm the only alcoholic in my group of girlfriends  There used to be quite a few more  but when I quit drinking I lost a lot of friends  My girlfriends now have my back and support me fully  however they don't really know what it is I'm going through so there's not a lot of empathy  I don't talk about my alcoholism a lot with them  because it's not relatable  I suppose this is what a good therapist or a good home group is for  Something I plan to work on in 2017 Look into phenibut  that always helped me a ton when needing to get sober for a while Apparently we're stopping smoking     I hate those 3 4 days   My new years resolution is to make it to a full year  God willing I'll have that in March  My other resolution is to get through my steps   I also want to be the best possible framer  parent  significant other  son  and brother I can be  I will work my hardest to fulfill those  If people were hones about it less people would be in this situation  I feel myself getting physically addicted within two weeks of taking it  It fucks up my sleeping schedule and makes me a night owl   It feels so good  and it gets even better  I promise   Willpower and hope are fabulous if you have them  but if you happen to feel in low reserve of either  please come check in for support    Great decision  Stick with it  You are awesome   Excellent work   And yeah  I don't miss being the most drunk person doing the dumbest thing either     Let's not drink together today  Day one going strong Triple digits messed me up because then I staryed thinking of how far away 4 digits seemed and by day 105 I was drinking again  experience been so far   Worth it   it is like finding a real root problem instead of treating the underlying symptoms   I had no idea there could be side effects to using it at the time and things didn't magically get better either   I feel like the adult self of my kid self  I used to have a lot of confidence and energy when I was a kid  I used to be a different person but porn changed me a lot by taking way too much energy from me   I don't hate porn  I give it its respect  it is too powerful and I can live without it  Day three I think  Honestly this withdrawal is really light  Considering getting more before the end of the break though  Just bored as hell   Good point   Lots of times I think we blame weed for everything  when in reality its the overall lifestyle that encourages smoking that we should be working on as well   Ask yourself what you think your new life would be without smoking  and start it now regardless of whether you're still smoking   Positive things will hopefully crowd out the smoking  I'm thinking of you too  I really admire that you're staying strong and sober despite your mood right now  Keep strong  You've taken a huge step to improving your life  I'm not drinking with you today   I wake up on the floor near my small computer desk  and start drinking again and the next thing I know   a week has gone by   No more  Did they just assume you were because you were in a jovial mood  and because they probably couldn't tell the difference  being drunk themselves    Funny     Good work not being tempted   Tell us how you did it  It's not as bad as methadone  but the time frame is similar because they have long half lives   You can expect to feel pretty shitty for possibly up to 3 weeks or so   It won't start bad until about 72 hours after the last dose  Day 5 10 will be the worst usually diminishing from there   Your legs and possibly arms and shoulders will twitch badly and you'll feel a lot of aches and pains  sweating  nausea   Loperimide can help minimally  Immodium   Good luck  hang in there  Keep it up  r petioles Did you do it   Do it  Psst   those 50 or so days were not a loss  we get to do what we want with our badges  and you're the one you have to be accountable to  You clearly learned a lot during that sober time   I'm glad you are able to rise and enjoy the first day of the new year without any ill effect from alcohol   Here's to a beautiful year in recovery   Opiates absolutely diminish libido and once you're to the point of shooting opana  that IS your sex life  The sidebar tapering guide is really good  Apply water to the shitty beer  you'll be fine in 3 4 days  drink water on top  and above anything eat everything in sight  I wish you and your mother well   happy to help assist whenever needed  Checking in  It's raining outside and I'm home alone  but staying strong  Happy New Year everyone   Vaping is about 95  safer than smoking  It's also worth mentioned that cigarettes have about 750x the amount of diacetyl in them than vape juice  There are also many juice companies that don't use diacetyl at  In fact  it's rare to find someone who does use it      There isn't a single documented case of popcorn lung caused by vaping      Sure  fresh air is what should be in your lungs  but compared to smoking a cigarette  vaping is way safer and you won't smell like shit    Not only that  with vaping  you can control how much nicotine you ingest which makes it the easiest cessation method to ween off nicotine    I was a near pack a day smoker for 10 years  Thanks to vaping  I and both smoke and vape free for many months now            This is good advice   It feels so good to be the responsible one  doesn't it   Excellent share  and good job on continuing your sobriety into the new year  Not going to drink with anyone today   Day one      Ohhhhh fuck      Thx  any additional advices  I thought about transfering from gaming PC to a laptop    some say it helps  some say not  The laptop would have a weak components if I would buy it  If you still think you're missing something you'll probably go back eventually  The trick is realizing you're not  Drinking doesn't work  I don't mean that in a judgemental way  It's just how alcohol works in my experience  It convinces you that you need it to enjoy life until you realize you don't   I for one definitely want to quit forever  I don't need weed to relax  Actually  as a matter of fact  weed doesn't even relax me  It makes me tense as all fuck  I second  u SOmuch2learn's advice  I also know firsthand how difficult that situation is   My marriage did not make it either  there were other issues  to be sure   but the most important thing for me to have success in my sobriety was to focus on taking care of myself  whatever that looked like     Check in to let us know how you're doing  won't you   This group is such a great resource  Such a wealth of information in that link  thank you  This compliments my self crafted program of sobriety and personal growth  I found that I am responsible for my choices and those reflect upon me  the person I want to be and the path I follow  SD never fails to amaze  It's all here  It's a worse idea to use mega doses of Imodium  There's a growing number of cases where people experience permanent heart disorders from Imodium   Its still part of the immersion  I remember spending hours and hours watching MMO Starcraft videos  Don't take it personally  What's the 30 day book  Science always seems to be a common theme with addicts lol  I've met people who know intimately about the chemicals they use and the science behind it that becomes an obsession and a love in itself I guess this idea of using what scientific evidence they can find to justify their choices also exists in recovery    I never said there was anything wrong in getting help for our addictions and we find what works but all I ever seem to read is somebody who swears by kratom but can never stop using it or somebody who swears by 12step recovery but has never finished the steps and never stopped going to meetings  If you use another drug to feel better or use colored keychains it's all the same a little rush to keep you going another day    People can do what they want I just dream of a day where I don't need anything else but myself to survive  Where I don't depend on something to make me feel good  I wasn't even bashing it but you say anything negative about 12step and people all come out the woodwork like a rabid pack and attack from all sides but as soon as somebody comes for help you put on the nice face again and tell them to get to meetings because it's the only cure except it's not   Tell those people you know to contact the CDC or at least see a doctor  because they would literally be the first documented cases of popcorn lung caused by vaping  I also would like to note that cigarettes have 750x the amount of diacetyl in them than vape juice if it's even a vape juice that has diacetyl  They are rare    Strong work right here  Oh  you   At least gorging on the sausage and hash browns won't leave you in any embarrassing situations   unless you go into a food coma and take a nap at the table     I like to hope if I make it 10 years  off dope that I manage to make a life for myself and don't spend my spare time still sitting in a room talking about my first world problems   AA will probably be preferable to NA   The principles can be applied to any substance   NA is a bit more rigid in that they consider the use of any substance  sometimes even prescribed meds  a relapse and the fact that you will never be considered "sober" there if you smoke  can be frustrating  Lovely  I took a nice walk this afternoon myself  it was raining in the morning   The sheer pleasure of being outside and able to enjoy life clear headed makes the whole thing worthwhile all by itself  Keep up the good work  I'm with you  Let's take 2017 by the balls  Strong work on one year  Congratulations  One day at a time  My reasons evolved over time    I found doing a cost benefit analysis a particularly useful tool to get them out on paper   Initially some of the things that tipped the scales to motivate me to stop drinking were     My health was suffering  hangovers  sweats  amongst others  and I feared for the unseen damage and risks to my health   I recognised that I had a lot of rationalisations for drinking  and that ultimately they were hollow excuses and lies   My life was revolved around alcohol in an unhealthy way  and it wasn t getting any better   my addiction was deepening over time  Once I got sober  I then strated to value the benefits of my not drinking   these include     Being present in my own life   Being present with my loved ones   Putting my priorities first   Better self care   I am happier   I have better discipline to work out   I am healthier  In addition to all that  I'm doing better financially  in my career  and even completed my degree  I am a better version of me when alcohol isn't in my driving seat  I am free   I had the exact same experience  Honestly  I had much more fun being sober than being super drunk like I would be prone to get  I was able to stay up late and hang out with everyone  Glad you had a great time  Happy New Year to you  so itchy right now   whine    I was soooo petrified before my first meeting   I didn't find  r stopdrinking until a couple of weeks into my recovery  so I didn't really have anyone to share my feelings with   I'm glad that you're able to post about it before going   and look forward to your return to tell us all about it   It will be great  I'm sure   I've got 200 hours in Overwatch  maybe 100 150 in Fallout 4  The first 100 hours of Overwatch were a blast  but I am no longer having fun  I am only still playing to climb up the ladder   I have had great experiences on both games  but I'd rather get more into my tech hobbies  The time I spend in my tech hobbies will make me happy now  and will continue to entertain me for years to come  The time I spend on Overwatch only matters now  and will cease to matter when the next epic game is released  Because most people here don't have the ability to use it in moderation  30mg isn't that high  I've heard plenty of reports going above 100mg  I don't think I have to worry about that especially for short term use Happy New Year everyone  The first thing I want to say is this  There will be things that will happen this year to all of us that will be out of our control  but the rest is up to us  Just like the serenity prayer  accept the things you cannot change but have courage to change the things you can   I had such a memorable NYE with friends from New England  It was the first time I actually trekked the city of Philadelphia since I was in active addiction  It has been years  Luckily all the good stuff for sober people is in the nice sections lol  We hit up touristy spots for fun  saw the early bird fireworks at 6  ate in China Town  visited my friend's cousin  and took the train back to go to my friend's aunt's to watch the ball drop  We did go to bars and I have been DDing a lot more lately and found that I am pretty smooth with my red bulls lol  I honestly hate what alcohol does to my stomach the day after and have no desire to get drunk anymore  This Winter break has been so memorable and I'm so glad to be back on my feet socially after basically isolating save for a few people since 2013  Seriously the best Winter break yet  I am over the moon with how happy I've been  On top of being a heroin addict I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder in 2013 and have really come so far  I've conquered it with meds and therapy  have avoided the hospital  and have worked and gone to school  which the doctors at the psych ward suggested I may never be able to do  FUCK YES    2016 was a great year for me  It was the best year I've had in a very long time  I am hoping 2017 will be even better  I don't have to start the new year with "I hope this year won't be as bad as the last " I start it with  "I hope this year will be even better " I have so many goals  too much to share  but I am very excited to start school again  I have 3 weeks till the semester starts and I plan to make the most of it     TL DR     Life is good  Serenity now  Give recovery some time   effort and it'll pay off   Well done  I hope I'm where you are in a year's time   We are animals  Thank you for your response  I appreciate you taking your time to give your thoughts  I am not involved in AA presently    there is really no benefit to drinking that you can not get through cheaper means  Could you tell me a few examples please  Appreciate the message  Happy New Year  I don't comment on your posts much but I want to say I read them every day and I enjoy them  You are on the right track and will definitely hit and year   then some  Happy new year  Thanks for the replies  To clarify some things that I rushed past in the initial post  I'm a pretty smart guy  not to brag  but to give some context  and yeah  these symptoms are very strange and I can tell that the majority of this is from the kratom  but I'm a bit concerned  like I mentioned  that I've hit a threshold and metaphorically "broke" something that may or may not be naturally repairable or I just have some hormones way out of whack  I smoke some cannabis  buds and concentrate  this isn't the problem though  throughout the day to help with things  but it hasn't been helping much with these problems  I'm okay off and on  but experiencing slight withdrawals also  since I've really dropped my dose down over the last day and half or so  I've had 2gs today about 12 hours after last dose   4g   after about 7 8 hours pretty good sleep  which has been rare until the past couple days  when I've slept way more and way more peacefully than I really ever have   The 30 hours awake was forced since I had a lot of stuff I was doing that day  lazy things  but things   I wanted to flip my day night sleeping hours around  and I just didn't want to sleep yet  The kratom I've been taking is Club13  I will mention  this is some of the best stuff I've had  it's strong and doses are probably comparable to higher doses of some other brands   and has been pretty good to me through many bags  including this one  until just the other day  I think I may have just overloaded some areas and am experiencing some crazy emotional distress and hormone imbalances and at this point  I'm thinking that I'm "probably" okay  but I'm just taking it easy for a few days here and really tapering way down  It really all got bad after that 30 hour day where I had 16 20gs throughout and then slept for about 12 hours  tossing  turning  awake a lot  nightssweats  hotflashes  classic withdrawal stuff  so didn't actually sleep much  and then got up the next day and within about 15 minutes  ended up so angry and in a rage for about an hour until I forced myself to dose because I knew my mood was just crazy from withdrawal after the crazy day before  I was mostly fine for a while  but then got very abnormally tired  which basically continued until I went to sleep for around another 12 hours  Then I got up  was very angry and irritable again but not raging  dosed  awake for around 6 hours  then slept for another 12 or so  Then I was up for around 12 hours  2 doses in there somewhere   then slept for around 8 hours again  Then I got up  went out and when I had my dose this time  this is when things got really ugly for my emotions and I had the weird "attack"  I got really tired after that also  This "tired" also comes with some weird leg feelings  kind of weakness  and my right arm gets weak  so those are very weird and slightly concerning symptoms  Then I came back home and slept for about 7 8 hours  That was last night  and I've had one 2g dose since then  about 12 hours later   I've been mostly okay  just experiencing normal withdrawals today  I will continue to report progress for anyone interested  Happy New Year Bone        I was also "high functioning" for many  many years  had a home  good job  family  no legal trouble  etc   but I was utterly miserable   And toward the end I could feel myself slipping lower and lower   I'm glad you're able to face reality before it gets any worse     Checking in here daily was a huge support in my early sobriety  hope to see you around  Yessss   I love this   Congrats on your 49 days    Its tough to make it through the New Year and all   Meetings are good  but sometimes they suck   If you find yourself in one of the later ones just go to another one   Other than that tidbit there is nothing quite like being in the atmosphere of recovery   It's saved my life more times then I can count   best of luck  Thank you  I appreciate that     How crazy is that  Upside down world indeed  I will not drink today   What better way to start the new year   Lost Prophets   4am Forever  https   youtu be baiPs 904As    Just a disclaimer that I'm aware that the singer of this band is in prison for being a pedophile before anybody comments  It's still a great song and the lyrics get me   Lyrics   Yesterday I lost my closest friend Yesterday I wanted time to end I wonder if my heart will ever mend I just let you slip away  4 AM forever  Maybe I'll never see you smile again Maybe you thought that it was all pretend  All these words that I could never say I just let them slip away  4 AM forever  Why don't you hear me when I'm calling out to you  to you  Why don't you listen when I try to make it through  to you  Goodbye  goodbye Goodbye  you never know Hold a little tighter  4 AM forever  Maybe one day when I can move along Maybe someday when you can hear this song You won't let it slip away  4 AM forever  And I'd wish the sun would never come It's 4 AM and you are gone I hope you know you're letting go It's 4 AM and I'm alone  Why don't you hear me when I'm calling out to you  to you  Why don't you listen when I try to make it through  to you  Goodbye  goodbye Goodbye  you never know Hold a little tighter  Why don't you hear me when I'm calling out to you  to you  Why don't you listen when I try to make it through  to you  Goodbye  goodbye Goodbye  you never know Hold a little tighter  4 AM forever    I've had anxiety off and on for as long as I can remember  But being on zero substances as of about a month ago has made it barely noticeable  And what's really strange is how I can differentiate  body anxiety from emotional anxiety  I'm fully convinced drugs of all kinds create anxiety generated by the body  At least now that I'm straight  I'm still weird lol   I used alcohol to deal with social anxieties  Instead  I take ashwagandha daily to reduce stress and help with anxiety  It is clinically proven to reduce cortisol levels    If you're feeling down in the dumps exercise is one of the quickest and easiest ways to improve your mood almost immediately  and it costs nothing   Sign me up please  This time I'll get it right    TaxSlayer  Never thought about it in this context before but there's a lot of bad messages re  alcohol in our  GT  songs cheers lore   Our fight song  "Rambling Wreck" literally contains the lyrics   "Like all the jolly good fellows I drink my whiskey clear "  "I wish I had a barrel of rum" and "I'd drink to all good fellows who come from far and near "   It's also been a school tradition since 70s that the band plays the Budweiser song  "When you said Budweiser you said it all "  at the end of the 3rd quarter   There's also a cheer we do that ends with   "Fight   Win   Drink   Get naked   "  All that said no drinks at game  despite being in club level  or last night   Am at day six with what should be worst temptations of year behind me and passed all tests  Welcome  Good luck  Sign me up son  I'm kicking 2017's ass Congrats to all  Great inspiration for the rest of us  I'm not in Colorado  but even if you don't find an agnostic group  you may be pleasantly surprised to discover that not everyone in AA is religious  and that some people even talk about that without judgment at meetings   I'm an atheist  and I've attended meetings for over three years without being converted        A thought   meetings that advertise as LGBT friendly are often quite tolerant of religious diversity as well  even if they aren't labeled as such   I hope you find a meeting that works for you  Hey healthy sober twin   Late 2015 I kicked drugs but didn't work on my recovery  I didn't think alcohol was a drug and I was waiting for some magic to happen from abstaining from drugs  I didn't    End of January 2016 I found myself handcuffed after driving with a  205 BAC  It was the best thing that ever happened to me  2016 was a terrible year  I had no job  no license  and I was a mess  But it was also a good year  I got sober  lost 30 lbs and I'm in the best shape of my life   and I addressed my depression    2017 is looking good  I start a new job after being unemployed and unemployable for over a year  I'm clean and sober for 1 year soon  I have a great life and it will only get better so long as I stay sober  Congratulations  Haha  that's my new favorite stat   percent of year sober  Happy new year to you too  Don't waste your time Fash  Dude's always looking for a fight somewhere lately  Such a good feeling  isn't it   Happy New Sober Year to you     Noice  I'm struggling with my additctions  but I hope to join you soon   YAY    Happy new years back to you   3 Ooof  I've been there  I know how real the pain is  If there's a way to ease out of the relationship more permanently please try it  But believe me  I know it's not easy and it can get overwhelming and seemingly unending  And the lies  The lies are so maddening  The drinking and meanness is scary and saddening  And the lies are so maddening because we feel like they think we are fools  And sometimes we feel like fools  Anyway  I don't mean to speak for you  just know that there are people out there with stunning levels of empathy  Sending good vibes to you over the interwebs   Thanks  Yes  I have been thinking about trips  too  Why not  Carpe diem  Ha ha ha   That's the funniest thing i've seen all day  Thanks brother  Appreciate the suggestions  We will definitely get a new theme on the sub soon  Agree on the memes  The google hangout is a good idea   I don't think I have the capacity to organize it right now but maybe someone else can take the lead on that  Stayed up later than I should've but still managed to wake up early to catch some football with coffee  It's only 2pm I feel like I still have the whole day ahead of me  Nope  Still sober   I worked night shift at the hospital  and toasted the new year with my co workers using only sparkling grape juice  One of my friends insisted he saw me pouring wine into my glass   I'll post a reply here when I've written up my plan Congrats on your 3 years   Congrats on a sober orbit around the ol sun  Keep up the great living  I went from 12 to 6 to 3 to 1 5 to 0 to no vaping  It's hard though  You still have to want it and you need the willpower to fight through the cravings    I'm vape and smoke free for many months now and that's thanks to vaping   I'm 7 months sober and alcoholism runs in our family as well  My mom  when I quit  was HARDCORE trying to get me to continue drinking with her  To the point of begging me to go to the bar and just drink a little or she wasn't going to speak to me anymore  However   while she is not fully there  she attended her first AA meeting last week through all of her own effort  I never comment on her drinking because I know for me  it had to come from my own self awareness  So essentially  me quitting has allowed her the freedom to find her way as well   D Good job     We went skiing this morning  We arrived at the mountain at 8  Not many people there  It was a beautiful day that we were able to take full advantage of   Awesome job   I already posted because he wouldnt  And what do you know  Not ONE answer except what tim and i were telling him  Curiously he has not responded since i sent him the link   Make sure you plan how you'll do things differently when you go back    I did the same thing  Didn't smoke for 4 months while I was away  As soon as I was back I started again  Although I'm not 100  teetotal  I choose to never get drunk  Whilst I like dancing  I have never been to a nightclub and I'm now in my mid twenties  Very occasionally I like to drink a small glass of cider  or have a sip of wine or champaign during celebrations  I always prefer a soft drink   Mum said to me it is okay to drink alcohol in moderation  as this can help you relax  and alcohol consumption is on a fluid scale  Both my family and friends respect me when I choose not to drink   It is my decision to keep my mind clear  hydrated and in full control  The brain uses no more than 20  of your daily energy and I like to treat it as my best friend  The NHS also says regular drinking can cause higher risk of cancer  stroke and organ damage  most notably the brain  heart and lungs    Another reason I stay sober is because I like to set this example as being a good role model  particularly towards young people  Thanks for all your suggestions   will be implementing them  If you've never had a drink you are not an alcoholic   With two parents who are alcoholics you are more at risk of developing a substance abuse problem  but you don't currently have one   And you don't have to develop a drinking problem   Drinking is not a substitute for actually dealing with your feelings   Don't be afraid to have a drink every now and then  if you enjoy it and feel safe drinking   but don't turn to booze as a way to deal with your problems   It will only make things worse   Seek out the help of a therapist  psychologist  or counselor   I also encourage you to look into Al Anon meetings   It is a support group for family members of alcoholics and addicts   It could be really helpful to you   Here is a link to find an Al Anon group near you    http   al anon alateen org  Yay  I made it to 2017  I've got a good feeling about this year and I pledge to start it off on the right foot by not drinking today no matter what  AWSOME  KEEP IT UP   I'm really worried I'll have to get to this point to need to quit   There is a We Agnostics group you can Google Smart Recovery  as well  As a late 30s kind of guy I realize I can be a drunk or sober anywhere  but I do ponder how things might have unfolded differently had I not grown up   attended college here  rekt Fuck the zero  Never going back to that Yeah  I wasn't measuring anything  just abusing the hell outa Kratom  Heaping spoonfuls all day long  however much I wanted  I frequently did enough that I'd get sick  etc  Insanity and embarrassing  As well  I decided to taper and started at 30 g day  which I'm assuming was much less than I was taking  Have been feeling it for sure    Now I'm at 20 grams and I'm gonna stay here for a good while   probably ten days or until I've normalized  Then I'd like to drop a half gram every other day    more when it's easy and less if it's too much  When I tapered off Suboxone  it absolutely felt like it was in layers  I'd like to be off Kratom entirely on 4 1  This is not as easy and I expected it to be  Pretty pissed at myself for getting into this situation at all  but here I am anyway  What bugs me most is fairly constant leg pain  which is what I remember most from getting off Sub   I know it's not good to be judgmental  but your sister's question made me chuckle because I feel like people who drink because "everyone HAS to drink on New Year's" are the real losers   Just sayin         Keep up the good work  So true  I quit for months once and my life was exactly the same as it had been minus the weed  Me  Good for you    That's awesome   Keep it up  Slipped up over the holidays but I'm back and motivated  today I will not drink  merry chrismas ya filthy animal  D Congratulations  that's fantastic    And an organised garage   That's unheard of  I met with a doctor  He told me I had a shitty liver  I said to him it was probably because I drink so much coffee  2 months after that  I got sober  Fully up voted  I wish I knew this before starting kratom  or opioids in general  and when I was first trying to quit  I always threw in the towel at 2 weeks and just last month threw it in at 30 days  I'm approaching my new 30 day abstinence period and addressing the PAWS head on  I can only pray for significant improvements soon  I didn't experience them by day 30 last time  I used for 3 years plus 2 years of opiates before that  I'm starting a step class with my recovery group on Tuesday  Hopefully that will help  Denial  it's not just a river in Egypt   Denial is SO powerful  I was very sure that my problems had nothing to do with booze  Until I quit  Then the fog cleared and I saw exactly what was going on  thanks    I understand that booze may not be the best way to deal with feelings but I just don't know any better way Hey  thanks for sharing and getting that out  You are not alone in this  What helped me a lot when I was feeling hopeless was finding a counsellor I could speak to and get support from  I'd really encourage you to try and do the same  Here are a few resources that can potentially help   https   twloha com find help local resources   Find Help    Crisis Text Line  http   www crisistextline org     text HELLO to 741741  Hang in there  You're probably right  Just stay cautious and don't let loperamide replace your addiction  Good luck  You smoke like me  Here are the withdrawls I get     1st day I get EXCESSIVE sweating around my hands and feet  Like wearing a liquid glove  It is annoying  I am usually unable to sleep  Might I recommend some Benadryl if you must sleep  makes you feel groggy though        2nd day is the same as the first except that I find myself to be incredibly irritable for no particular reason  The slightest thing sets my belly fires going     This state persists in me for about 5 days and then slowly gets better as the weeks go on  I have only had intermittent sobriety and have been back to smoking heavy for a year now  Would like to quit soon but am just   well you know all the reasons we convince ourselves to not do something     I wish I could offer nicer words but the heavy smoking really amplifies the withdrawal effects   I can't believe I used to be a person that said there were ZERO withdrawal symptoms     Of course many of the uncomfortable physical feelings can be temporarily staved off by a cold shower and a shit ton of water  Meditating also helped a lot with the anger     I think it is really excellent that you are starting on this path  The thing is we don't know what we don't have until we get sober  You will definitely get more than 7 reasons after you are sober  Congratulations on 365 days   This internet stranger is proud of you  Cheers to you      We're in this together   Happy New Year  Happy 11 Months  and Congrats on the weight loss   I'm still following your lead     Woohoo   30 Day Sobriety Solution Wow  That thought has blown my mind    I agree  jusr Basic Alchonomics  what are they teaching in school these days    Wonderful thought    Nice Thank you  I'll take a look at it  Smoke free from this morning  me too  Better celebrate making it a day with a long  hard  drag       At least that's what you used to say  Stay on track man you can do it  Thank you for all of these amazing resources    Just like so many others  somehow this subreddit radically changed my thinking about quitting dribkig and provided me with support and stories to keep it that way  I sometimes feel sheepish saying that a subreddit did a better job than AA ever has  but it's working great   I feel like there is accountability here  and shared experience  It's made me stop drinking not only for my amazing spouse   who's given me more unconditional love  forgiveness and support than I feel like I deserve   but also for myself   I don't want to reset my badge  I don't want to go back to the anxiety  depression  the memory loss  the financial strain ever again  That's a common thread amongst so many posts  and they're very important reasons to rid our lives of alcohol   I also will not drink with any of you today  or the rest of this year  Try the al anon meetings   You should be able to find one in your area   You'll find lots of support there   If you are able  I also encourage you to seek out professional help   AA meetings got me started but therapy really helped me to deal with the anxiety that was the root of my drinking   Best of luck to you  Congrats on a YEAR   Happy New Year   Oh my  THANK you  And I love that you say you've only drunk once in 9 months  Such a great outlook on a slip  When I slip  have reset my badge twice now  I'm all "I'm a failure  and I'll probably never get this " This is such a great place to come for encouragement  It seems that most of did the exact same thing  I passes out in front of my family and they were unable to wake me except to take a drink and go back to sleep  I think my longest is about 80 days  That was a few years ago and it took pretty much all of my effort and willpower every day for that entire period to plan my entire life around not picking  It was incredibly strenuous but amazing to see I had it in me   Now  I have a few years of therapy under my belt and I'm handling my anxiety much better  I'm not pick free  but it's also not my main priority to be completely pick free anymore   I pick  very  little compared to what I used to due to a combination of being less anxious  handling it better when I am   understanding my triggers and finding ways to avoid or mitigate them  Yep I have   Another elusive sober Sconnie here  I spent NYE alone because I don't know any sober people  and I don't enjoy spending time with people who are drinking heavily anymore  Congratulations on 99 days sober  Needed that today  Thank you for sharing   Fear Of Missing Out   what if my friends have a great time without me  What if they have the best night ever  What if they meet and hang out with the most interesting person in the world  What if they have the best dance session in their lives   Fear Of Missing Out is ridiculous because we're usually not missing out on anything except for regrets  mistakes and hangovers  at least that's the way I used to drink    Happy New Years  Congrats on 2 years  Well done  I'm 6 days behind you and using patches too  fortunately free on the NHS   This is my third attempt in about 35 years  My worst fear is having a stroke and not being able to talk see move  But yeh  lung cancer's pretty bad too  Well  all the best and I'm sure you'll be a winner for your family and yourself  of course  Fantastic job  I'm grateful you're here     Congrats on a YEAR   Good luck  I was in the same boat  I'm now three weeks in and on the lowest dose patch   When I look at how many years I smoked for and how young I still am it scares me  More than half my life I've been a smoker  Learning how to be a non smoker has been the hardest part but so far it seems to be a much better lifestyle  I wish you the best and look forward to reading your 1 year smoke free post next New Years   Only your doctor can tell you what's really going on  I'm glad you have an appointment  Let us know what you find out  However  after abusing my body for years  it took more than a week to find any kind of equilibrium  Be cautious about self medicating with over the counter  so called  remedies  It's usually a waste of money  The healthiest thing you can do is eat well and don't put alcohol in your body   When I think about not drinking   I inevitably think that I'm doing it to avoid legal  health and relationship complications   Basically  my life is pretty good and there's 0  chance that alcohol is going to  add  to that  but there's certainly a chance that it's going to subtract from that goodness  I'm atheist and Aa is working for me    I'm from Auckland but live abroad at the moment   I hope you have a fantastic time  I've only done the Milford but it was absolutely epic  and when I come back home I want to do the others you listed   Let us know how it goes  So much this  The badge has been a huge reminder of my success in not drinking  and from others experience it seems to help a lot  I will most definitely not drink with you today  You got this   I've been on and off this forum a lot over the past 4 5 months  I made it 45 ish days  and have had a few relapses since  I'm going to spend a lot more time here and make 2017 the start of my new sober life  Thank you to all of the wonderful people here   Chapter one  the beginning to an awesome journey  Good luck  Cool  I'll try that next  Alanon meetings helped me find answers to difficult questions like yours  Meetings are almost everywhere    It's a painful decision to cut ties  but you have a right to peace of mind  Meetings helped me find it   Checking in  still on track   Thank you for that  Yeah  2 weeks isn't exactly correct for most of us  Now I want to say that for those who have had a short habit and moderately small doses  you will have an easier time than those who used for a prolonged period of time  The longer you use the longer it will take to heal  I am at day 31 after a massive habit for a long period of time  I feel great  better than I EVER did on Kratom  shocking  right   but I suspect this "healing process" is going to take a while  I have been at opiates for over 10 yrs  At this point  tbh  I feel better everyday  even better than the day before  You will get out of the quit what you put in  that simple  Good luck everyone  It's doable and you can CHOOSE to only do it once   Very good to know  thank you  I didn't have much luck with finding any AA meetings that were local enough today  but did find Phoenix Multisport  which I've heard great things about  Thanks again for your help  My roommate is trans and she's had similar situations with children pointing her out  I talked to her and she says the best way to manage it is to surround yourself with the people who recognize the positive in you  Also remember that the kid is young and doesn't know any better  You're beautiful with or without a healed face  Steeeerr clear  You don't wanna fuck with GABA        Edit  to elaborate  I really had and have a bad experience with GABA  If you don't currently take it  try not to make a habit of it  But everyone is different  maybe you'll be totally fine  I on the other hand  was not  The memory fucking still continues You have a right to live your life  You sound fine to me  It's nice to have friends who care  but there's a fine line between being concerned and controlling  Don't talk to your friends about it if you don't want their opinion   Exactly the same here  Seeing lots of people here on day 1 too is making me feel better and motivated   I think early sobriety is hard for everyone  I personally was an emotional roller coaster   My spouse drinks heavily and has his own problems with pot and alcohol  like attracts like after all  so it was hard for him a when I quit   especially because I've been trying to quit for years and have mostly failed   For the first while I said I was only quitting for 120 days becuase that's the amount of time I read it takes for your brain to start rewiring   this may not be true but it helped me    He has got used to me not drinking and likes that I am the designated driver   My friends still ask me if I'm not drinking every time we see them too they are taking longer then my husband to adjust  Good luck   Happy New year   January thread is up   https   www reddit com r StopGaming comments 5lhovg joyful january 2017 commit to not gaming this   Day 12  01 01  After being in a flatline since the start of this streak  urges hit me hard  but I have not relapsed  It's the same as always  with curiosities urging me to look for this thing or that thing because I've seen it only a few times before  The part that is the most abnormal about this  isn't the urge  but the fact that real attractive girls that I know personally  suddenly become uninteresting  almost non existent to me compared to the porn flashbacks my mind keeps tempting me with  I'm a woman and an atheist and still found value in AA  The Twin Cities has a multitude of recovery meetings  Generally they are not for any specific age group as you describe  Alcoholism crosses all age  race  gender barriers   I found getting rid of all the alcohol helped me to stick with it  My three or four failed attempts before I left stuff in the house and gave my silly brain justification to go back to drinking    I'm proud of you getting through news years    I had my first for a long time too    I completely disagree brother  It's not just the cardiac issue  Do your research man  I would never take both k and Imodium at the same time  It can very very addictive and it's a wayyyy nastier w d  If you are gonna go the Imodium route  just stop the Kratom and taper smaller doses for 3 days  days 2 3 4 of your CT  You are playing with fire  IMO  You are going to have to pay the piper  one way or another  I would rather do it just coming off kratom  not imodium  that shit can kill you  Be careful man  I will not drink today  I will not drink today     High Five for 365       1    edit  Accuracy is important where those precious 24 hours are concerned  Every day it gets a little better  I'm with you on this one  Btw what creative hobby was it you picked up  I am in a similar place but have not gotten to the point where I am ready to quit  My hope is that the medication will help ease some of the symptoms of my depression before i "leave"  Anything specific get you to making this decision   checking in Me too  I will not drink with you today    I just did  again your perspective is a breath of fresh air  I totally agree with your take on addiction  in my case I still smoke pot and dable in Meth about once a month  I'm not really sure if I am an addict  I've come to question this more recently as my use has limits and boundaries that as I've gotten older I've learned to respect  there have been times  many years  of using hardcore  been through methadone  Suboxone maintenance a few times  withdrawl enough times to realize that I cannot control any opiate opioid use or alcohol  So I abstain from them  Same for benzos  I have a family member who gives me a week at a time  which I usually store up for my monthly Meth binge for the comedown  I smoke pot a few times a week  no one knows this and I'm fine with that   I don't buy into "oh that's the addict talking" I'm not two different people  I'm just someone who has come to the conclusion that I will always use substance s and I will pay the consequences  I'm not hurting anyone and am content with what my life is  one thing that I have learned from my periods of "recovery" is acceptance  anyhow I feel like I'm rambling  it's good to know that there are people like you that are challenging the common misgivings that come with dealing with addiction  I don't know what you mean by "commitment"  AA isn't a club you join  nor is there a contract to sign  It's just a group of people who have a desire to stop drinking  You don't have to talk if you don't wish to share  I've often said  "Thanks  I'd rather listen"    I have no problem with the word "alcoholic" because I learned everything I could about it and know I have this chronic condition  I understand and accept it  Frankly  I am proud to be a recovering alcoholic  I'd much rather have that "identity" than to be labelled a "drunk"    Bravo for having the courage to go to a meeting and kudos for five days  I DID IT I get this feeling sometimes even with 14 months clean  But I force myself to go and always feel so much better after the meeting   It's good to have one less thing to feel guilty about    It's helped me to look at women differently  and to recognise how much commercial porn is pretty rapey and abusive    It's helped me realise that I can be a fantasist about lots of things  enjoying the idea of something but often not having the discipline or courage to make it a reality    It's also helped me realise I can manage very strong desires and emotions  and that I can choose what to do with them  rather than letting them affect me directly  I feel good about myself  that this is a decision I've made  and I've stuck to it  Yeah  I am coming to that belief  too   At least chronic daily drug use anyway   Our bodies  minds and souls just have a preference for     well  sunlight food and water and that's about it   just make sure your setbacks don't turn into excuses to have future setbacks  it's great that you can use this experience  but i know in the past i use to have setbacks all the time and then i'd just use that previous setback as an excuse in the future to hit my friend's joint or to buy a dimebag bc i'd think "it was only one time in the past  i can handle it now"  then you just fall back into addiction but i think you've got strong mind set just from reading your post  good luck with your progress   Congrats on a year  I hope to be where you are at this time next year  Such an accomplishment  I can't imagine all the different emotions you are feeling today  Good luck  Stay strong  Thanks man  likewise best of luck to you in your growth   And I agree  there was a time when Cannabis was probably helping more than hindering  it definitely helped me get through community college at a time where I hadn't really got serious about my future and was just taking classes to keep my parents pacified  but it seems like the returns have diminished to the point where its the other way around   I'm definitely not gonna be one of those ex stoners with a judgy attitude towards others for smoking  because I still have friends that smoke regularly and it does not seem to hinder them in the least   I think smoking in a weird way helped my ADD for a time  even though it slowed the pace I worked at  it helped me stick to tasks for longer   But at this point i'm going to follow the advice of my psychiatrist and begin a regime of an SSRI   Stimulant ADD medication and see how that works for me  I mean  my name is Joysticks so it would only make sense  p I would love to join Thanks for sharing your story with us  and congrats on a year sober  Absolutely  you're so spot on  In many ways I replaced my alcohol addiction with this obsession over another person   You got it  Thanks  You should write tourist pamphlets  Hell yeah  Thank you  2 hours to go and then Just for today you won't have to drink tomorrow either  This is a "We" program  We are not alone  each one of us is the sum of all our experiences  strengths  and hopes  Share more here  online somewhere else  read what everyone posts  respond  reach out to someone else   go to a meeting and share  and pick up that book  My favorite has always been pg 417  4th edition   Acceptance is the answer   God Bless  Your NYE sounds perfect  Not a loser at all  And 100 days tomorrow  That's GREAT   Just because you don't remember it doesn't mean had a bad time   Congratulations    My hope in life is that someone actually acts rude to my face  I'm all peaches and cream  but step on my toes and the Eastern European in me comes out  It's cute watching people's faces drop as they fear for their lives   Great job  Running helped me out a lot too   I'm starting running tomorrow again   Laying in bed now happy that I survived day 1   1 1 17  Checking in  clean   Get ready for some vivid dreaming   Ten years I smoked daily  and I am now on day 86 without and am back to normal sleep  but the dreams at the beginning of my sobriety were insane   Not necessarily bad dreams  though some were  but they were all so vivid and real I often didn't want to go back to sleep   I spend some of those nights reading about what they call "REM rebound"  and how long it takes to recover   It took me about 4 weeks before I got back to normal sleep with normal dreams  Lol at sugar sweaters    Congrats to you    A therapist was helpful to me  I went to meetings but a therapist gave me a professional to talk with and it was private  I learned a lot about myself and started taking better care of myself   Don't get me wrong I was destroyed with guilt afterwards and was really down that I had drank after seven months sober  but then I thought it's still seven months sober  the one slip doesn't mean I have to erase the seven months  That chain of thought is what makes a slip turn into a relapse and people get discouraged with there efforts  Instead of that I remind my self I still did seven months  and when I get to a year I will add an extra day to it and then I will say I've not drank for a year   knowing I had my slip but it still will be 365 days of not drinking none the less  Just with a one day gap in there to make the period 366  We'll actually 367 it's a leap year   this reset policy I think is taken too seriously  it should be only applied if one turns back to there old ways and starts binge drinking uncontrollably over a several days without being able to stop themselves  Not just for a single slip up  I find that's too much emotional dissatisfaction to add to an already challenging mission   maybe if you slip up week after week after week then yeah you should reset as it's obviously not working    Beautiful  Thank you My thoughts  after watching this unfold for several years with tons of people  matches your consensus   Both with the opioid  SNRI and SSRI tendencies and how those underlying connections create a very unique WD profile   There isn't anything like kratom withdrawals      it's a very bizarre constellation of symptoms and it seems as if each person gets a tailor made cluster of them     For instance  I never had insomnia or RLS   Not in any quit attempts    but it seems I had a deeper typer of fatigue than most   Very strange plant   Cool reminder why quit and continue not smoking  Thanks  I have 3 years 9 months sober   I went from my family pretty much hating me never wanting me around always talking down to me ect   Now I'm welcomed and loved by them That is what makes recovery awesome All the bs and hard work you do along the way starts paying off   I'm glad that you are able to somewhat shrug it off This might not be the last time horrible things are said to you Be strong  Happy New Year  I would agree with SOmuch2learn  completely  We all do tend to want to fix each other  Sometimes to forget to just lend an ear  Have a great year  enjoy your new place  I like your thinking   it's very positive  I think I fail at things because I'm so legalistic and tell myself 'If it's not perfect then it doesn't count ' And of course that causes me to give up  I just reset my badge a week ago because I had a beer   which I didn't even enjoy   and felt discouraged that I lost something like 78 days  Ah well  It was a learning experience anyway  Thanks for your encouragement  and cheers from rainy Southern California  Happy New Year    Well done  Keep up the great work  Children are pretty well known for saying what's on their mind  Young children don't even have the mental capacity to understand that being frank can be hurtful  It sucks to hear what they've got to say sometimes  but you can't get too phased by what children say  Their understanding of pretty ugly is primitive and discriminatory by nature  They know something as the norm  like what a doll or a TV show character looks like  and things outside that norm are weird to them  It  has nothing to do with your quality as a human being  Don't derive your self worth from a child's opinion    I say this as someone who has worked with children for many years  I've heard all kinds of things being said about me  They learn tact over time  Congrats to you   Sober life IS really worth it Things in life you didn't care so much about becomes the most important thing to you Such as your family  This   You got this  I will not drink with you today     Hey there  We're in the same exact boat  so I have no wise words  other than to reassure u that you're not alone   I think there's lots of us  I wish like hell I could afford have the time and space to just check myself into detox for a couple weeks and get this done  But even if I did that  I'd come out dragging butt  cuz the whole ordeal won't be over in 2 weeks anyway    I'm tapering too  There's absolutely zero instant gratification whatsoever in tapering either  It's slow  frustrating  and kinda tortuous  I'm so achy like u  so unmotivated  and the mornings totally suck  However  like u said  even tho you've tapered slowly  it's something  It IS something  It means u recognized it's a problem  u stopped making it worse  and you've turned in the other direction  That's what I tell myself  I was taking more and more and more Kratom  Totally out of control  If I take a teeny bit less  I WILL eventually be taking nothing  So will u  Hang in there   Happy new year  Congrats on the progress and the little one  Keep us updated  please  So what's your plan   In my experience  it's not enough to not be planning to use   I needed an active plan to keep from using   What  will you change to keep from getting in a using situation  If I am not mistaken  that quote can be attributed to Tony Robbins  I am reading his book "Awaken the Giant Within" right now  and I just watched the film about him on Netflix "I am not you fucking guru"  He is a strange and wonderful person  On my first days I did a lot of sd reading and posting   It kept me occupied and somewhat sane  It worked for me  Do you have a running plan that you will follow  I will not drink with you today   Sign me up Inspirational  well done      Weed flattens your highs and lows  thus you not really have to deal with that kind of stuff  These lows normally forces people to learn how to deal with these moments  Now that you stopped you arrived at your first low in a long time  I think what you do next is vital   This is it  100    I always say that the danger of weed isn't that it can kill you or destroy your insides  but that it creates such a strong barrier between you and reality  It makes you ok with doing nothing and going nowhere  It is soooo soothing  Under normal circumstances  negative emotions and hardships are a SIGN  A signal that   hey  something needs to change here  Something isn't right  When you're being soothed by weed 24 7  those red flags and signals become this distant whisper that we don't even hardly hear anymore    Embrace this change   brunior  Your headlights are coming back on  You can see red flags for what they are now  and rather than ignore  you can make the necessary modifications to your life   Haha great to have you  I guess i have to  too  Struggling with addiction is not something I thought I would ever have to do   Being bulimic is never understood by anyone but another bulimic  When I read this I felt every word and maybe for the first time someone feels how I feel  Nice job on this  Words are so powerful   I stopped drinking when the pain of continuing to drink outweighed the pain of quitting  While I can think of alternative additional responses  none are as correct or complete  Sign me up please    That's my go to response as well   tomorrow night is my quit smoking day  and also my quit drinking to excess night  2017 gonna suck  Yes and no  That's where I got it but I looked for the source and it may be attributed to Bill Gates in a very different context  Went to the gym from 11pm 1am so I didn't have to dwell on my sobriety while everyone else was getting fucked up   Felt good  got a great workout in  18 days here  I wish you were there  that'd have been hilarious  I shy up too easily and avoid confrontation  that 1000 yard staredown and i think you got a pretty decent boob game to play with  obvillusally i have no idea where i was going with this so happy new barf year  I am saddened to hear about your brother  but so glad you decided to reach out for help  From one brother of a problem drinker to another  I know how hard it is to watch someone harm themselves and others with the bottle  I also know what it is like to live with the remorse of my own harms done through drinking    About 4 years after I got sober  my brother began to abuse alcohol and I felt I could no longer be in his presence but for a limited amount of time  At first  every bone in my body told me to baby sit him to make sure he didn't hurt himself  After some time  and the help of others who had been there before  I realized that there is nothing I can do to keep him from drinking unless he wants the help for himself  And by trying to lessen his consequences  I could be enabling him to continue his behavior    I have tried to assist my brother in bettering himself and his situation numerous times  I've lectured him and admonished him   probably don't need to expand on the consequences of those decisions  The most effective communications that I've had with him were always when I focused on myself  avoid 'you' language  when speaking about his behavior  Be straightforward but respectful in your tone while telling him how you felt when he did x  y  or z  You can do that without saying anything about his drinking explicitly    Most importantly  I always ask myself what my motive is when communicating with someone who has just hurt me  Am I trying to get them to change by controlling his behavior  or do I want to let them know how they effected me for the sake of my own integrity and that of our relationship    I learned most of this stuff through the help of members of various 12 step groups  AA  Al Anon  ACA   If you want to learn more there is plenty of information in the form of literature and meetings of those fellowships  If you'd like some recommendations in that area please don't hesitate to contact me    Take care of yourself and remember that despite his struggles with booze  your brother does love you and is capable of change  You sound to me like a caring and supportive brother  He is fortunate to have someone in his life who wants to do what he can to understand his situation   can i sign up for this now  I havent posted here in a few days and missed the roll call  Awesome post   Congratulations   Started 11pm on 31st  Smashed my bong  cast away my remaining mix and told my mates  I spent yesterday  1st Jan  exercising and keeping my mind distracted  Feels good to be on the path  albeit for some 36 hours   Ive got my Quit Cannabis app keeping a live score in time saved   money saved and how my body is slowly regenerating and renewing  15 year daily here and I can't wait to reclaim my sobriety  Here with you and our fellow leavers here   Fistbump  Checking in  Glad you're here    Thank you  I'm with you    The most interesting  albeit understandable  trend I'm finding in the thread is the more embarrassing stories are just now being added  I'm so excited that I did not spend New Years Day hungover in bed      Oh wow    it sounds like I wrote this post  Today is my 6th day without a drink and I'm hoping it sticks this time too  We can do this we can all sponsor and support each other  I think I will definitely be using some of those tips from the other posts  You got this    I really wish I'd not lurked for years  It's really nice to feel supported and able to be honest about my problem  Glad you came back  Now I'm thinking about how delicious that fresh mint would taste in my herbal tea   Hi glad you're here and seeking help  Can you get to an urgent care or doctor  At that level of drinking you may not want to quit cold turkey it could kill you  Once you get sober that paranoia will subside  alcohol causes that   Great   Since I have  zero  reasons to drink  I have  infinite  reasons to Live Sober         So I got  that  going for me  which is nice  https   www youtube com watch v pBWcRqPesws    Thank you so much for this     I was very similar  I needed serious help  It started with a trip to my doctor  I like your perspective on keeping a positive attitude towards weed  It creates cognitive dissonance to quit something I continue to respect  but it's the hard path that creates the strongest growth  I'm in no place to decide what type of medications are appropriate for you  but I would like to share that I was diagnosed with ADHD in high school and got put on adderal  It seemed like the golden answer  I could work on anything endlessly  and had more focus and drive than ever before  It took about 3 years to catch up with me fully and bomb my whole life  It started with no appetite  then no sleep  then another medication to calm me down  and then an antidepressant because I was growing deeply depressed  Not only had I lost food and sleep to the prescribed stimulant  but I lost my friends as well  Turns out people didn't like being around someone on speed  Too much talking  lack of emotion  and zombie like characteristics arising from my inability to eat or sleep  In the end  I was on adderall for ADHD  xanax to calm down from the anxiety caused by adderall  an antidepressant to "even things out" and then     and this is the best part    my doctor decided that he wanted to add Lithium into the regimen since I was "up and down"  adderall and xanax will do that  and I was in such a jacked up mindset  I agreed  It wasn't long until I was seeing shadow people at night and having night terrors  I quit taking all medications in a personal crisis on news years eve 2008  and my life immediately turned around  I know this is an extreme example  and I was a younger and naive boy with less experience  but I almost ended up a crazy person from taking medications as prescribed by a psychiatrist  And to add to the confusion  the doctor was one of the "top in his field" and had attended something like 18 years of higher education  Whew sorry for the slight negative angle and long response  I  just can't remain silent on my experience with western meds  Best of luck in whatever works best for you  though  I know everyone's different and it might be what you need Thank you     I would like opinions on a recent claim made by a member of the SROL admin team   The claim is that the chat meeting program currently in use at SROL is a product of their own development   Here is the posting   Question  I was in a mtg and had to exit because my screen was freezing  I was given the password at the start of the mtg and when I tried to get into the mtg with the password  it gave me the error AC1727  This is not the first time this has happened to me    BTW Chris  great chat program  Wow  That's a lot of programming to bring it to completion  I heard you did the chat program yourself  Kudos dude   Response  Thank you for the compliment  The chat system was a team effort  you can read more about that here   link deleted  We will soon be releasing an update to mitigate that error  but for the moment  the best thing to do when you see that error is just to try again  Chris SMART Recovery Online  SROL  Admin  Now  considering that BigBlueButton is a OpenSource program  freely available to anyone  is it proper to make it appear it is a product developed by SROL   Discussion welcomed  Thanks I'm on the cover  fam   Well  I wasn't "shocked"  and I wasn't  denying  the problem      I was  refusing to address  it  You are here  asking for help  because you know that excuses are just BS  I am proud of you  brother  The weed in insideous  Read through the posts that others here have made  You will see that we all struggle with excuses  BUT the good news is  you are much stronger than the excuses  The path starts so hard  but every day  you get better at telling those excuses to Get the fuck out of your head   You are strong  You are brave  You can do it  We are there for you  Day 2 is just around the corner  Then day 3  4 and so on  You have friends here   I guess you find the most persistent long term withdrawal fighters among people who quitting antidepressants  I had read a few stories at http   survivingantidepressants org  It was not about the improvements after 1 2 or 3 weeks  it was about the improvements after 1 2 or 3 years    Woo Hoo   Great    You in the fold or not   Mango  go easy on him  I mean I wouldn't  but whatever   Sugar is water soluble you faking cunt    I told everyone an easy solubility experiment    You and  u timbf are fucking fakes    Literally anyone can test this and see you're wrong    For those reading this  dump sugar into a spoonful of water    See how the water soluble sugar doesn't dissolve     Now add heat  it dissolves    EVERY JUNKIE KNOWS THIS    These fucking fakes act like that isn't a thing    Fuck them    They're lying cunts  How were your dreams before quitting  Were they not nightmares or do you think you can just recall them better now  High five on 1100 days  Mr Carr made my quit easy this time too  I hope to hear about your experience   As u SOmuch2learn shares  the only requirement to be there is a desire to stop drinking   You won't be forced to do anything   I hope everything exceeds your expectations in a positive manner  I believe I'm doing this for the right reasons  I find myself wanting to have a better relationship with my wife  It even helps our sex life  Before I wasn't nearly as motivated to have sex because I was able to find an outlet elsewhere  As far as I'm concerned with my wife  she has been to hell and back with me on this  Unfortunately  I think I take advantage of her patients and forgiveness which has led to too many relapses  Quite frankly I'm surprised she has put up with me this much  I get the physical and psychological aspects of this but I think I'm too easy on myself  I don't think the community has been hard enough on me  I'm sick of not taking this seriously enough  I'm just not sure how to follow through  and I'm a little scared too I meant I don't have to worry about cardiac issues  Haha lighten up man  Why so angry  Embarassed by the truth  You have been Proven wrong admit it  Be a man for once instead of hiding behind your bottle  Its a good feeling giving something back  i got to give a lift to a friend on xmas day as his dad fell seriously ill  I supported him in his time of need and i wouldnt have been able to if I hadn't stopped    For the next couple of weeks   r cripplingalcoholism is participating in our yearly population survey   Please take a few moments to answer some questions and tell us a

information  Cheers     I am a bot  and this action was performed automatically  Please  contact the moderators of this subreddit   message compose  to  r cripplingalcoholism  if you have any questions or concerns   No rls or insomnia   Wow you might be the first  Rls seems to be the notorious hallmark of kratom withdrawal  Either way  most of us can agree that it sucks in some form or another haha I was pretty much in the same situation  I've been struggling with a breakup for the last month and of course that night I dreamt about her again so right off the bat waking up I was feeling a little down  I went for a drive in the morning and then a walk through the woods to ease my mind  Met up with my buddy and told him I think I'm going to have some beer that night  I could tell he was hesitant in agreeing with my decision but I said I've thought it through and I want to give it a try after being sober for a while  I knew I was sad and drinking is never the answer  but I went with it anyways   Grabbed my signature drink  12 pack of 6  and cracked the first one around 4pm  Took my long whiff before I had a sip as I've always done  Struggled to get through 3 before our ride showed up 3 5 hours later  At the party I started drinking a little faster to try and mimick how I used to do things  Started a "deep" conversation with someone about humans and our perception of senses and I noticed when people are drinking it's more of a one way convo  Neither party really wants to listen but rather only say their opinions  I could tell he was getting frustrated so I removed myself from the situation  I noticed how people were talking about their problems and saying how they needed alcohol in their life to subdue their emotions  I also noticed how fake a lot of these emotions were while intoxicated  Laughing harder to fit in  etc   It wasn't the same as before  I didn't enjoy the alcohol  In all honesty  I mostly wanted to go to try and get laid so I could take my mind off things but that wasn't happening  I still love her too much  I had my vape  a Christmas present  stolen from me so I decided to go home and call it a night  Instead of walking I jogged for the 45 minute trip before finally hitting the bed   I awoke this morning with not so much shame as before  Bittersweet really  She decided to message me at 4am telling me about her evening over at her sisters  So today I was right where I was yesterday stuck thinking of her  This time I didn't go to the booze  I had started drawing then broke down and talked to my mother instead  I no longer want alcohol  It just doesn't suit me anymore and I don't enjoy the numbness  I feel much better after crying and dealing with my emotions head on compared to how I did when I drank to numb them out   I think I've finally reached the point I'm ready to let go  I just don't enjoy drinking anymore  It's a relief  and I always thought if I gave it another go  especially with the state I'm in I'd cave and hit another binge but no  not anymore  So this is a new year but more importantly  a new day  Knowing that I have zero temptation to drink anymore is probably the best feeling I can have   I read the book How to Control Drinking by Allen Carr and in the last chapter he asks to have one final drink and be aware of that drink as you consume it  I didn't do that step so I treated last night like that  Safe to say I understand everything now and am ready to finally stop with the relapses and close this chapter  Thank you to everyone here at SD  This will probably be my last post for a long time as I feel I've used the resources given to me and now I can make room for someone else  Here's to sobriety  and here's to a better future for all of us  I hope everyone else can reach this point as well  we are all capable of beating alcohol  Don't stress over relapsing  just keep trying and it will come   Also  sorry about jumping in your thread like this  I started writing and got a little side tracked  Yes it is stressful  like different parts of the brain are fighting  I keep reminding the impulsive part of my brain of the emptiness in porn  that its an empty promise  Sugar and heroin are two different substances  They have different structures and thus dissolve differently  I made a thread for you  You are wrong  Unless every person on r o is also wrong and we're not    We are done here  Thank you for this  the symbolism here is powerful  Statements like these are a great reminder that I'm supposed to feel the things I've been experiencing   Today and the last couple of days have been pretty tough  but I'm pulling through  Haha  Happy New Year to you too     Proven wrong    You must be high    Anyone can verify what I'm saying  Great Resource Guide  Thank you for posting this  I'm around your age and I was just thinking that "am I too young " a few minutes ago  Reading your thoughts is helpful thank you   You can totally do this  We all can  You inspired me to make a post about this very thing lol    Best of luck   Why are you here  Happy New Year  Uncle S   I can't have alcohol in the house  I'm too impulsive  Kudos to you  I really do try to be polite  but when it comes down to it do not cross me   Very cool  congrats   Awww   Love this PG  How appropriate      I agree with the previous responses  You may need a detox  Sounds serious to me  You can stop  Sober in Saint Paul here  I've found the zen meetings to be really helpful  and with almost no mention of AA literature and religion  usually   Common Ground Meditation Center  The Zen Center  and Clouds and Water all have meetings     I lost track of how many steps backwards in the last year   Some of them were right over a cliff   I'm not sure how I would have done if I had been anywhere near alcohol in the last week or so   I've yet to be truly tested  I'm hoping that when the time comes  I won't forget what bits I've learned along the way so far   I'd like nothing more than to see you back on track   I've learned a lot from you already  I look forward to learning more in the coming sober days   especially today   Good luck to you my friend   I'll see you at "2" tomorrow  My Groundhog wishes you and your Mom  Happy Sober New Year  Wow I'm surprised you were able to let that slide  good on ya for having a tougher skin  If someone said that to me I'd be right pissed off  Although that's just because I have a tendency to overreact in general  even when sober  So take pride in that you did what I probably would not  Either way what counts is that we're sober  Sign me up  lets do this  Are you me      Thanks for the reply  Thank you so much  I'll be here   Thanks so much  the encouragement means a lot      Looking forward to that moment myself  Well done  I can't talk in your thread  you guys muted me in a place I have never been    And yes  they're two different substances  but how solubility works doesn't magically change  regardless of the substance    You two fakers need to piss off  then we'll be done  I agree with the other posts  It might be a good idea to see a Dr or go to the ER Right   It's going to be a sweet space  I'm super excited   Its late in the uk so not drinking with you tonight and I will spot you for tomorrow   Great job not dirnking  And that's a lot of drinking normalization intertwined into GT culture  No wonder we internalize this stuff   I just realized I won't get to watch PSU in the Rose Bowl unless we go out to a bar or find a friend who will be watching it  we don't have cable   Oh well   Congrats on the GT win  btw  I remember that you started with Kratom and Wellbutrin almost at the same time   It takes some weeks for Wellbutrin to work properly  and that could maybe the case now    I'll not drink today  Stay strong   I'm on day 1 too  I was very close to smoking a bowl but I reminded myself why I am doing this  I also just keep telling myself just get through today    we can worry about tomorrow tomorrow   Great  I hope your liver has reacted well    Do you have plans to reflect on your feelings as you go through this month sober  That might be the most telling  I'm not much of a journal keeper  but I do find it to be helpful to write about this part of my life  as you say above  it helps to lay it all out    I hadn't thought about it  but that's a nice idea  thanks   I'm not much of a journal keeper either  but I try it now and then   You're right that it could be a useful tool in reflecting and making decisions moving forward  Great job on one year    Those things taste like cough syrup but you cant beat the  14 abv  You got to party and you feel good the next day  great stuff  These all sound like good reasons not to drink  thanks for sharing  I'll not drink with you today  i've been trying to work on it for about 6 years  but i have no desire to work on it at this point  typically in the past i'd restrict  more lately i've been binging and purging and restricting  it's very frustrating  i just want to go back to my restricting tendencies Me  Mom and our Groundhog wish you and your family a Happy  Healthy  Peaceful and Sober New Year  I'm trying very hard to help her with my NY resolution hope for her  Please  for heaven's sake  stop hiding and throwing away her med's   The tech actually had to shut down her machine at dialysis on Saturday AM because she got sick  BUT   I'm sober  so there's that      Checking in  Good look to everyone and happy new year  Checking in  Good look to everyone and happy new year  You can comment on the sub  Just not in modmail anymore   Man I love your posts https   www reddit com r opiates comments 5lhchd heroin argument please settle this for me  No gaming on my phone  I don't own a console or PC  I'm committing to a 90 day detox    I'm doing this because videogames take up far too much time and they're bad for me mentally and physically  That would definitely help me to have a SO that did not drink   My husband is looking forward to having drinks   I am feeling strong though   I think having a plan is the key   We CAN do this   My self identified worst quality is the tendency to overreact  so I was especially proud of myself when I didn't go off the deep end  Sobriety has forced me to get it in check and it's definitely been useful when put in situations like the one today I think the fact that you are questioning your drinking habits indicates that you already realise that it is a problem  The fact that you made the decision to do something dangerous to yourself and other people like drunk driving  a decision you wouldn't couldn't make sober  indicates that your drinking causes you to do things that are problematic to you  Read ' this naked mind ' which can be found for free on the sidebar   The first weeks were really tough for me  things did get better  Great job on another day  Thank you    So nice to hear a success story for this scenario   I CAN do it        Congratulations on a year Planned

you all  For once on New Years I didn't feel like throwing up during breakfast   Good call for the cost benefit chart    I'll consider that homework     As you adjusted  did you find a lot of your friends and typical social activities were no longer a good fit   That worries me were I to quit in the long term  There is a ton of great advise on this sub  One of the things that I have seen repeatedly here is "if you are on this site asking if you have an alcohol problem  most likely you do"  Not everyone who has an alcohol problem looks or acts like the stereotypical "drunk" that you have an image of in your head  To put it simply drinking the way I did was a problem for me  therefore I had an alcohol problem  I didn't have to hit rock bottom to know that I had to change my relationship with alcohol  I can't stop at 1 or 2  therefore I can't allow myself to start again  I hope this ramble helps  Cheers to not drinking together today  Congratulations on making it so far   That's OK man  I'm still going to not PMO no matter what  I'm resolved to get better at looking out for triggers  I knew I was not in a good state of mind  and I should not have brought my computer into my room   I sincerely wish that you have the strength to continue to fight and improve yourself  This minor setback will be only a small bump on the road to becoming a better individual   Happy new year to you  I'm starting to realize sobriety is a process  I reset my badge many times but I keep trying  Everytime I fell off the wagon just added to the mountain of evidence that drinking is not good for me  Seems like everytime I fell off the wagon  my drinking was more out of control  It made my resolve stronger as I did not want to see where I ended up if I continued drinking  Please don't beat yourself up and above all  DON'T GIVE UP   I am going through a difficult time emotionally  but when I drink I get even more sad  depressed and emotional  Good luck in your recovery  Instagram is the  1 trigger for me too  Me too  Snowshoeing in the mountains  Everyone on the path was cheery and it was the place to be  Starting the new year out right  cant be much worse then the last one  fuck i jinxed it  You also just said you dont want to ever die  so why dont you try picking one  perhaps the better option   I remember feeling like I had this new super power early in sobriety  No matter what time of day or night it was  I could operate a car safely  Almost done with the first day hahaha I'm in on this  Hi There   Been there done that   I was a fifth a day drinker   When I was awake I was drinking   I felt really guilty about it but I couldn't stop   I was drinking to cover up unpleasant feelings in my head   My problem was starting to weigh on my job  my family  and me   I was involuntarily yanked out of my very good job and went to treatment for three motnhs   My last drink was in February 2016   I feel so much better now but I still have a long way to go   The one thing that helps me the most to stay sober is to seek out and hang out with other people like me   Their story is my story   I get it   The more I do the better I feel and I've really had no obsession to drink since   I wish you the best  Like I said before  I can't participate in your thread cause you fucks muted me    They do dissolve differently  but it's not  completely dissimilar    We'll be done here when you two fake motherfuckers who pre ban people piss off    Cunts open a thread  ban me  then act like I won't participate    That's shady as fuck   Luck is great  and I believe in both of you  I believe you have it in you to overcome your battles and be the 2017 champions  I appreciate women's AA meetings  I also attend agnostic meetings  Good luck  If you get that crystal ball   mind sharing it with me   I drove myself crazy most of 2016 wanting to know what the universe had in store for me   I wanted answers  and I wanted them then an there   Hah   The universe laughed at me and said  "The one question you must answer is simple  will you drink today    Answer that properly and all will be revealed in good time "  I know what I wanted to tell the universe it could do with its so called good time  but I decided it best not to piss off the universe   Hang in there TSrW   we can all do this thing if we never stop trying   I will try my best today with you  Oh hell man  that sounds really rough  I can understand your problem with alcohol  when I'm drunk  I'm not a nice person  I've done so many stupid things under the influence that just  aren't  things I would do if I were sober   I hope everything works out and you're back home soon  I hope you'll check in again  and you and me can not drink together  I went to the ER one year ago today   I was drinking about 20 drinks a day  from morning to night   They gave me a bag of fluids  monitored my blood pressure and sent me home with some meds   I followed up with my family doctor 2 days later   Good luck to you  We banned you from modmail  not from the sub  Try to comment on the sub  If you cant i will unmute you  But the thread was up for at least 45 minutes after i sent you the link and before i muted you  Yeah I've heard it taking longer for some people  Either way  it does get better eventually  I must be one of the lucky people because I was about 80 90  better by the end of week 2 and back to baseline by 3 3 5 weeks  This was cold turkey attempt after a little less than 2 years daily up to 30 40g daily  Was clean for awhile then relapsed for a few months  This time I'm tapering and its been a lot easier  Almost unnoticeable some days  Mostly just a mental game  Kratom is a funky drug and the severity varies widely for people and for different experiences  My first time I was waking up every morning with sweats and rls  This time  I rarely encounter that  but deal more with cravings and lack of motivation  I'd say on average it takes anywhere for 2 weeks to 8 weeks to feel back to baseline  Some shorter  some longer Hey  friend  I ended up in the ICU after a terrible drinking binge   It was the best thing that could have happened to me   I think that seeking medical advice is the best way to go   It gave me the strength to make it back to sobriety   I'm in the US    I actually was using the medical cost as an excuse as to why I didn't want to go to the doctor   and then I ended up taking the ride by ambulance   You deserve all of the wonderful things that sobriety offers  so I hope that you decide to seek some medical supervision to take the steps that you'll need to take when ready   Best wishes of good health   happiness to you  I hope you are able to quit  the feeling of not knowing what happened the night before is the worst thing about drinking for me  it seems like it is always something terrible  I wish I didn't wait another 30 years beyond your age before I finally realized what drinking was doing to me   If I had found the wisdom and courage to face this thing early on  I think   no  I know   that I would have been far better off for it   You have the opportunity to turn this thing around at a relatively young age   I wish I had seen and taken that opportunity   As others have said here  it's best to seek out all the medical help and emotional support you can   This is a good place for the latter  366 tho I will not drink with you today  Glad you are here     Thank you this does help   Thanks u guys  I really love recovery and all the people in it  Made first meeting tonight and I really really feel great  Thanks God I got out of the house  Thanks again and Happy New Year   Thx  I will not drink or smoke today  Keeping my short streak live  Done with that stuff  I had a great sober time in 2016  Moving forward in 2017  I am about to go through the same thing myself  Been smoking everyday for the last 2 and a half years  Hardest thing for me I know is going to be able to get decent sleep  I have been dependent on weed to fall asleep for so long that I know I'll just lay there wide awake without smoking  Appetite will be affected as well  And I get mood swings and night sweats when I quit after heavy use  Not going to be fun  I have quit several times before but I always seem to come back  Good luck to you my friend   good luck to PSU   know a lot of alums from there   great to see y'all relevant again    hopefully  the worst of it behind you    I would avoid it like the plague for the rest of your life man  it is truly not worth you "testing" the waters  You have no idea what is in store with you if you carry the gene  Alcohol ruined my 20's and nearly my life  My biological father is an alcoholic whom I do not know  My biological mother was a drug addict and did time  I cannot stress how much you should not take a drink  But this life you have is your journey so it is ultimately up to you   Well said   Thanks   YVW     You're nearly 2 weeks in   One year from now that will mean your badge is nearly 400   Stick with this   you can do it    Good luck man  I'm 63 days without PMO and found that easier to kick than my cigarette habit  Lem's gonna Lem You can totally do this  "You deserve all of the wonderful things that sobriety offers  "  Amazingly put  Thank you for your thoughts    OP  you're never too far gone  We're all here with you  and we won't drink with you today   Double amen to that P G  This is by no means my first go at quitting  but I will suggest getting yourself the fizzy drinks of your choice to replace that need for glass in hand  I like tonic with lime   some sweets  and a new thing to keep you occupied  Oh and stick around this sub  I won't drink with ya  Feelings on individual spirituality aside   Wayne Dyer has interesting thoughts on this  which my spouse eloquently rephrased  "you have to go to a specific store  in Colorado anyway   you have to take out your wallet and show your ID to someone with the exclusive intent to buy something you're telling me you didn't intend to buy   isn't it easier to just  not do that in the first place "  Well  yeah  but when I was drinking  any and all logic flew out the window when I was buying what was killing me and I feel that might be the case for others  When that animal is gnawing at you  it's hard to be present    But that's why this amazing place exists  and we're all here for each other  Congratulations    Thank you     I definitely identified with your post  Glad you're here  and I will not drink with you today  You're pretty wise  PG   checking in  Hi mermaidbadbich    This sub is really supportive and is full of useful information x I too have trauma from earlier on in my life  I'm currently seeing a therapist and trying to work my way through it  I think drinking for me can be a way of self medicating    I remember hearing those words a while back "self medicating" and thinking  pfft    I'm just trying to have a good time   that's not me    The more I deal with things that trigger me and confront and work through why I am the way I am  the more chance I have to heal and lead a happy healthy life  Therapy may not be for everyone  but it's a suggestion  I don't want to be a slave to the past either  It's awesome you have a supportive boyfriend x  Sometime just posting on here and getting it all out helps me a lot too  also reading other peoples stories  It helps keep me strong  I hope to see you around here    Good  No big cravings yet  It's largely been a matter of "hmmn i ought to have a ciggarrette   OH WAIT I DON'T DO THAT ANYMORE" I'm anxious for future days but I reckon I can get through it  I always somehow thought that going cold turkey would be too stressful that it's not worth it   but every time I've tried to convince myself that i can just cut down I've failed  This is working for me  because I've always struggled with "never" but then again you have to recognize that an addiction is an addiction and its not like I enjoy cigarettes anyway  I can't tell you how many times I slipped up on Day 4  What is that about  Congrats and keep it up  I won't drink with you today  For the next couple of weeks   r

HALF WIT  I CAN'T COMMENT ON YOUR SUB  FUCKING HALF WIT  I hope you go  relax  and enjoy the coffee and the comfort of being around like minded people      "How would i become the chatty  funny  easy going girl everyone likes to be around " I would describe drinking as having done the exact same thing for me  and when I first started it was hugely appealing  I thought I was becoming the real me  But the amount of socializing and how I acted in social situations was out of sync with my true nature and really  my soul  This dissonance started to create more stress as time went on  Relationships take energy and as my alcohol use continued  friendships started to fall apart as poorly as the foundation they were built on  I was spending a lot of time with people I wasn't even sure I liked  and some of them I actively didn't really like  but I thought having friends was more important than that  I swapped quality for quantity and even my true  loving friendships were built on a foundation of alcohol misuse    Eventually my problem with drinking got extreme enough that I was willing to give up any social benefits  there were basically none left at this point anyway   even worse  it had all fallen apart and gotten worse than I ever could have imagined   I was willing to give up the escape and social lubrication  I decided I would rather find out who I really was  even if that's a sensitive  socially anxious sort of introvert   I knew I had to quit because every single other thing I tried to fix my problems was like putting a bandaid on a gushing pipe  But quitting drinking was like hiring a pipe fitter to fix the pipe  My gut told me there was a serious problem when I drank and that quitting was the way out of my insanity and misery  Wow  our timelines match perfectly  I'm with you on that  I've never tried an anti depressant  but that quick fix sounds nice at times  However  I agree completely about not trusting it or the docs prescribing it  I've also heard they have to test a bunch sometimes to see what will even work  so I assume by that point I'll be out of it on my own  Not worth it    I have been exercising regularly since quitting and that helps immensely  Only problem is  the feeling is short lived  The depression comes in waves now which is better  but the last wave lasted much longer which worried me  My diet was shit  so I've actually just started to try eating cleaner  Hopefully that will help  So far I'm just making a kale shake with protein and fruit in the morning  I need to do more  but it's a start    Thanks for the advice  I'm gonna work on my diet now  Good luck to you as well  and happy new year   Skin heals  as  u MyMuddyEyes said  but a heightened sense of empathy and the ability to see past others' physical imperfections are two things that can be earned while living with CSP   I don't flinch when I see defects  surgery scars  burns  birth marks  I know there's a person standing in front of me who is very aware of their imperfections  as I am of mine    I know what it is to be ugly    I also want and deserve my dignity  as do they    That kid will likely never attain that level of understanding about the people in their life  or be able to use it to their advantage in relationships  But you have  and you can  That's awesome   I find that when I get to help someone else out  I get just as much out of it as they do  Wait      You play billiards  Like the classic version  I thought I was the last one  Hah    ew    I'm as unfeminist as they come but fuck off with that bullshit  Maybe you need to figure out why you're angry  You can totally do it man    Don't waste any more of your time on a shit game   Be careful with the demon that is suboxone It sounds like you are forming a pretty solid plan   I think that putting the word out to people in your circle is key    you've done that already   I know that distraction is my best friend when it comes to staying sober   If I get in a funky mood and start to think of drinking  I'll stop whatever I am doing in the moment and move on to something enjoyable for a bit  reading a chapter in a book I like  browsing the internet  or talking to a friend on the phone for a bit    I hope this helps    I will not drink with you today if that helps  too     Try to find s nee hobby  Also just streaming anything or video games that you can crawl through help a ton for the first few months  I was smoking to numb the pain      My boyfriend was cheating on me and ignored me  It made me feel unattractive and unloved  I'm a Leo and I thrive on that       Once I left him I kept smoking because I was so lonely  I would smoke all the time because I didn't want to be alone  I still struggle with this but everyday gets easier    I've tried quitting over and over in the last two months  This is my longest stretch at 10 days and when I did smoke it was social puff puff     I work really hard to be social and create true friendships but that takes a lot of time  The friends that did stick by me    help me every step of the way   I'll unmute you but if you continue with the insults there I'm just going to do it again  You'll notice i have been polite here   Welcome    I want to share a not so secret with you   Not one of us has ever been sober today before    This is it  it is all any of us get  today   Now with that in mind  there are many of us who have stayed sober  one day at a time  for a few days in a row   I wish you the best of luck on that  just keep in mind  you only need to worry  or not worry  about not drinking today     It gets better    Enjoy the journey   No more solo playing or watching of any sort or form     You don't even know how to run the sub  you're wrong about basic information    It's a goddamned embarrassment you and fucktard are a mod of  r opiates        Embarrassment   Perhaps shortbread would make a good substitute for whisky  Else  Lidl was giving out lumps of coal this year for this very purpose   I find drinking weird  too  nowadays  Basically  getting pished on NY eve is like saying "this occasion is so special that I need to make sure I remember nothing of it"    Happy new year  I played dark souls 3   all freaking day   I'm getting over the flu or the cold or some crap  but it's still better than getting over a hangover and wondering who the girl next to me is   desperately searching for an open condom wrapper   Times have changed  Hey  I just got off subs myself  day 36   it was hard  but worth it  I was on them for about 2 years also   What I really wanted to say though is that I have severe gym anxiety too  and I definitely needed to lose weight  so I bought an awesome workout DVD and started doing everything I could think of to get exercise around the house  I even started walking in circles around the living room while binge watching Netflix  My kids laughed their asses off at how ridiculous it looked  but hey     it worked    Anyway  good luck  Congratulations  may this year be filled with joy  Have I gone blind  2016 was a year of almost pure crap for me too   But one good thing did come out of it   our dedication to sobriety   Not drinking right alongside you today  I play billiards  I like to play chess as well  but I suck at it  It's fun  though  Dry people  dry places resonated a lot with me  Maybe I'll try again tomorrow  It all starts with not drinking the first drink    I won't drink with you today   Alcohol has a way of doing that  The initial feeling of pleasure comes on quickly and subsides as quickly and we spend the rest of the night drinking more  chasing that feeling  Problem is  it's a depressant and it prolongs the problems  all of them  Physical issues  Mental issues  All of them    Best way to stop this  Stop drinking  Just for today  Don't drink  Wake up tomorrow and see how you feel tomorrow  I won't drink with you today    Be kind to yourself  Do something that brings you pleasure  Hot bath  Read a book  Play video games  Cook  Binge on Netflix  Eat chocolate    Make a plan  You can do this  My dad hasn't   He has alienated his entire family     I  however  am a mom and am working really hard to recover    One day at a time    Just stop completely   you'll have to eventually anyway  Kratom will stop working and you'll be worse off than you are now  Your addict mind probably won't be able to stop completely unless you really want it  Good luck with your decision  I can relate to your problems  I missed the boat with Instagram  Besides relapse fodder  and a billion bucks  is it artistically worth anything  You are showing great restraint  Very impressive  Thank you for this  Her comment about secretly hoping to get banned and not needing an excuse to quit has hit home with me    Since the end of 2014 I have gone through periods of non gaming and gaming but I have secretly wanted my gaming PC to break so that I have a reason to get a laptop instead  I couldn't justify buying a latpop while my PC was working as it was perfectly functional and more powerful than any laptop would be so spending money on a laptop seemed like a waste   This video has made me realize I have been making excuses to keep my tools of gaming in the house and keep the temptation of competitive escapism  false fulfillment and comfort alive  Edit  I don't need an excuse to quit and get rid of my PC  I just need to do it and want the change for myself   ignoring sunk cost etc   Classic East European heritage  Where from   I'll take a guess at Poland  but edge my bets with Hungary  Same for me both counts  Started today   Thank you so much for sharing your story and thoughts with us and congratulations on one year    "There wasn't much of a grey area when it came to my addiction to alcohol  I didn't gradually become addicted to it like some  starting out with a drink here and there at social gatherings  Instead  from the get go  I drank alcohol to get severely drunk and impaired  My first night out drinking  I chugged dangerous amounts of hard alcohol  knowing it would "fuck me up " For some messed up reason  that is how I wanted to feel  My memories of that night and those first nights drinking are hazy and difficult to describe  I was 18  just out of high school  and I had not touched a drop during high school  I'm still figuring out how I went from there to daily drinking so fast  I do know that I sought out alcohol as an escape from myself and my life and from how I felt about myself  The rush excited me and made me feel like I was in control of my happiness "  Really really struck home with that  Thank you for sharing  and you're certainly not alone  I was a stiff no drugs or alcohol kid in high school and college  but after some workplace challenges  I started hitting alcohol hard  and with the exclusive goal of getting messed up as quickly as possible  That awful anxiety over feeling "not drunk enough" and wanting more   I've done so many things that make me shake my head in the pursuit of that stuff   You're an amazing person and great work getting to where you are  12 3 17 I'll be writing my own one year testament  But it is a difference whether one makes a cold withdrawal or not  You have the help of Elavil  This is of course all right   I preferred a cold withdrawal  This was really harsh  but I guess it will keep me away from Kratom forever      I won't drink with you today  Heh   And people think we are the judgemental ones  My thoughts  is this is great   Congratulations   Whoop whoop   Congrats  Thanks for sharing that  It's crazy how weed can numb the pain  isn't it  I was also having relationship issues  My smoking also pushed quite a few good guys away  and even THAT wasn't a wake up call  A guy I was dating dumped me because I was soooo cranky without weed  He was a non smoker and just couldn't deal with it  It took me sobering up to look back like damn I really let his fine ass get away because I wanted to smoke all the time  Smh  Hindsight   The number of times I fudged my numbers for doctors was epic    Agreed  It's all relative to each individual   Romania    Really close  I write and speak fluently  If I wasn't such a drunk I'd go back to translating  well  the good thing is that I'm starting a project bike with a friend  so I'll be just as broke but I won't be bored and I'll have a cook motorcycle by the end of it checking in This   One day at a time  Some people are addicts  some not  If you are an addict  maybe it's easier to give it up completely and live your life rather than fantasizing and anticipating your next scheduled high  which probably is not nearly as good as in your imagination  Bike riding   physical exercise in general is not a bad way to go   I don't know any of you  but all of you have a place in my heart  Its funny how it's so hard to find understanding amongst those who know us  yet you all offer your support despite having never met me  I don't know if i will stop drinking  Im in tears because it all seems so hard   checking in Cool beans    I was terrified walking into my first meeting     I was more terrified that I was going to die drunk     Best thing I ever did was walking into an AA meeting     I wish you the best   I feel you man  Mm I understand the thought process and what you are trying to say  however  this post seems like it will be more harmful then helpful on this sub    To each their own though   congrats on your 11 days   I've starting seeing this girl who hates cocaine and doesn't know I use it and I really like her so I'm going to try and fill up my freetime by being with her Acknowledging the issues is the first step into cold water  Unfortunately it is the easiest step  but at least you've put yourself out there and begun   If you don't mind me asking  long have you been clean  You can do this  You can  A  90 quarter would typically last me 5 days    Nearly  20 day or close to  600 month  I have spent the last of my bank account on weed more than once    I  am  so  ashamed  I really hope this is the time I quit for real  In my case it's mostly irritability  awful night sweats and vivid dreams  For example  me  I know for a fact if I smoked a spliff tonight as a one off  I'd want one tomorrow  And the day after  And the day after  I've been addicted for 3 years and now 10 days clean and never felt better  I don't even want to smell the stuff again let alone smoke it  new phone who dis I have never taken Kratom but I was a huge on off pain pill addict for years  What you've described in your first post is word for word things I experienced when in w ds  or just not taking enough  or just strung out in general       I quit all that shit   and I never feel like that anymore  Even on bad days   where stupid frustrating life shit happens  it's never as awful as what you're experiencing   Quit the shit if you can man  You'll be glad you did  While I know Kratom and narcotic pain killers aren't exactly alike chemically    they do tickle the brain in similar ways  Our bodies weren't designed to need any of this shit  And your body also has an amazing ability to heal   Does anyone know what you're going through  Face to face support is helpful   Feel free to PM me anytime  I don't post here often bc I've never taken Kratom    but your post hit me hard bc I've been there     but I'm not there anymore  You can do it  Me  I went to a hot yoga class with blacklights and a DJ instead and it was great   Happy New Years everyone   Dammit  Romania is a gorgeous country  hopefully get a chance to go there again one day  This is a lie  Kratom may seem like a miracle drug  but it absolutely is not  It prolongs your addiction and can coat a fortune  After switching from a terrible oxy and ambien habit to Kratom  I thought I had it all figured out  However  my kratom needs grew and when I eventually wanted out  I found Kratom produced some horrible opiate withdrawals  along with ssri snri withdrawals  Kratom is NOT an option for an addict  period  If you really want out  this is the looooooooong hard road   Let's do this  We can do it  Are you fucking kidding me    You and your bud have made yourselves into a goddamned joke     Go fuck yourself and your made up bullshit  Someones getting angry    Hurts to be wrong  Sigh so sad man  You could have said sorry  Fash and I are two of the most giving and forgiving members on Reddit  You come here to our place and start shit  Please enough with being so insecure  I JUST DID THIS TOO  Hahaha  great day for a walk  it seems  Congrats  OP  I'm glad you enjoyed   Oh the cunts who pre banned me are the adults    Go fuck yourself you goddamned posuer  You were proven wrong time and again  Holy Fuck you can read   I'm in the same boat as you    The first 7 days consisted of no sleep or food but I expected that  What I didn't expect was the depression that set in on day 8  Stay strong  we don't want to have to go through the withdrawal twice   I didn't realize how much coffee creamer my wife and I used until we went on a 4 day vacation out of state  We bought a quart of creamer because they never have enough in the hotels  It only took us 4 days to kill a quart of coffee creamer   Concur  chess is amazing but fret not  I suck at it too  We should start a CAshittychessclub   or not  Great post Victoria  Happy New Year  Welcome  SD has a lot to do with my making it 14 days  It has been what I lean when I need inspiration or tips to help me work through the urge to drink  Hasn't been easy  but it's gotten better     Glad you're here  Romania is beautiful  but the people are so corrupt  I haven't been back since I moved here at 11  I hope to visit soon  but family wise there's not much left there for me  Ugh  the not sleeping        I'm on day 36 off of subs and I still have a hard time sleeping sometimes  The first 2 weeks were the worst though  I barely managed an hour or 2 here   there  if I was really lucky  I really thought I was going crazy  It's amazing how much lack of sleep starts to screw with you after a while   It gets better though   once you get a decent nights sleep the sense of accomplishment is huge  I'm not sure what you're detoxing from  but hopefully it won't take you as long to get there as it does with subs   Great job  Leave  Ahhh shortbread is a good shout  I used to do it with coal when I was a kid  Scottish kid in south London though  I'm sure my neighbours were freaked out by the small girl with the weird accent standing in their doorway holding out coal    I played a game of sober new year bingo with myself on the walk into town and the walk back  Girls Crying  couples arguing  men leering  shoeless walkers  sick on the pavements  kebab remains  Got house in under a mile   Being on the outside it's so so alien   which I guess is good because it's steadily replacing the fomo  hey everybody  i'm new   been in horrible CT w d's for a week now   so far  absolutely no relief   hopefully i can continue checking in on these threads    I worked until 12 am then watched some HBO Online and woke up this morning at 1pm    there was a thunderstorm outside and I took advantage of the rumbling thunder to dream  I am 4 months sober today and a bonus I woke up to 2017 this way  So grateful and happy today   Good luck every one  I'll checkin   I was scared to death on day 2   What do you mean I can never drink again   I've been doing it for 10 months one day at a time   It does get easier  I wish I could say my dad recovered but he hasn't  I'm also losing hope of it ever happening  This past year he was hospitalized twice for alcohol induced pancreatitis  They dried him out both times  giving him the perfect opportunity to get sober and stay sober  Two days later  he picked up right where he left off which tells me he doesn't want to get sober  I believe he likes the attention it gets him too much   Sign me up I MUTED you for 72 hours because you were combative  I did not ban you  And you are now unmuted   I'm totally up for that  I would like to play chess with drunk  shitty players as myself  Thank you  I dread to think how the situation would go down if I was drinking   Absolutely  It helps me to be open and honest about what I've sacrificed  within myself  in order to maintain my habit  That brutal honesty is what helps me keep going  even if it's a shock to my ego  If I keep up the lie that "weed hasn't had any effect on me"  I get nowhere    I got to a month clean and then had a tiny relapse  took 2 puffs of a joint and immediately regretted it  and that was about 3 weeks ago  Been clean ever since    It has only been 6 days since I last smoked   This is my second serious attempt at quitting and I was doing really good last time until my partner of 30  years died and sent me into a tailspin and I reached for weed to help me through   I was clean for 3 months that time and I remember the dreams starting in the first few days   I have smoked high grade for over 30 years and was a wake n baker   I hope the dreams start soon  You don't know the kind of girl I'm talking about  Agree with r somuchtolearn    A week in and I was still a bit of a mess    Glad you're seeing a Dr   Hey man its worth it  I don't know where you are  I'm Australia   But if there's a chance of serious repercussions it's worth every penny trying to get the best result     I had to get clean for the courts  clean urine samples for the judge and I had no intention to get clean once I proved I was good and not a burden to society  Then I got given a 12 months order and had to take more drug tests  So not wanting to go to jail I tried to stick to it and thought once I hit 12 months I'm going to blaze up like Marley himself    Little did I know how amazing life would get and I saw how much weed was slowing me down  Almost 15 months clean and can now see what a blessing it was to get in trouble  I may have wasted many more years till I decided to try and quit again  Yeah  I don't get the deal with "real" ramen  It's only marginally better than the shit that's 50 cents and costs 20x more    This swig of 40 is to you and yours  May she be the subject of many good posts in 2017 but only positive ones like this    I've thought multiple times that I should give up drinking  That scares me because what would I do on the weekends  How would I relax  How would I become the chatty  funny  easy going girl everyone likes to be around   Alcohol is a really excellent crutch  it works fast  it's easy to get  and it's extremely effective at temporarily solving a lot of problems  When I decided to get sober  I had to work really  really hard to re wire my brain on a lot of things    Relaxing  Video games  some comfortable PJs and a hot cup of kava tea get the job done these days  Weekend activities  Backlogged chores errands  dinner with my parents  dates with my fiance  catching up on TV shows and video games    the list goes on  Socialization  I don't go out or socialize as much as I used to  and don't think I'm as nearly fun as I used to be   but I'm honestly okay with it  I've always been a more introverted person and I find that I'm thoroughly enjoying the extra quiet time with a clear head  I was a binge drinker from my very first drink  Today I have multiple years of sobriety and a completely different  better life  It can be done   Post surgery I was taking norcos and finally quit but still had pain  I found kratom and it works better for pain and gives me a little energy and a positive mind frame  I do not mess with extracts as I have heard they will ruin tolerance  They are also really expensive  Yes  kratom can be addictive but for me it's better than all those pills   If it weren't rather late  where knifey is  I'd propose an online game  Maybe tomorrow    Kick ass  Brother  So glad to hear that you had a good day  Keep passing it forward  Your story can help others   I found it had to be my decision to stop  just be absolutely done  I Anthony Bordaine this shit now and every day  week  month is a gift I give to myself   Thanks  I sure hope so  I stopped watching for a few years because of all of the drama  but I started watching again this year  Even if we don't win  I'm still happy with our progress this year and happy to have gotten back to the Rose Bowl  Don't matter    no wonder she don't want you  She's all over me  dude  And everyone else   Good point    I think a lot of people that smoke are depressed  Quitting will only make the depression shine strong  It requires a whole life change to get better  not just putting down the buds  I have been in your shoes trying to quit for 5  years without success until recently  I can tell you what worked for me if it helps   1  I removed access to my games  I did this by breaking my laptop and moving to a different city away from my toxic home environment  a bit extreme but in my case desperate times called for desperate measures    An alternative would be to uninstall all games  block all gaming websites and subreddits you visit  and clear your YouTube watch and search histories so gaming video recommendations don't appear   2  After my last relapse  I fully realised I was done with gaming for life   but the addiction can always trick me back into gaming and to avoid this I started avoiding anything video game related  websites  videos  even thoughts  like a plague   3  Support from others  I tried and failed to quit by myself for years as I mentioned  I now realise that getting support from others is probably essential  especially in my case as I don't have a good social support network   I do this by attending a CGAA meeting everyday  Initially for the first couple months I kept relapsing every 2 3 days despite going to meetings  eventually I began feeling a strong sense of connection and acceptance there that I feel have helped me stay off games  Other forms of support can be medical support from a doctor  therapy  having a strong social network in real life especially if there is an understanding person you can share your struggles with   4  Hobbies  Initially I felt a void as the gaming was gone which until then had given me a sense of purpose and ego  I filled up my free time with things I have always wanted to do  I started weightlifting again  cooking and eating healthy  practising piano everyday  meditating everyday  reading books etc  My new years resolution is to become more social  smile and talk more  How cool that you got ahead of this thing so young   It took me  ahem  a bit longer to come to my so called senses   Not drinking today  I would love that  But please  don't judge me  You can do it  I believe in you  I won't drink with you today  If I had guessed at how good my life would get  from me getting sober  I would have sold myself short    Don't get me wrong  there has been plenty of terrible crap during this journey  yet the good outweighed it   The simple fact is that I haven't had to drink to "cope" with anything  good or bad  in quite a few days    That is a miracle for a drunk like me    Even through the past week    I was home for Christmas  it was good  for the most part    My bride had noticed that our dog had been acting weird lately  we took her to the vet last Monday  Found out our little buddy has lymphoma    Not good  she is going to die soon    Really devastating     The guys on my job had a party on my jobsite Monday  I got back to a mess  as well as beer bottles all over my job  I was livid     My aunt died on Thursday  the last of the generation of my Mom's family     People in the hotel I am staying in threw a huge party last night  it really sucked  the were drunk and rude   Also  it's cold up in Nebraska  cold makes my reconstructed leg bones hurt really fierce   It's all about finding a balance for me  and no matter what happens  not drinking over any of it    I often say  be good to you today  you deserve it     That's what I have to do for me every day      Through it all I won't drink with you today    Exactly   This post is not a lie    Kratom is certainly not a miracle drug  It can be abused like any other drug    However  you should realize that many addicts have found peace and recovery through the usage of kratom    First of all  it's incredibly cheap online  You can have 1000 grams  about 200 strong doses  for 75  shipped of fantastic kratom    Second of all  the ssri withdrawal thing is entirely theory at this point and we dont' know that much about kratom  It is certainly true that you can withdraw from kratom  However  kratom can not kill you in withdrawals  and most people under 10 grams a day deal with the withdrawals just fine    As you said "my kratom needs grew " That means you didn't make sure your tolerance stayed low  and that means you upped your dosages  And then you stopped taking it and had withdrawals  I hope you can realize that the scenario you lived through does not necessarily apply to everyone    I help run a kratom business  I have spoken to many addicts that helped themselves through kratom  Like any drug  you should taper before jumping off   But at the end of the day kratom CAN seriously alleviate opiate and alcohol withdrawals  and it is far less dangerous than suboxone or methadone    If anyone has any questions about kratom  dosage safety  tolerance maintenance  or where to purchase cheap product  feel free to PM me  It is not a miracle drug  But it can help   Hey man  I appreciate you sharing your experience  I actually have been very resistant to the idea of going on prescription medicines because I had similar experiences in High School   For a while I was performing at a high level and getting straight A's  but then became very manic and compulsive  would end up playing Counter Strike all night and not showing up to school    Been through all sorts of differnet med combos like concerta  adderall  with SSRI's or SNRI's  as well as some anti psychotic mood stabilizers   I haven't taken a stimulant medication  or any Psychiatric drugs for that matter  regularly since I was about 18 or 19 and weaned myself off Anti Depressants   Although  I would use occassionally adderall for somethign like to finish up a paper at the last minute   I'm definitely gonna be approaching this cautiously and ask my doctor to keep the doses as low as possible   I'm not looking for this to be a permanent solution  but hopefully something that will help me develop better habits   I definitely don't think it's something I needed to be on as a kid  but hopefully as an adult I will be able to better handle it     Even then I hope to only be on this combo for a year or two at most   Gonna look into non pharmaceutical treatment options too  like CBT   Although my doctors says CBT will definitely help with depression  there is not much evidence it can do much for ADD   All I know is what i've been doing lately isn't working  and its definitely worth trying something else  I'll just have to be vigilant and make sure that I don't stick with this combo if it's not working for me either  It can feel really scary to say "I'm Rhaen  and I'm an alcoholic" to a group of strangers  I was so scared of being pidgeonholed or judged negatively or any manner of anxious things   but then when everyone tells stories of their struggles  I started to realize that I'm not alone in how I feel or my experience  It was a safe  non judgemental environment for everyone to be vulnerable about how they felt but ultimately grow and become stronger   I've only been twice in two years  and frankly SD has been like a godsend for me  and easier to attend than AA    no driving required  I hope you're able to enjoy yourself and learn what you need to learn about yourself to grow  You can do this and I will not drink with you today   Hi  I found the links shared in  this post  https   www reddit com r stopdrinking comments 5j78rw sunday solutions how i use halts and deads to get   a couple weeks back to be tremendously helpful to me when dealing with strong urges  That and seltzer water  LaCroix's good   I will not drink with you today  Day 18  No motivation    Also very hospitable though  My mate and I were basically vagabonds touring Europe for six months  Couldn't afford hostels or even food rather often  Romanians were cool as fuck  extremely generous people  usually after I told them I was Scottish  not fucking English   You're absolutely right  Thank you  Glad you posted this   Seems the video is posted and removed constantly    Two years ago I read Carr's book and quit  No even one puff  I also watched this video  frequented this sub  and explored Joel's library at why quit  If you care stop treating her like some " sloot " and lock that shit down    Or expect her to fuck around as ANY single person would not just a CA female   Hello  I have heard of some good ones in your area   West Pines  Wheatridge  has meetings including LifeRing   Also if you want to go just a little out of Lakewood  there is LifeRing on Blake St  LoDO    That's a really good group    I've had good luck with LiferingColorado org    I hope that helps   I know some folks in Lakewood but they usually come to Denver  one guys rides his bike     I hope to see you around   It's definitely more beneficial  Just try your hardest to stay away before it becomes an out of control addiction  Please take my word for it  Checking in late but I will not drink today  I guess I forgot to answer what I do   I do what I learned in AA   I talk to people about what is going on  I listen to their advice and try to incorporate it    I was so glad to learn that I don't have to have all the answers and that it's okay to ask people for help   This journey is challenging at times  I am glad I have all of you to share it with me  You kidding   It's been 24 hours and I'm in a funk    Suddenly we "aren't drinking" and"not smoking "  Fuck I hate this bullshit  I mean  yeah   We should  Let's try  But I'm not sure which is worse     I'm going to get healthy without you  or you have to do this with me    Lem's confused    And drinking Gin    I hate juniper berries   Hello and good job reaching out       It seems so scary to quit because we're so used to it   I too felt suicidal towards the end of my drinking career      Now I'm sober  I shudder to think my mind had become so twisted      You don't have to drink today   Your addiction will disagree  but it's wrong   You don't have to drink   And your life will improve when you stop       All the best to you    Please do yourself a favour and quit now  I'm 23 and I wish so badly that I had quit when I was your age  Not only would it have made such a difference to the last 7 years of my life       but it probably would have been a lot easier to quit then  The habit evolves into an addiction gradually and it really gets its hooks into you  Try to quit  If a fap feels necessary here and there  it's not the end of the world    but get porn out of your life  Seriously  Cheers man   Hey Cap'n     The Circus has an ongoing  Performance  in my head     I just choose more and more often to walk past the entrance to the Midway and go about my way on Sober Lane     All the rides and attractions and freak shows are still there at the Circus in my Head   If there are performances  it's to an empty venue   However  I know        one glass of wine  will get the lights flashing  the Barker Calling  the rides running        But  Today I choose not to attend   If today proceeds like yesterday I'll do the same thing tomorrow  Here  here   Or however that cheer of agreement goes   Congrats on the small  meaningful  deliberate  and persistent steps towards creating a better life  It sounds like much has been accomplished in only 11 months  I  too  do not make resolutions  but I do take stock and try to decide the one thing to work one first  After all  I figure I'll live much longer now that I'm sober  and  making decisions with my health in mind    Thank you for being part of this community  I appreciate how you've helped make this a place of refuge and encouragement   That's an awesome insight   For me  it was just the permission to drink at all   Saturday turned into Friday and Saturday  turned into Thursday  Friday  Saturday   the permission stopped 29 days ago  and I've permanently revoked my permission to drink  Huzzah   Happy new year indeed   Love this  Great job  I spent all day yesterday cleaning and getting the house in order  Today  I went on an early morning walk with my husband  cooked a delicious soup and watched movies all day with my youngest son  It's been a great day   Happy for you   Excercise  its gives you a goal to work towards  helps you eat healthy  and makes falling asleep so much easier when you finish a long workout  Go to r fitness if you want some more advice Congrats  1501 DAYS is completely inspiring  Hope to be there in the future  Right now  I'm at two years and one day  without even one puff  All props go to Carr's book        I like that    "It's catching "  That is a great response  Wow you are an inspiration  I won't drink with you today   Got a plan  Seriously I'm awful  Shall PM tomorrow night  This is badass  Sometimes a relapse is what gives you the genuine realization and I'm glad it worked for you  You're an inspiration and I will follow in your footsteps  Keep in touch  Would love to see the progress in your  clear headed life   She fucks around and then cry about it  She complains that she's getting laid all the time  all them attention  She's a fucking sloot  She literally cries about it  As in water coming off her eyes  FUCK HER        she's a CA also I'm sure right now it seems insurmountable  but trust us there is light at the end of the tunnel  We support you  because we know first hand the despair you are feeling right now   Clear mucus is probably a good sign  I noticed I was coughing it up before I quit smoking and within a month or so of quitting it stopped  I think it's a natural reaction to the irritation of smoking but it will probably go away soon  9 days  Way to go  Vent away  I am at day 17  and I have to say that it is going to get better  I know that you are depressed  but we are all here to help you get through it  I found that sending encouraging words to others here has probably helped ME more than anything else  We are all friends  You are one of us  Stay strong  Try helping others here that haven't made it to day 9 yet  You are brave and you are powerful  Your body is in shock  but it will get better  Keep telling yourself that  It gets better   My fianc and I decided to not drink for the entirety of 2017  A large goal right  Well it's not just for out wellbeing  It's also because we have two children and want to be better parents and lastly because the only times we fight are when we are drunk  We have decided 2017 is a make or break year for us  We are both very confident it will be a "make" year  We have problems of drinking to the point where we are too drunk  We can't just drink to have a good time and get a slight buzz we have to overdo it and then bring up all these issues from the past that don't even have anything to do with our lives now  I just want to say hello and I am glad to be here    Then drop her        I fail to see the issue  Elavil doesn't really help  I'm at 25mg and you usually need at leaSt 50mg for sleep  100 or more for mood  And to be honest  a harder wd will serve to keep you away true  I feel like the short duration and easier time with wd in comparison is what keeps me coming back  Since it's like "oh that wasn't too bad  I can handle keep taking it " But I'm trying to find other reasons to keep me away such as having more motivation  appetite and natural happiness  Sounds like you won't have a hard time staying away

gym I'm actually at the bar next door instead " Wonderful   Thank you for sharing  It is absolutely a great time to stop  while you have been doing it for less time and you have more of your life ahead of you  Stopping before it progresses further and takes over more of your life will help you so much in the long run  as well as in the short term   Stopping earlier will only benefit you  Good luck  12 bucks for ramen  Stupid Muricans  And no rape  Sheeeettttttt   Settled  It's a duel     My dad got bored with drinking  so he wasn't one of us  But  mom  may her memory be a blessing  she died due to her alcoholism    There was nothing in the world anyone could do for me when I was deep in my disease  Luckily  I got the 'gift of desperation'  and I got in enough pain to try something different  Unfortunately  my story is similar to most    Like the others have typed  Alanon gives one a lot of strength and tools for our lives when loved ones around us are sick with the diseases of addiction and alcoholism  That's awesome   Keep it going      It absolutely gets easier  Every day will have its challenges  but you're strong  and you can do this  We are here with you  I second La Croix   they usually offer it at work gatherings due to its healthier nature  and I used to pooh pooh it because it's so lightly flavored  After quitting drinking  it weirdly tastes so much better  I bought three cases of three flavors this past week and it's been great   Their cherry lime is super tasty  I won't drink with you today  It will be whatever you think it will be   so if you think it's gonna suck bc you're giving up fun stuff  then it will  But if you think it's gonna be amazing because you're living a healthier  wealthier life  then it will be  Think about it positively  and good luck   Thank you for the definition  I agree with you " Fear Of Missing Out is ridiculous   "   I never really thought of it like that until you explained it the way you did  Thank you for taking the time to answer my question  this will definitely help me if I am ever feeling FOMO  Hope your New Years Day has been a happy one  I mean you just can't imagine it  The whole family was gathered in the living room and I went and fell into the christmas tree  I thought it was fucking hilarious at the time  I still do   Needless to say I got kicked out promptly  Last year my friend fucked a xmas tree  So you OK    That's awesome  I don't mean to sound unappreciative  but I feel kind of robbed for having to move to the states at such a young age  I feel as if I've missed out on so much that living in Europe has to offer  As a young child my dad took me everywhere  I've been to quite alot of countries  but it doesn't really count  I was too little to appreciate them  All of the friends I left behind travel often and are truly living life  I feel so melancholic thinking of my home country  It's not that I don't like the US  but life here is not the same  I feel as if I've lived more in 11 years there than I have in 15 years here  And I matured in America   Issue is I would like to have her  I think she would like me too  we're very similar  That's a good start   One of the factors present in people who recover from addiction is having positive association with non using people   You really need to totally avoid the people  places  and things associated with your using history   It requires some tough decisions but the only way is to completely separate yourself from those situations   I wish you well with this new girl  but if it does not work for some reason  don't let that become an excuse to use    Kratom can be used as an opiate replacement but it is ludicrous to possess the notion that a person needing to consume something everyday to not experience withdrawal symptoms is somehow a solution to the problem of addiction   It can also be used to assist in detoxification if it is then discontinued in use   This is harm reduction far more than it is a treatment for addiction   There is a lot more that could be said on this topic but I am going to leave it at that   It is also suspicious that you're offering to help people purchase it if they PM you  as is another user that replied here whom admitted to being associated with a business   It isn't uncommon for people to come here marketing rehabs and products so please don't take offense  Yep  My plan is to not put myself in situations where I am pressured into drinking  I'm not going to visit any bars or anything and I'm also working on getting the medical help I need for some other health conditions I've been unfortunately suffering from because I haven't been keeping up on treatment  All will be good  it's just going to take some time   Then lock it down    or let her fuck   Fellow Scot here  Well done on handling that situation so well  Weird situation indeed  Yeah it sure is a weird concept  This is my second new year in a row that I entered sober  Great way to start the year   I'm in   And I'm going to go full plastic jacket this week  To make sure that I do not pick for a week I'm going to wear finger cots while reading or watching videos  anytime I'm home and idle    And all the other things I said too  Thus begins the year I spend all summer at the pool  We can do this   I relapsed  Very disappointed in myself   So I've been white knuckling for the past 5 years  out of 6    AA's not for everyone  but I wouldn't be sober today if I didn't have the support of the group and my sponsor when I first got started   Go to one meeting and see how it makes you feel   Then go to another regardless of how the first one made you feel   Listen   Share    In that order    Talk to someone   There is a great life ahead of you  but it's up to you to take the steps required to get there   Good luck  Oh lord  I was sweating bullets going to my first meeting   It's a big step   Congratulations    wow you handled that a lot better than i would have  i probably would have disowned a sibling for that   I relapsed  Very disappointed in myself   Night is young War    She already went to bed    CRY HAVOK    I don't like her fucking around  She had some bad consequences before   Anyway  she's the definition of a slut  If you google it  you'll find the picture of her  Sorry to hear about your struggles   You write "I truly am a vile human being"   I don't believe that   Based on what you share  I suspect you're similar to me in that I realized    Alcohol   Me   Undesired Consequences   I suspect  without alcohol  you're  as you write  "a decent sober guy"  I decided to eliminate alcohol associated consequences from my life  "and they've ONLY known me in sobriety "  You make a point of wanting to emphasize something here   What do you mean exactly by this emphasis if I may ask  I will do my best to phase it out of my life  thanks for the advise Slut slut slut slut   1  1    Welcome   Speaking from my own experience  your last sentence is probably the most helpful thing to internalize when you stop smoking  Also  it gets better even if it doesn't feel like it  Not drinking helps a lot too    Edit  Spelling   Sign me up please  I doubt I'll make it one year  but let's see  Yeah no wonder she fucks dudes other than you     I'd be fishing too  Maybe a couple of those Sober 30 days  or 30 day sober challenge would be helpful    Note  what I describe below was during and after the Vietnam war   Women were not in combat at that time   But many of our nurses who were in Vietnam developed PTSD as did the male soldiers    This was at a time when there was no understanding of or medical psychiatristic help for PTSD victims    I worked for the Department of Veterans Affairs for 21 years   Those burn victims and guys who had lost arms and legs  many times more than one limb  had to develop thick skins   Most of them came to realize other people's reactions say a lot about that person and not them   Some stayed angry and their lives spiraled down but most worked to deal with what they were dealt with courage and did not give up on having good productive lives   Most  of the worst comments were from young kids so they understood it was not meant to hurt but was because they were just young kids   These veterans were really great   Dealing with being seriously disfigured by burns or loss and or loss of limbs gave most a level of mature wisdom that some people without these types of challenges may never achieve   These were young guys with the rest of their lives ahead   The majority of them mentally and emotionally transcended their physical challenges   It was an honor to know them and very humbling   They demonstrated courage at its highest level  Nice job   Getting advise like this will really help me to quit  thank you  I  too  have lost 10 years of my life to alcohol   We can do this   I will not drink with you today  It would help  Removing access to gaming is important for the first few days at least  Other things would be to avoid reading about or watching video game related content  If you feel you are addicted  I am not saying you are  only you can make this call  then you will need to avoid gaming  and gaming related content  for good if you want to avoid relapses  I'm sorry but this just isn't true  at least not for me  Kratom saved my life  As addicts we are all very all or nothing  I understand that  I live that in spades  When I started dieting and losing weight as a fat kid  I went all in  Zero junk food  zero soda  weighed my food  not a single carbohydrate touched my lips  I ended up bulemic  for real  I was about 160lbs with no real muscle mass as a 6'0 6'1 adult male  I wanted to keep losing weight  Any day I would cheat even the slightest I would fall into a deep depression and binge  When I started working out I killed myself  at home and at the gym  I drove myself to puking and migraine headaches  If I missed a workout I fell into a deep depression and stayed on my couch for months  As addicts we are wired to be all or nothing  All  or nothing  And both manifest themselves in different ways  at different times  in varying degrees  I tried that with heroin  I did cold turkey  I did Suboxone  Cold turkey never worked  Suboxone made me feel like a sucker  not to mention very sleepy at times   so I stopped trying  I got worse and worse  Kratom came into my life and I stopped doing heroin  Kratom went out of my life for a few weeks and I didn't continue doing heroin  I don't use kratom everyday  I don't care if I run out  It was as painful as running out of coffee  and both are honestly pretty shitty  If the day comes where the DEA decides to prohibit kratom  so be it  My life isn't run by when or where I'll be getting my next fix anymore  That's how I know kratom truly provided a much softer landing for me and helped me kick this filthy habit      Now excuse me I have my 8 30p gay for pay appointment so I can buy moar kratom  Quitting has also caused me to have issues with my SO    I'm just so irritable without weed    No more numbing emotions I guess  Stay strong and tough it out  and definitely don't cheat  Good luck  we are here for you  Thanks for the good luck  I will do my best to stop it before it becomes a large issue Wow   I hope everything works out for you  Thank You  I made my first one   Sending Kind Words your way  You're not paying attention  I have sex with her  no problem  She has sex with god and the world  after I'm done  I can't see how you view this as NORMAL  cause it's not  Guy or gal Pretty sure the OP is not a seller  but I get your point  Harm reduction is correct  I never took the pills for the "high"  and kratom dies not get me "high"  so I don't feel any craving or desperate need for kratom  I just take it for pain relief  I do not take it to avoid withdrawals  in fact I often forget to take it if my pain levels are low  I'm so sorry   I really hope you find a way to stop doing this to yourself  and find a good place with you and with food   I'm no expert  Hahaha good story  Then tell her YOU want a relationship    Man up  I am on Day 9 also   congratulations to us   I can't say whether it gets better since we are in the same boat  But I feel ya on the mood swings  Do you have anyone  a physical person  you can talk to about all of this  My partner has helped immensely because he knows everything I'm going through and has helped pull me out of the depressive episodes I have been having since quitting   If not  keep venting to us    Well  I'm proud to say that I attended my first meeting  The people seemed easy going and receptive  We read through a section of the book  Emotional Sobriety  which launched a vulnerable and insightful discussion about self centeredness  During most of the meeting  I picked up on a feeling of re centering myself  Not just on my pursuit to quit drinking  but I felt anxieties of other aspects of my life ease as they were brought into perspective  I really appreciate the emphasis placed on God to help us live purposefully in the moment  As alcohol became a larger and larger component of my life  my spiritual journey suffered  I feel this will be excellent in helping me rid of alcohol and perceive my upcoming week with a clearer reference frame on the things that matter    In the last share out of the meeting  someone remarked on the topic of selfishness that they sometimes went  all in  to serve others  leaving themselves frayed and broken  So it was important for this individual to be dutiful about self care  I resonated with this idea  thinking that my lack of self care led to greater consumption of the easy  numbing fix alcohol tantalizes  With my perspective and self care out of wack  I became resentful at the very situation I was serving in  expecting greater appreciation  So that's my messy realization  But there's much hope  I think these meetings will be very good for me to get outside of myself    Thank you for the encouragement  You all rock   D Really is  just nice to enter it clear to set the tone for the rest of the year  I dunno what to do about this situation  I may ask her to just keep him in her room when he's visiting  Making cereal in my pants feels weird with an ex lurking in the corner  Where was the ramen   I'm trying to quit drinking coffee too  So watching almost everyone in the room sip on their coffee bummed me out  But the people were terrific  I was addicted to Benzos for 3 years  tapered it down and made a cold withdrawal at home   b t w  for me it was much easier than Kratom   probably just luck   My raging hate against this crap was probably the most important reason why I never took a pill again      Thanks guys  I actually feel better already   This support is amazing  Thanks man  Feel free to PM me as well if you ever need to talk   you can still jerk it if you'd like    Just not to porn    It will do wonders for your psyche and imagination  Masturbation is healthy and natural  porn is not   Thank you so much for saying this    day 17 seems so far away  Congratulations  I am so happy I found this sub  Or massive panic after a blackout wondering what you did  how you got home and if you still have friends for days afterwards Happy New Year  Last night  I took my mentally disabled brother so our parent's could have a new years to do adult things  They wound up sitting around  not knowing what to do without a child to take care of  amd went to bed early  Lol Parents  man      I made up a bunch of snacks and we settled onto the couch while I tried not to puke or pass out  I'm pregnant  not drunk  but sometimes it feels pretty damn similar     As soon as my SO got home  he took over babysitting and I pulled up a live stream of the NYC ball drop and we celebrated midnight an hour early    All in all  it was a nice quiet evening and I woke up feeling a little better  Happy 2017  Quitting cold turkey  Will try to avoid just about anything game related unless it's a couch party game among friends   Gonna try to make this a permanent change  but shooting for 90 days minimum  Absolutely need to and want to spend my time on other areas of life  college  health  friends  family   Best of luck to you all   No amount of willpower can combat a true addiction  Some things I did was to clear my youtube watch and search histories so gaming related videos don't appear on suggested videos  stopped using laptop and switched to an old ipad  filled up my free time with hobbies so I am not left bored and craving for games  I told my gamer friends that I am quitting gaming for good and to please not talk about anything game related with me Keeping up with real friends  Don't browse the trending or anything  Welcome   There's an "official" check in each day  that usually posts early a m  U S  eastern time    At this link  Is Todays Check in   https   www reddit com r stopdrinking comments 5ldn21 daily checkin for sunday january 1st good or bad      Also  u VictoriaElaine was kind enough to provide a Welcome at this link  Some Helpful Guidelines   https   www reddit com r stopdrinking comments 5lh0we a huge welcome      Glad youre here   detach with love   I don't want to have a relationship with a sloot  goddammit  It's a shame though  she's such fun  Too bad she sloot around so much  I know  One of my boys has been on it for eight years  He said his doctor told him that no one in his county has been on Suboxone as long as him  Fucking crazy    I'm with you  brother   One week in so far  going cold turkey   No relief in sight   I barely have enough energy to type this   Nothing helps  no vitamins  no nothing   I know this will take time   I'm with you all the way   We can do this  My ex was just like that  He would get black out drunk  and say the most horrible things to me or kick me out  then beg for me back the next day  claiming not to remember what he did  I left him  so I don't know how to fix you as we never figured out how to fix him  but when dealing with him  we tried to make sure he ate enough food that night and didn't drink too quickly  ofc that didn't always work out  but it seemed to help  So drink in moderation and eat lots of pizza on binge nites  maybe   Good luck to you tho  dude  And if you are my ex  I hope you've been doing well     That's implied by the "major things" line  I suppose my ham handed attempt at a little self reflective humor didn't come across as such   Bye HotS I got into a massive fight with my boyfriend over some chick spraying her bf with a spray bottle    Like what the actual fuck is wrong with me  He's the only one that knows the extent of my smoking  other than maybe my dealer  and we haven't talked in 2 days now    Congrats on your day 9 as well  Im so happy to have someone who understands what I'm going through  this sub is really great    Good luck  You can do this     After Day 3 all nicotine is expelled from your body and it becomes easier  After 3 12 weeks your brain chemistry rights itself and you lose the mood swings that come with quitting   Lots of people here recommend the Allen Carr book   I've not read it  but it's helped my cousin and a good friend    I use the SmokeFree app  like you  and found it really helpful  especially the paid content   I justified it by rationalising that it costs about the same as half a pack of cigarettes where I am  so went for it   and it really helped   I relied on it a lot more toward the beginning and now rarely check it  but it still helps me feel proud of what I've accomplished   Setting your badge on this subreddit helps too  I've been tempted a couple of times and then thought  "But I'd have to reset my badge   "  It sounds daft  but it works   Tell everyone around you that you are quitting  This also helped me in a moment of weakness when I asked a friend for a cigarette and he persuaded me that I didn't want it  It also means that friends don't invite me now when they go out for a cigarette  removing the temptation for me   On the downside  you have the infamous Smoker's Flu to look forward to   LOADS of water   herbal teas will help with this  Guaifenesin can help as it's an expectorant and will help you cough the nasty stuff up  Similarly  using a sauna or breathing in steam  hot showers baths  can help   Think about when you're most likely to crave a cigarette and plan to do something to subvert it  If you have a plan  you're less likely to cave   For me  it's leaving work  Work has been long and stressful and I've ingrained the habit of sparking up as soon as I'm out of sight of the building  which makes me feel relaxed and less stressed   but all that's happening is that the stress of nicotine withdrawal is relieved  not the stress from the situation  Over time  I've conflated the two   So  I made myself an audio file of a load of vocal exercises to sing instead  which releases endorphins and engages my mind  and I can't physically smoke if I'm doing it   Do you have a cigarette after you finish breakfast  Do 5 minutes of yoga stretches instead  After tea  Go for a 10 minute power walk  When you're bored  Download a load of free games for your phone or take up a hobby that needs your hands  crocheting  painting models  whittling  etc    Take a little time every day to reflect on how much better you feel  Within a day your breathing should be easier  Take a deep breath and let it out slowly  revelling in how much air your lungs can hold   Smell your hands and enjoy them not smelling like an ashtray  Eat a really nice snack and enjoy how much better things taste  Light a candle and enjoy the smell of it that you wouldn't have been able to notice before    Good luck   you can do this   Great tip on the app  We got this   Well done   You are exactly right  u often dont get REM sleep when your high  When I felt like you do now  I went to an AA meeting and spilled my guts  I was so completely desperate that I actually got a sponsor and did all 12 steps  It has worked well so far  This is great to hear   As a fellow parent  it feels great to finally walk out of the fog and be completely present with my littles   sounds like you are feeling the same   Also can I have your job  Geez I would love to just decide one day to hire someone to take over so I could coach     Cheers   COMBATiVE    ARE YOU  COMPLETELY TWISTED ON DRUGS     You  wanted to talk to  me  there     But you banned me so that couldn't happen    What part of this do you not understand  I wouldn't put up with it personally but I guess it depends on how serious the relationship was feelings towards the ex  At least she knows you're not cool with all the shenanigans going on  Lol  to last sentence   sign me up please  It's weird  but even though I mentioned my intention to quit alcohol to friends and Reddit  I still felt I had an out  I felt that I could announce after a month that I accomplished what I set out to do and that would be that  But by going to a meeting  I was forcing myself to consider who I was  alcoholic or not  and whether I was going to do real work about it like so many others in the room  When I've described the situation to friends  I described myself as addicted to alcohol instead of stating that I'm an alcholic  for reasons that I haven't altogether unpacked  Thank you for your perspective   I never thought of doing it that way  I will give it a try Then it's not a CA issue    move on or dont I spoke to a counselor   She recommended meetings   I went and found support  tools  resources and fellowship   I've not looked back  ARE YOU NUTS    You and your buddy can't even make it so we can talk on your subreddit    You guys are like an unfunny bad news bears  The potential friendships were one of the strongest incentives for me attending  I hope I come away with some valuable ones   Welcome   Good to have you with us    Boom Nice  you're past the hardest part definitely  Hey I'm sober in Wisco too  There are lots of us actually  even though it might not feel like it     Yep it is ridiculous but I was actually guilty of this with a friend of mine in the past  I genuinely wanted him to drink with me because I thought he wouldn't have fun without it  I didn't realise that no one needed alcohol to have fun and I also didn't realise he had a drinking problem but looking back it was pretty obvious  We are so conditioned to equate alcohol with fun but it's just not true  The book I suggested covers this in lots of detail  it is interesting to step back and look at alcohol marketing and what it is actually showing compared to the reality  But your SO really needs to support you  My sobriety is the most important thing in my life because without I loose control of my life   You are fine over there  Quit the Bull Shit  Hahahahahahahahahahaaaaaa     ahhahaahahahaaaaa     hahahahahahaha    You two are a joke    Only an idiot would take you seriously at this point    And you mod a medium sized sub    Those poor bastards      That I can agree with  Sorry I sounded too bitter  I'm moving on  it just takes time and a bit of suffering  My Sweet Prince   Placebo makes me cry almost every time  It wasn't serious  but after we stopped seeing each other he would turn up to my shows  hang out with my friends  just generally always turn up to stuff uninvited  When my housemate matched with him on tinder I said don't go there and my main problem is that for the last year he's always been there  and now a month later he's always in my house  Weird bad vibes  Glad you made it  My suggestion is to try to go to a meeting every day if you can  and try a whole bunch of different types out  Some may not resonate  and that's okay  Just seek out the similarities in your story with whatever you hear  and eventually you will feel more comfortable  When I was early in recovery  if I didn't feel like talking  I would go to an open talk and just listen   it takes the pressure off a bit  But meetings where you get to share and talk specifically about the steps  the big book  etc  are also great   Yes  It was the pidgeonholing that put me off  I'm more things than an alcoholic  But that is my label  my introduction  in that moment that I had to  and have to  accept  This makes sense to me  At five days sober you have pretty good insight  It's scary  Even after all these 24hrs  I remember the fear  I was desperate  So desperate that it made me willing to do anything to get well  I was lucky  One day at a time  more will be revealed   Be careful with the party especially within the initial 90 days  Take initiative to organize activities with your friends outside of the house as much as you can     He fucked the tree  or the tree fucked him   And this is the probelm witb people  I said for me  myself it doesnt cause WDs and I was posting to help others as it can be used to get off the hard stuff and when stopped the issues if any are no where near as bad  But I'm not going to argue with you because I feel you're one of those types who swears weed is bad but methadone  subs  cigs  and coffee are perfect  Do some reading  kratom is in the same family as coffee     An I bet AA NA or some other meetings are the only way right     I'm not offering to gets people's info I'm willing to show them a public list that's updated daily of well known respected vendors who are actually real companies not some dude on Craigslist   Banned from modmail for being combative  Unbanned now so you can talk to me there on the subreddit on my post  Not through modmail  Thank you so much for sharing this  I'm at day 2 and reading this really helps  Thank you   When I drink  I indulge my self centeredness     Alcohol fuels my self indulgence and selfish tendencies     When I was having a "few" glasses of wine every night  I may have been physically in the same room with my family  however  I was  not truly present        I was  Impaired    In effect I was  stealing  from my loved ones   What do you want for yourself  You'll live     Don't disrespect broads in the process     " CA is full of women  " I'm confused on the fight topic   you are mad at him because a girl sprayed her boyfriend    Regardless  that sounds tough   I can't imagine having a drawn out argument right now with my partner on top of trying to quit smoking   I can see why you are so stressed out       What works for me is going to AA meetings 3 4 times per week  fighting through my fear of public speaking to tell me story at said meetings  having a sponsor  and hanging out with people like me   You can do it   Sign me up sir  here's to January and beyond  Day 2 here too and hungover AF  The worst is over and you will start feeling better soon  Hang in there  you're not alone  He fucked the tree  The guy is mad  I have been banned from bars for shit he has done  "You know xxxxxxx  Sorry  You can't come in "  Agreed  Going Cold Turkey  I'm currently at almost my first 24 hours without a cig  Cravings aren't too unbearable yet   I have relapsed my whole life  Sometimes I'd go 2 months  4 months  5 months  etc   but a relapse always occurred  Why  The biggest factor was personal influence   Someone once told me "You are defined by the people you associate yourself with"  and I think that has stuck in my mind the hardest  When you have a gaming addiction  your main circle of friends will be gamers  When you try and dispose of gaming  but not of your friends  a relapse is all but eminent   The last time I relapsed  I was gaming free for about 4 months  I went on Skype with some of my old gaming friends to see how they were doing  and they were all playing Hearthstone  which was a game I played all day every day  They told me about a new card that came out which was meta defining  and being somewhat interested in seeing it's ability  they showed me some decklists and it instantly brought back all the feelings of gaming I've tried my hardest to stay away from  I thought it would have absolutely no effect on me  but later that night I found myself falling asleep to a few Hearthstone streams on Twitch  The following week I had Hearthstone  Heroes Of The Storm  Overwatch  and Rocket League all re downloaded on my computer  and then proceeded to play games for 10  hours a day for the next 3 months   This time around I have told my friends that I can no longer participate in the topics of gaming  and that I need to spend the next several months getting my life back together  I have blocked all sorts of websites  and cleared my Youtube account of any gaming recommended videos  Welcome    and happy new year to you  too    This is a good place to be  Glad you're here with us  I will join you in not drinking today  I apologize  I'm drunk  you know  What a great day  And the cake sounds delicious  Happy New Year and anniversary  and bday to your husband   Lots to celebrate  Maybe he's been shooting placebos  That's why the sugar wouldn't dissolve     Do you really gotta downvote me  C'mon grow up  Thank you very much  I'm glad  glad is not really the right word  that this resonated  There's comfort I think in feeling understood  and makes it not as lonely of an experience  Feel free to PM me if you ever want to talk     Don't care   no reason for it    I'm not hate'in on all these CA men living in their mama's basements trying to holla    Free love  I realize it seems impossible right now   Please know that many  many of us have been exactly where you are   You can change things   You will want to change things if you give yourself a chance   My advice would be to go to the ER  Ah  props to you for giving up the coffee  too   I've heard great things about giving up caffeine  nicotine   or drinking all at once   I admire your strength and am glad to hear you enjoyed the company at the meeting     It can definitely feel like a label  but it might help to come conceptualize it as a common reason you're there  helping yourself and helping others in community  It also helped me really see that for myself  this is a problem which I needed to get under control   In talking about here at CA genius   And swearing and threats  Damn so sad  The first day is the worst  you should feel like you are hanging on by the skin on your teeth   side note that is the strangest phrase    Your body's homeostasis has included constant weed for how many years  Now you just take it away from it   so every neuron in your reward center is probably screaming at you to bring the good stuff back  Just recognize that your brain is LYING  and try to distract yourself until tomorrow   Also don't worry about Day 3  Day 4 etc  The fastest way to make yourself want to smoke is to tell yourself you can't smoke for the rest of your life    that sounds impossible right  Makes you want to throw in the towel  So just breathe and tell yourself you only are going to abstain for today   Worry about tomorrow  later   Much love to you  You can do it   You're a joke    Fuck off    Start with today  Go to a meeting  probably tomorrow at this time   It all starts with the desire to stop  You've already got that part  Hugs  This was something that took me a LONG time to realize  Way too long  Extracts are way to expensive  kills tolerance  and to me defeat the whole purpose of choosing kratom  Sure it may have very mild WDs but they are not even close to what opiate WDs are but some like me don't have any WDs or they are so minor I don't even notice them because I've had opiate WDs so many times  I was also amazed at how much it helped with pain and that's the main reason I take it now  I initially had no plan to use it for pain either  You didn't know wnat you were doing then  chief  you banned me from posting on your entire shitty site    Moron  By day 22 I woke up feeling a shit load better  It was like a switch went off and it's been a steady increase everyday since  Been on this shit so long forgot what "normal" even feels like  Keep grinding bro  you'll hit the 30 day mark before you know  Whenever you get a craving  try and remember that it will soon pass  Good luck  Most of what I do is book keeping  I own a few retail stores in some smaller towns with no competition  Before I started smoking I actually strived towards goals   created something  Thank God I did that before smoking  bc once I started all the motivation went away  Hired employees and walked away to stay at home to do my books and smoke  It's not a life for me  I've always inspired to make a difference  Smoking made me content   Awesome  thanks for the suggestions  I've heard good things about them before   Over 12 years here    just stopped     it's going to suck    but it's for the better good right  3 Either way  it sounds painful      Reminds me of someone here using a toilet brush one time  I'm sure no one can guess who    Hey baby  looks like someone wants to whine    Unfortunately  everyone with half a brain no longer takes you seriously     Go fuck yourself    Thanks  I don't drink and this was my last vice  I am at day 15 and feel good  I'm a little spacy  which I didn't expect  Quitting coincided with 2 weeks off work  I go back Tuesday  I believe I will be fine but will continue to read all your posts to stay hooked in  For me it's being thankful I don't black out then wake up staring at a drain in the floor of the county jail   Hiking with the little guy for me  Sober morning started at 6  would have been torture I'd had been up drinking til the wee hours  Happy 2017 Sobernauts  Good job on your first week  I'm on day zero  Not a huge new year's resolution person  but I kind of needed some sort of a 'cue' like turning of the year  to give me a bit of a push  Already being an testy biotch but oh well  Keep up the good work      In a bowl  Do you live in a barn   Ahhh that is messed up   Also weird of your flatmate to go there too given the circumstances  when i was 16 I was a full blown porn addict I was watching porn for hours a day and It took me down some dark roads in my life  see porn is a drug  masturbation is fine and natural people have being doing it since the beginning of mankind  porn however is not natural or realistic  sex isn't like what you see on the screen      Doing the same thing man  You can do it   If you want to stop smoking you can't have "just one today" or else you are still smoking   Or at least that is what I am telling myself  Don't be scared   Everyone is there for the same reasons you are  and you should find that everyone is welcoming and happy to have you there  When I got sober the first time in my twenties I spent a few good years in AA  just know that if you don't click with the first meeting you go to there are tons more for you to check out with different people   they're all a bit different  Don't be scared  and you have nothing to be ashamed of  The people in AA genuinely want to help and are glad to have you there  Have fun    I just turned 31 and had the same realization  From 19 31 I was stoned  I figured why not give a year or a few years sober a try  Thanks man I can't friggin' wait to feel even slightly better   I am determined  He thought it was funny that this girl was spraying her boyfriend with the bottle  and I got pissed at him for being "immature" and thinking that's funny and cute  Totally stupid and illogical  I know   I guess all those emotions I repressed with weed are coming out now  Or maybe it's just a withdrawal symptom  Not excusing my actions but that wouldn't have happened if I was high     wow i could have written this   almost at a year myself   good fucking stuff man  This is how I quit too  Only vaped for the first two weeks and drastically brought the nicotine to 0 and then I threw it away     Congrats on quitting cigarettes  You got this  The freedom you will feel when nothing has control over you anymore is amazing  Good luck   You know before this post and you showing your true colours I thought you might have been cool to be invited to  the place we do not talk about here  Where we do not mention the name  But After this Forget about it  I see why you are not liked now  An angry insecure  nasty drunk  Kratom is not that bad and I can see you're just a troll  I'm sure you're one one of the people who down votes every single thing posted on a certain sub  Did I not say if you buy it at a headshop it's extremely over priced  At the prices online with well known vendors it's very cheap compaired to opiates or the clinic  That's you're own fault if the case but I'd bet money you've never even taken Kratom with this comment or you were taking extracts and if that's the case you're not very bright  I'm sure you're ok with subs or methadone right  Sure there may be very minor WDs in SOME but what you're talking about is from extracts if anything related to kratom  Extracts defeat the purpose of kratom and are for idiots trying to get high off it  Feels good to be on here again  two months in a row  Here's hoping for a porn free 2017  You will feel very happy when you wake up tomorrow morning and you did not smoke today   Give yourself the opportunity to feel that feeling  Wtf loooool  Check in LOL  you're a joke  didn't read your post  D    That's what you get for lying  I love this post and everything you said is right  not today It does get easier but you have to be tough with yourself     especially the first few days   You made a decision to be successful in 2017   I have an inkling that if You cave in to your excuses to smoke  You might feel that You let Yourself down   I am only at the tail end of my first week off weed and it is already much easier to abstain   I give myself permission to eat anything I want or buy anything I want or basically do anything I want except no smoking weed   I start looking after myself really well   I be very kind to myself   I know all about the excuses and reasons the addicted mind comes up with to pick up the weed again   That is all they are excuses from the addicted part of your brain   Hang onto the logical part of your brain        the one that says You want 2017 to be a success   Picture the addicted part of your brain as an ugly little weasel whispering in Your ear   Don't listen to him   He is one sick little beastie   As Your clean days accumulate  the abstaining becomes much easier   You can do this   I have smoked for 30   years wake n bake daily style of the highest grade   This is the second time I have quit   I picked up again because of the death of my partner but I am getting back on my feet and I want to be a success too   Keep Strong  It does get easier but you have to be tough with yourself     especially the first few days   You made a decision to be successful in 2017   I have an inkling that if You cave in to your excuses to smoke  You might feel that You let Yourself down   I am only at the tail end of my first week off weed and it is already much easier to abstain   I give myself permission to eat anything I want or buy anything I

but I am getting back on my feet and I want to be a success too   Keep Strong  Tsk Tsk  Those pale blue eyes are getting red  Careful  Check in  Isn't it the best feeling  To enjoy life and remember it  Great job  thanks   7 years 4 months since last drink  hiked this morning  100 push ups  feels good man   Yea at this point being totally sober feels "exciting" because being messed up has become my norm     Well done guys good effort    Sending encouragement   My mind obsesses about that which has not occurred  and indeed may  not  occur   There's an apt acronym   FEAR is my mind believing that   F  uture   E  vents   A  re   R  eal   My first meeting   I was made to feel welcome     I often go to meetings when I travel   I find the meeting address  arrive a little early and just say to the first person I see "I'm new here  how does it work "  There are no "requirements"   You don't even have to talk except possibly "I'd just like to listen"     You are of course invited to share as little or as much as you desire   I find fellowship  tools  resources and support   I've made some of my best sober friends at meetings     I hope to hear about your experience  That's awesome  The sooner the better  I don't miss reading texts I barely remember sending or knowing I was mad when I woke up but not remembering why I was mad  Nope  don't miss it at all   I dunno    she sounds pretty awesome to me When I was 25 like yourself I too was convinced that I had a special kind of alcoholism  that mine was the high functioning kind and that I would continue along with drinking a six pack of strong IPAs every night for the rest of my life  What I learned myself  and what I've seen in others since getting sober about two years ago at 29  is that "high functioning" is not a type of alcoholism  rather it is a stage of alcoholism and for some it lasts a bit longer than it does in others  I juggled a lot of things with a good amount of success until one day it was all too much  Alcoholism is a progressive illness  it is simple physiology that our bodies will require more and more of a substance to achieve the desired effect as time passes and tolerance continues to build  Nobody is immune from this unfortunately    Some are able to stop before it gets really bad  I had to experience it myself to be convinced that I absolutely had to stop drinking if I wanted to have a happy  successful life  Are you convinced that you need to stop drinking in order to achieve your goals   Feel more alive and more present  in conversations I find it easier to express my thoughts etc  and engage with strangers more like at the shops or in public just you know passing comments where I would usually just think 'I should say x' and actually do nothing  now I say it  A bit more confidence and pride in who I am instead of feeling guilty  I had no idea I would get so many replies on this  Every single one of these replies has touched my heart and meant a lot to me and I feel grateful to know that many other people understand what I'm going through  If you guys can get through this  so can I  You're allowed to now   Congrats on finally making the decision to quit  As far as spending money goes  I feel you there    I've emptied my bank account on weed more than once    I'm 9 days sober and looking back on how much money I wasted makes me feel sicker than the withdrawal does   Tomorrow when you wake up and don't smoke  your day won't be foggy  You'll have a clear memory of the morning  afternoon and night  Stay strong  it's going to be worth it  It worked both ways for me   The anxiety and depression made me some uncomfortable that I wanted to drink to numb the pain   But the residual alcohol anxiety and other mental physical symptoms of drinking too much made me so miserable that I finally became motivated to quit   I have thought before that it's like the dentist for me   I have weak teeth and am afraid of the dentist so I generally delay cleanings check ups  but once I had an infected root   The pain was so intense  I couldn't get there fast enough to do whatever it took to alleviate the issue  just like I couldn't bear the misery I felt after drinking anymore  Sure  It will gonna cost you some money  It's not cheap to dial to Brazil  Good luck coming here and fucking one of our underaged prostitutes  You'll get a bullet in your forehead  in the process  most likely  You may want to switch to ibuprofen which isn't as gnarly on your liver  Dandelion tea or apple cider vinegar are good for liver assistance  Good luck to you  I'm hoping to make the change soon  That I had a pattern of choosing the wrong friends  I bet you wish you were back in the sub you're fucking up as a mod  then you could ban big  bad ole me for calling you on your bullshit    But here little baby you can just cry  cry  cry   Waaaaah  You sound exactly like me  I also own my own business  worked at home and at the end was smoking 3 5g's a day of the best stuff you can get every hour a huge bowl through the most expensive bong you can buy in my area  illegal state   Day 7 here  Day 1 6 was rough  finally had a good day today    I believe in you man  I'm certain with all you have accomplished that this will be just another celebratory accomplishment  Hang in there and holler at me if you need someone to talk you out of smoking or if you need to talk  Just have the mindset to do whatever it takes    You got this   If quitting during your normal routine is too difficult   you might consider changing your routine for this change  It sounds like that is what you did with your Europe trip   I found it impossible to just quit in the middle of the work week and keep on my routine because of all those regular times I was smoking  e g  before class  while preparing food  etc  so I used time away from home to get the first few days under my belt   Regardless   good luck  Good work   Will def check out that loseit pge  Cheers  Youre a fucking joke  you dumb fuck eat a dick  We have to heat our dope why  Because you saw it in a movie once  Shit for brains  I won't drink with you  too   I'm grateful for this sub  for my sobriety    for online non drinking buddies like you  too     New clarity in my view of life  greater respect for women  Motherfucker have you ever made Kool aid  Did you fucking heat it up  I bet your dumb ass did  sending love and support your way  find an AA meeting near you and hang out with the people   they all know exactly what youre going through  I don't really have any advice  just my experience   I was a daily drinker for many many years and managed to raise a family  make it through medical school  residency  and begin practicing medicine successfully   Then as life became more taxing and feelings or fear  guilt and shame piled up I drank more and more to cover those things up   I was still functional   But then it progressed to interfering with the professional and family life all while I was in complete denial   The day I lost my job I still denied I had a problem   And the thought of never drinking again terrified me   For me this disease was progressive   It never got better  only worse with time   And my attempts to quit on my own failed   It was only with admitting my problem and accepting outside help that I began to heal physically and emotionally   I've a ways to go but I feel a hell of a lot better than I did one year ago   I wish you the best  You are not a prick  you are human  We are all in the same boat  and know exactly what it's like to allow addiction to let you down over and over again  Last time I went to my dealer I said "I think this is the last time I'll re up" and he laughed and said "how long ya been saying that now " While that was just a small comment  it hit hard  You have to really decide to quit  and you can  Stay strong friend  we are all here for you   Edit  as far as the anti depressants go  you can get something over the counter called Sam E  in the US it is OTC   It helps me more than actual prescription antidepressants did  and no dr visit required   Yeah man you can do it have some faith  In your post read a lot about how alcohol does not  harm  your life    How does alcohol   enhance   your life    I never suffered any tangible consequences of daily drinking  Having lived sober for awhile  I am able to see what alcohol was sneakily keeping me from   true enjoyment  peace  rest  meaningful interactions with loved ones  no matter the time of day   and money  my hobbies are way more fun and less a guilty pleasure these days    I haven't stopped drinking  forever   I have decided  not to drunk    today      Have you considered 30 60 90 days without alcohol just to see what abstinence looks and feels like for you  Ultimately only you can decide if some  a little  or no alcohol is the right choice for you   The name of the place  fuckface   Oh shit  I read your little story    Whoops    What makes you think I'd want to be in a group with a little bitch like yourself     BWAHAHAHAAHHAA    Dummy  Your vagina  you are doing it wrong   I've never heard of the BBA way either  but I can share that working on the fourth step can kind of suck any way you do it  Think about it   you are writing down all of these resentments and bad things you've done  and short of seeing some patterns  you aren't at a point where you're seeing the upside to doing this  But the freedom that comes with completing the FIFTH step   it can only come from taking that moral inventory in the fourth  Actively working on the fourth  it's a matter of putting one foot in front of the other and doing the work to get through it  It doesn't need to be perfect  nothing does   but it needs to be done   Going to meetings and talking about it helps a lot because most people I've met have struggled in the fourth step  Never forget that it is just one of the twelve   you won't be in that mental place forever  I keep feeling like that that I have repressed all this emotion over my time smoking that now I can't deal with shit because usually I would be high and I wouldn't really give a shit  I'm trying to turn my life around but everytime I try to quit u always smoke again then I feel shit for it but still end up smoking again  I don't know how to escape this cycle  well done for day 9  that's fucking impossible at this point  Here's to attempting day 1 tomorrow morning When I was in college I had a brief moment of clarity and was able to see that alcohol and drugs were probably decreasing my quality of life rather than enhancing it  But my grades were good and I was achieving all my goals  so I did not see sufficient reason to change  I did things my way for the next 17 years   got married  had kids and was tremendously successful in my profession  But my overall enjoyment of life was steadily decreasing all the while  Everything that was truly worthwhile became just another obstacle to be endured until the next time I could get drunk or high  I had everything I was supposed to want  but at the end  I found myself driving through an ice storm  looking for a good bridge to drive off so I could finally end the pain  I decided in that moment that maybe I had a disease that I hadn't treated  so I reached out for help  That was 16 years ago  Today  I can say unequivocally that I would not trade my worst day sober for my best day drinking  There is so much profound yet subtle beauty in this world that I could never appreciate during all those years I was chasing the perfect buzz  For me  the best chemical euphoria is just a cheap imitation of the genuine joy that now get to feel on a regular basis  Yes  sometimes I may be less outgoing than I was while drunk  but I am always more present and more authentic  and I'm not willing to give that up today  yeah you made the right move coming over here  Porn is the problem not masturbation  people have being fapping since the beginning of time without any sexual problems but when high speed porn came it became like a drug for a lot of people including myself I could spend hours every day and multiple orgasms on a screen and then fetishes started forming and I went through a dark time in my life and that was because of PORN not fapping  nofap is just as unrealistic as porn with people talking about how there never going to fap again thats just setting urself up for a fall  goodluck mate I hope everthing works out for you Thank you  Hahaha you dont even know what Im talking about  Come talk to me in a year when you have put your time in here at CA  Im the baby just because I can find words that dont involve swearing  I hope that maybe you are really loaded and read up on this tomrw and think man I fucked up bad  But then again you already proven you cant admit when wrong  New goal   no nuts in tissues 2017  Record currently 1 1  New slogan     No more fiends in 2017     Edit   slogan might be changed to   Less fiends in 2017    What do you guys thinks  That was my original plan with leaving  I came back   went "oooooo weed" and that was it   I run my own business so I'm trying to vary up my routine to help  Wake up  make breakfast  hit the gym  actually go out and work at a coffee shop    instead of    just sitting at my computer  That is wonderful  I think treating yourself with fancy sodas is an excellent way to celebrate the victory  Ice cream was my go to celebratory indulgence  especially in the early days  Oh baby  I'll wipe your tears away    You little bitch lol  Ohh gotcha     well I could see myself  in the right mood  reacting the same    Just blame it on the withdrawal  The silver lining in all this is that is a good fucking excuse for over reacting lol   LifeRing is another secular group  Good luck  I can relate  I have no real answer  But it would seem that you are bothered by your drinking or you would have never ended up here  Feel lucky that you are having this realization now when you can make a change  Many people never get that opportunity   that's nearly the only place I go  but there are like 400 meetings a week here  Let me know what part of town youre in when you come back again and I'll suggest some   I like that  But I bet he tried to smoke it  The fact he gets no H and is all sugar is my fault  WTF  HAHA   Now that's the kind of thing a clueless looser might say   Thanks so much man  Ya that is me exactly     I think ever since I started buying from a dispensary the weed has been too good     you can really feel it    and thats when it started going downhill   I'll keep in touch  Congrats on hitting day 7  Thats awesome  Hahahah My reasons    1  My physical health  In 2014 I was the lightest I'd been since 12 13 years old  180lbs  scary right    I've gained 50 lbs of that back  Alcohol ruined my sleep and caused me intestinal problems   not to mention going to the ER for an ulcer last June    2  My mental health  I had had long standing anxiety and depression issues and drinking certainly made that so much worse  Hungover anxiety at work hurting my performance  something I take huge pride in   being upset at losing my memory  being upset that I crashed early when friends were over   anxious that those around me could smell the alcohol on me  anxiety that I'd say something horrible and unreal to those I care about  Anxiety about not knowing what went on the night before   3  Social health  Never risking driving under the influence  Never making an ass of myself  Not being seen as the drunkard  When my friends have played card games   The Voting Game   even a month into sobriety I still win the cards voting along the lines of someone with an alcohol problem  It's eye opening to realize that's how my friends see me  It hurts but I need to see it as another reason to eradicate alcohol from my life   4  Breaking the genetic trend  My mom's mother drank herself to death  Mom told me stories of hiding alcohol around the house trained tank of the toilet  under the couch  in her bed  behind her bed  Fortunately my mom avoided alcoholism  despite being married to an alcoholic  My dad is in work release right now for a DUI  It's his second or third  Eight years ago in February we had an intervention for his weed and alcohol use  and he said he'd get better and go to classes AA and maybe it did help  for a short while  I know that even while he gave me the two and three year AA chips he wasn't being honest in his sobriety  Now multiple DUIs later  he says he's going to change  I want to trust but he needs to prove that he's helping himself   5  Being honest with myself and others  Like above  it means nothing if I told my amazing husband that I'd stop drinking  and not stop  or drink behind his back as I had in the past  Doing that was lying to myself  and worse  lying to my soul mate  I still can't believe the things that I've done and said to the person who is most deserving of my honesty and respect  He'll be going on trips away this month  and it would be the easy  but wrong road to drink while he's gone  It would be dishonest to him  and dishonest to myself  To grow and be the person I want to be I have to be honest  I will not drink today  nor any day again   6  There is no moderation for me  When I drank  there was no one or two  I'd like to myself and others saying that's all I wanted  But it would always become more  The rabid animal inside would just keep craving more and more until before I knew it I was waking up the next day  no idea what happened the night before  When my husband would say  okay  just weekends  it could never be just weekends  or just wine with dinner  It always had to be more  And that destroyed me inside and outside  Any permission is opening the door to me hurting myself and everyone I love   7  The best for last  my partner  My partner came from an abusive relationship  I vowed to be an awesome husband and show him what a better life could be like  I sure failed that in many occasions  I'm blessed to have someone who loves me  is willing to help me and be there for me  Someone who can hear me promise that I'd never do it again  and when I failed and did it again was willing to still stand by me and let me prove that that was the last time I'd hurt us both by drinking  That last time was 29 days ago  and I've never felt more confidence in myself that I'm done with alcohol for good  For myself  but also for the amazing fella who's willing to love me    I will not reset my badge  I will not be dishonest with myself or my loved ones  and I'm going to start respecting myself and my amazing spouse  I will not drink today   Edit for formatting cus I'm 100  mobile  I can't wait to hear the progress that comes with you giving up smoking   It is impressive that you kept everything together while smoking so much   so it'll be sweet to see your capabilities with a clear mind   You're as credible as timbf now    Lolol     Nobody with half a brain is going to take you kids seriously now  Ya man  if I had  50 and no food  I was more likely to buy  40 worth of weed and keep the  10 for more weed the next day  I laugh sometimes about "oh man it would be nice to buy x" and then I think "wow if I didn't smoke for a week I could buy it"   But then I would just go buy more  Vicious cycle  don't worry and don't let it get you down finish off 2017 pornfree  Not smoking causes us weed addicts anxiety   It is important to deal effectively with the anxiety   Your Dr can give you medical assistance or you can go the herbal route to help take the edge off   A mad33 gave excellent advice in cutting back  for awhile before you quit   It will make the withdrawals easier to handle   I would definitely use the 2 weeks your friend is on holidays as the time to cut back and quit   Get a wee bit of clean time under Your belt before subjecting your partner to the angst we all go through in dealing with withdrawals   We can do this  GREAT quote  My theme for this year is "do less  finish more " I am always overestimating what I can get done  and consequently have many unfinished projects and goals not reached  Time to make those incremental changes  Fantastic job on 2016  I really enjoy your posts  Thank you for your thoughts my fellow long winded pal  D Welcome  Facing reality is very difficult but it wasn't getting any better when you tried to escape it    I'll be two years sober in march and it continues to be the best decision I've ever made I wouldn't throw your lot in with those retards   We know how to make kool aid    If you wanna be a timbf fucktard  well  don't say I didn't warn you  I have had plenty of weird things in my vagina but not that    Yet    Congrats man  Keep the streak alive     No more fiends in 2017   Congratulations  I'm 26  so I can relate to your thoughts on your age  I'm so happy for you  Aww  guess timbf has a bitch after all    Assume the position  Isn't it great   I especially enjoy the added energy and general sense of peacefulness that sobriety is graciously giving to me   I've heard people ask  "What do you do for fun if you don't drink "  That always makes me smile   What don't I do for fun these days   I've rediscovered old hobbies  exercised more frequently  spent a lot more time with my family    just generally recovered my old zest for life   Wasted  hungover me wasn't doing any of these things  Congrats on your sobriety   I'll happily not drink with you tonight to celebrate the new year  Hello and Welcome  I've been where you're at I don't know what it is but when I would start drinking excessive the mental obsession of getting booze in me would trump everything  I started practicing a lot of lip service  Calling into work  making a lot of excuses and just being a rotten person  That is my experience  the muscle pain I've been told was from my lack of potassium  I used to get cramps really bad it hurt like hell  So alcohol wrecked me in so many ways and nearly cost my life a few times  This last time I fell off the physical pain from withdrawal became so bad and I couldn't stop on my own I had to go and detox and be under supervision  I just turned 37  I started drinking really heavy at 22  I don't regret what I went through it has led up to where I am today  I hope you find peace and there is a lot of help out there   Sleep will come  Music  good documentaries  etc  always kept me in a decent mood late night     No more fiends in 2017   Original post was deleted  buuut  may I ask why you say you feel like a dick drinking a soft drink in a bar  I'm sorry you have to hear lectures on moderation  I suppose I'm lucky that my friends understand wholly and support not drinking  Do folks you talk to not understand that for many  there isn't moderation  That it goes a lot further for us      Sorry  friend  I won't drink with you today  You are young  There is still time    Speaking of vaginas  I need to go shower and then go do important things   Dude you argued with not 1 two 2 not fucking 3 but 4 IV users now  AND NUMBER 3 was a fuckin biochem major     Youre a dumbass  You where saying fash was wasting so much    The only person wasting their drugs here was you heating that shit up and fucking up the potency  The only thing you dissolved by adding heat was filler     Sush sweetie  the adults are talking  It gets easier and easier  Keep strong  Keep focused  If you can be around loved ones who support your decision  If you can't  keep your mind occupied through reddit  movies  music  etc    Good luck  You have our support   Hahah He is busy with me right now  Go away  lol Yeah on second thought  I'll probably be avoiding that one haha  Thanks for the advice I can relate to just showering and having a vagina  but no important things     Bang out some pushups  You doing meetings     No more fiends in 2017   You can do it      There is hope  Right here   So far as I can tell more than ten folks who started a year ago have reported their success on SD in the last day  This is huge     This is exactly how I feel but I still don't know how to ditch the bud Thanks for your story   I remember your Sunday Share when you posted it   Awesome   The 'glass of scotch' is something                Same  it's a vicious cycle for sure  It's really scary  I just made a promise to myself that I would go to 3 meetings a week for all of January and will tell my therapist so she can keep me accountable  I don't have to share with the group  I just have to show up  This has nothing to do with tim dude youre a fucking dumbass idiot  everyone youve come into contact has told you that you are wrong  But it's ok Everyone else is wrong  the subreddit full of lifelong junkies are wrong     You are right  Yep forrrsure  I just came to see what was up and then I see it's just some fuckhead who refuses to admit hes a fucking idiot and then turns around calling everyone else names and telling them how right he is      Ohhhhh  I know the feeling all too well   Some people like fruit  especially bananas for the potassium   Small bites   Chew it up well   Lots of water   I like sparkling water   It helps  Also  I found that soups are easier to get down than solid food   Sorry  I don't know of any supplements that will help   I did read that probiotics help some people    There's no explaining to this dude  jesus fucking christ  Im running away lol I'm sorry  That sounds so hard  Thanks  I also forgot to add that I have my girlfriend with me as a strong support system  so that's great  I took about 3gs earlier to see how it would affect me  and it was just fine  I've had some periods of "weirdness" today along with my withdrawals  but I really think it's all just kratom withdrawals and side effects  I'll be tapering down to nothing within probably about a week  only because I don't want to quit cold turkey with all these weird withdrawal symptoms already a problem  Thanks again guys for the support  I'm pretty educated when it comes to all this  but I've just never heard of anyone having such severe symptoms when taking such relatively low moderate doses   Welcome  friend   Glad you are here   Staying sober has been the best gift that I have ever given myself   I'll gladly not drink with you today if that helps     It never happened to me  but I did have friends in grad school who described something like this  That said  it's probably best to go to a doctor if you're barfing when you eat  They'll have a much better idea of what could be plaguing your digestive system  Good for you  I'm also around  the same sober time  I just got out of treatment before Christmas and haven't been to any meetings also  I feel like I'm doing really well and that I don't need to go  I heard the 90 meeting in 90 days is really good to do  Maybe this is a good goal to set  For you and myself I also had a lot of pie  I don't even feel guilty    Your boy has already assumed a submissive position   https   www reddit com r cripplingalcoholism comments 5lfjw4 how to make a margarita dbvzcxc      Happy New Year to you as well   u seanomenon     Feeling grateful today  I have spent so many January 1sts in the past nursing atrocious  all day puking hangovers  it's so nice to bring in the new year feeling good  feeling thankful  You helped me out 5 years and 3 months ago now  THANK YOU  Hope this new year brings you happy adventures  peace and joy    3 Thank you man  Heading into day 6  Hoping I get rest tonight  Good shit happened today but the cold has me feeling like ass and cleaning everything behind me  I smoked daily for 20  years    The first three days will be the toughest   You'll likely be irritable and may have difficulty falling asleep      Try some Tylenol PM to help get your sleep patterns back on track   But only for a few days      You may experience a lack of appetite   For me that was good as I had become overweight   I found fruit and Greek yogurt were good and helped keep my energy up     Your dreams will likely go into overdrive after being suppressed for so long   Mine settled down after a few short weeks     Ultimately it felt real good to stop hurting myself    Good Story Telling  I felt like I was there  Happy NY to you also  Here is to a Sober and strong one  I like this perspective quite a bit    Okay  the above reads way cheesier than I intend  but an up vote seems inadequate      So   thanks for sharing  It's helped me to read and think about how I've been interacting with my own circus of late   I have had issues with my appetite the day s  after drinking heavily   I would not eat or could not because I too would bring the food back up   I've only had those experiences after drinking heavily  so I know that my issues were alcohol related  I woke up late but sober  went to lunch with 3 of my best friends  did laundry  went over to another friend's house to visit  watched Seahawks with a good friend and support system  swept my house  did yoga  dyed my hair  answered some messages I'd neglected  and called a friend in WA to wish him happy new year  It was a good day  Tomorrow I will go to work and go to AA  I have hope  which I haven't had since before thanksgiving  Will not drink with you all tonight     This is a terrific quote   Congrats on 473 days of sobriety  I will not drink with you today    Therapist  First time tomorrow  my wife is going with me to learn and try to understand what I'm going through with me  Despite never touching a drug in her life she's remarkably open to wanting to help and understand recovery  This is a seriously nice thread   I almost got married last night   and got proposed to again today   This explains a lot  Haha   What do I do for fun   I remember everything   I have to inventory the resentments I gather so I don't boil over which leads me to drunk  which leads me to jail  broke or even death  This process has helped my stress level tremendously along with meditation   All in a day's work  ya prick  Lots of truth here  Thanks  I have wake and baked daily for almost 20 years  Looking forward to a new chapter in life  Keep your vagina clean  It is what my mother always told me  And that is important  Don't underestimate yourself  I don't   But I definitely can't at 3  I just wanted to know where he ate ramen  Jesus Christ      Happy to say after 11 months clean it didn't even cross my mind    Skin of your teeth is an interesting phrase  this made me laugh  Thank you   Thank you for all your efforts and hard work    I smoked daily as if I needed to fill a void in my life  I waked and baked  smoked before every meal  smoked before bed  I was psychologically   addicted    It gets in the way of my career also  I quit for my health and future  It's not crack  but it was definitely something that I needed to stop depending on daily   Just fuckin with ya  Thank you so much for this   I am exactly the same   and am constantly searching this sub for people with similar experiences    I am a daily smoker  I own my own business and smoke before work every morning  I wake up  smoke and then do a ton of creative thinking  I'm about to start a project that I won a grant to do   ideas and writing that I did stoned  I am writing a novel  and it reads well even when I'm sober   So why am I here   On leaves and not petioles  One day I had the thought   why am I waiting for something terrible to happen  What if I hit someone while driving high  I don't drive totally stoned but definitely while feeling the after effects   Even if I don't get drug tested  I would never know if the weed impaired me  My girlfriend is a teacher and a drug dog barked at her car   I've never stored weed there  it could have been a total mistake   but ill never know  It could have been from me getting in after just smoking  Biggest reason of all is that I want to be a foster parent   and in my state even a small drug conviction will get you banned forever    Or maybe on a less visceral level I am wondering if I am meeting my potential  I've done so much stoned   what am I capable of when I'm sober    I am gearing up to quit on my birthday this January   I'm experimenting with days off  Its hard  I feel uninspired  lazy  angry and disengaged  I'm hoping it passes   I fear that my good ideas  critical thinking and optimism will wash away and I'll become an internet addicted zombie  With a double chin  Which  speaking of which   I could really use some of that loss of appetite that everyone talks about  I spent my day off weed binging on Christmas cookies   Anyway  I hope you keep writing because it really is helpful to hear your perspective  And would love advice on how to acheive the creativity  clarity of thought  emotional reasonace  and motivation that weed can provide without use of the substance  Best of luck  I'm sorry you are hurting  I've been having rough go of things these last few months and not using alcohol to escape has been challenging at times  Every morning  however  I am so glad that I didn't drink  The price of a few minutes an hour of escape just isn't worth the cost  Plus  it won't change the situation or make me feel any different   I guess this is  in part  to say you are not alone  I will not drink with you today   Nice job man   What's your plan  I'm in sign me up  Haha set up the block and wait for me  Pie  That's what was missing from Christmas dinner  Pie    I am totally making apple pie this week and I won't feel guilty about it either     Lol   so true  I'm glad I tapered off before quiting this time around  Finally did something fucking right    Why are you advocating active smoking on an addiction forum   The fundamental definition of addiction is the inability to moderate      99 99 percent of us cannot do what you do   Believe me  we've tried     I'll join you in going to AA tomorrow  Keep up the good work  Please don't  lol  Later gator  I think what frightened me the most about going to AA was the fact I would be making an undeniable statement that I had this disease and taking a concrete step toward sobriety  It made everything very real  And it ultimately saved my life   The people were overall very kind and welcoming to me  I would suggest that you stick with the women  especially at first  Not every man in the rooms can be trusted  Good luck    I don't need an excuse to quit and get rid of my PC  I just need to do it and want the change for myself   100   You are from his subreddit  here to defend him    I admire that  but I already destroyed your master    There isn't a defensible position here    Just doesn't exist  sorry bud     You can name call and be mad all you want but it doesn't change the facts    Grrrrr  right  Thanks    I can't have one either  It's either some or none  I'm choosing none    I'm happy to hear you are feeling great  2017 will be a great year  Drinking nightly from 24 31  I was able to graduate law school  pass the bar  run trials all while staying fit  dating often  purchasing materialistic trivial things  etc    You are your own man  but I warn you  it can catch up to you   I've posted my full story if you care to read it     Good luck and I wish you continued success   I will not drink today   Congrats   Do your best to separate the voices in your head  if you will   There's one that is committed to you  moving forward and getting better     and there's one that wants you dead   Try and remember which one is talking when you're contemplating doing something good for yourself  I like the idea of this subreddit being my sponsor  Thank you for the advice Thank you and good luck  Your little voice's echo is profound    Awesome to hear   Thank you  I've noticed distracting myself helps too  Sometimes if I wait long enough the urge will pass  Best of luck to you  No problem at all  glad to have helped  Glad you are here  sounds like you have support at home which helps  Yes  you can do this  I do it one day at a time and check in every morning and throughout the day   Yeah I have friends who drink more than me and eat like pigs  I don't get it  and it's very frustrating cause I do like food  I noticed the change in my appetite about 2 3 years ago so I was curious if my long going drinking habit was affecting it  Been meaning to see a doctor about it but my insurance isn't so great  drunk chess i like it horse to 3a  I can relate so much to this  Yesterday I tried an edible as well and it was an awful experience  Not to mention all that money wasted  It's kind of a good thing it was a bad experience   another bad habit avoided I suppose   I applaud you for playing that off like the joke of a remark it was  His though was that I had recently slipped binged drinking alone Dec 22 23 24  although I informed all necessary parties in my life and did not lie  Sign me up  Thanks    This would give me anxiety x1000  I commend your confidence   Thank you  I was hesitant to post this as tomorrow is day one   I am not an alcoholic  this I know  But I want to stop the daily couple of beers or couple glasses of wine  And I know I have to because I have gained so much weight because of drinking   The exceptions will be with my BFF as she is moving soon and we have to have our two girls nights before she leaves  Who knows when we will see each other again   Is that alright for this sub or do I have to quit permanently to be here  Habit definition  an acquired behavior pattern regularly followed until it has become almost involuntary   Yep that's what I was doing with alcohol also   New habit these days i'm happy with  5am starts when no one is up  hit the beach and back early hangover free is nice  Right the fact is that fucking heat isnt needed to dissolve sugar or heroin  If you want to dissolve more sugar heroin than you would heat up water and that would increase the fucking solubility       For fucks sake man    And seriously destroyed my master    lmfao who the fuck seriously talks like that lol  Never met you  have no idea who you are  but I'm thinking of you and praying for you  Be strong and know that you are stronger than this  There's a lot of folks here fighting the same battle  You have a pretty terrible attitude   Just because someone disagrees with you is no reason to make a bunch of other assumptions about who they are or fire off personal attacks   Be intellectually honest  what worked for you may not work for others  this is true of just about any method  and just because you didn't have a problem with a substance doesn't mean others won't   You are very excited about something that you feel finally worked for you  and that's great  but there's no reason to get so defensive   Kratom  like other replacement therapies  has had success for some people   Like all mind altering drugs it has also posed a problem for some people as well   It IS addictive and may lead to difficult withdrawals   It CAN also have other side effects  most notably a skin condition effecting the face which results in redness and dry patches similar to eczema   This is well known in Thailand where it's use is old news  having been an herbal remedy for a couple thousand years  and it's a condition that continues after use has stopped  perhaps permanently   Eventually a tolerance will build up  extract or not  that's basic biology   A drug is a drug  it will effect different people differently  and by definition will have side effects  that's how drugs work   While they may not have been an issue for you personally  virulently defending it as a perfect wonder drug just comes off like the potheads that insist weed is a perfectly harmless plant that has never harmed anyone   Taking any psychoactive substance has consequences  sometimes in the balance it is a benefit  sometimes not   Please don't neglect the rest of your recovery program and depend on kratom to magically fix your addiction  nothing can do that  only by working on ourselves can we stay clean long term   Good luck to you  I hope you have a successful recovery  Bottle of wine costs about the same with the same proof   There are parts of me that want to give up the booze  or at least learn to control it somewhat  but there is barely any incentive to do so   What are the reasons you might want to give up or control the booze  Is it just the near certainty of health problems later on  as you mentioned  or are there other reasons    I do have depression and anxiety  both of which I have managed for around 10 years now  Honest question  Was drinking one of the ways you managed that    I can't help but feel it would change the whole dynamic of my life   It is absolutely changing the whole dynamic of my life  some parts of this are challenging right now while other parts  the parts I choose to focus on these days  are wonderful  wonderful changes that make it worth it to me  I have experienced that empty feeling of not feeling quite myself  especially a week ago  but I'm developing a new normal for myself that I like more  I think it'll be a while before I can be around boozy gatherings with lots of people  Christmas was a challenge  so I spent NYE at home  What's working for me right now is taking a break from many things I would normally do  I spend a lot of time on here  which helps with the hours when I don't have other satisfying non drinking activities to distract me   In terms of abuse I inflicted on my body  I got away with a lot more 10 years ago than I do now  I know my drinking made that worse  10 years flew by  and what I wouldn't give to have made the changes I'm making now 10 years ago instead  But at the time  I didn't suffer as much because of it  And so it goes   Thank you for sharing your story with us  I wish you all the best  Thank you  I've looked up meetings so many times and chickened out  I'm really hoping I can get up the nerve tomorrow  It takes time but I promise it is worth it these difficult days are part of it  I've seen people almost fall apart after a year and live to tell about it  They will say that they are so happy that they stuck with it and another year elapses and another year and all the mental garbage and the gloomy days subside and everything is brilliant  I got a sponsor this time around and really started working the steps and not just riding the coat tails of the fellowship of AA  Don't get me wrong the fellowship and meetings are great for some people  but I am introverted so I needed a more personal approach  My sponsor gets me in the book and I work step 10 daily when I start getting out of sorts  This time around is different for me and much more fulfilling spiritually  I am of course more spiritual as well  Having kids would be rad I could definitely get a charge from them   I'm with you   Much simpler  And cheering on all the day 1s  You got this  I have to wait several hours before my stomach will let me eat after I wake up  Even then I still feel like I'm forcing myself to get it down  I should have mentioned I also smoke a pack a day so I know that definitely isn't helping either   Sign me up  the smoking will be fun  I hate smoking sanyhow  it's the drinking it will take some getting used to since it's been my "this makes me enjoy people" medicine for fifteen years  it will kick my climbing game into high gear though so that will make up for it There are people in all stages from complete abstinence to moderation to considering where they fall into the mix  All are welcome  You would be surprised how many people are here just reading   Hoping everything goes well for you  Man  I've been pretty out of the loop as of late  Weren't you like nearly homeless last I checked  Now you're living it up in NYC    Either way  hope this year goes better for you buddy  Actually  better for all of us  Cheers  Wow   I didn't mean to strike such a nerve within you that you would feel compelled to write about what you think I think even though I stated none of those things whatsoever   This sub isn't an appropriate place for you to post personal attacks  if you actively participated in this community you would know that but instead it seems you came here just to advocate for Kratom and you are now becoming angry that people aren't agreeing with you   You went to go as far as to say I am "what is wrong with people "  I would have to disagree with you there  I am advocating for a solution that doesn't require the use of a substance every day to feel well   I am not advocating maintenance of addiction to reduce it to an easily manageable malady but instead to solve it altogether which there are many ways to accomplish just that   I am not in a 12 step fellowship nor do I believe those are the only way   Rather  I consider the disease model of addiction to be the most explanatory which is why I consider things like methadone  suboxone  and kratom to be efficacious harm reducers but not solutions to addiction  Great post   I'm inspired by your story  Welcome    I found r stopdrinking helped me find what I wanted in IRL support  as well and being generally helpful    My binging ended up five days a week and passed out for the weekend  I never thought I was an alcoholic  but I tried 30 days booze free  After about two weeks I started to think 'what next ' The idea of going back to drinking appalling me so I kept going and never looked back    My life is beyond improved  it's simply new   It gets SO much better  You are probably gonna sleep a lot for the first 6 months and that's okay  You've got to be selfish  to an extent  in recovery  especailly in the beginning  I recommend NA and working the program as they tell you  It works  Stick around until the miracle happens     It did feel good  You absolutely can do this  I hope you make the choice to quit  There are several of us that have been in a similar situation  and we're here and we're sober  It's scary  especially at first  I've not gone all that long yet  but just know you're among friends that can relate to you   Cheapest wine around here besides Mad Dog or whatever its called is about  6  And it smells like wine whereas you may be able to hide the 4 loko smell   Thank you  I have to say I have been to an NA celebration  for my brother  and everyone was super super nice there  And I've been to a Naranon meeting as well  I think the most intimidating thing is probably the prospect of actually getting sober  Maybe the fear of meetings is really about that   This    Chronic  Progressive and Fatal   People disagreeing with you doesn't make them a troll  reasonable adults can disagree and not be an ass about it   Such an attitude does create some skepticism about your intentions though  if you were just trying to help people why would you be so defensive   Being honest and reasonable gets much better results  knee jerk run on sentences make it hard to take what you say seriously   Also presenting a solution  and then immediately offering places to buy said solution just looks bad and again is a red flag   Just my  02   Good luck with your recovery   Definitely  Congrats     Thanks for the proof BTW that people like you active addicts  are scared of kratom because you know it works and if used you have no excuse   Wow   I can probably only go to one meeting a week but I also see a therapist who can help fill the gaps hopefully   No headache  No unsettled stomach  No urge to vomit  No exhaustion  I'm not sure why I never tried this before  Again I know the feeling and I'm tired of this cycle   This has actually become a more recent issue for me and I know much more of a sign with MY body telling me "it's time to leave alcohol alone for good "   I don't know David Foster Wallace  but I sure do know Ted  9   I'll need to look up Wallace   Congratulations on your 2 years  Kratom never really worked for me   I found lope was the way to go   Dose first thing in the morning  again in the evening   I could sleep  I could eat   Perhaps I did it wrong with kratom  but for sure lope helped me Drinking heavily was always an appetite suppressant for myself    I would consult a Doctor nonetheless   I could barely walk and stayed in bed for two weeks    Seeing a Dr  won't hurt  we can't give medical advice  can you pull your appointment forward if you need to  Stay off the Internet if you can  Or channel your surfing to r stopdrinking   Don't be surprised if you need to eat sweet foods  There's a bunch of sugar in booze    You're not alone   Thank you for posting this  I don't know about you but by the time I had a few  my 'tracking' would start to decline  I wouldn't be able to remember if I tracked it or not  Happens to me at the track at the gym too  7 laps equals a mile  When I get to higher numbers  I start to think 'Was that lap 10 or 11 ' When I didn't know  I would always go with the lower number  I'm sure I ran way more than I thought  Imagine if I did this with a drinking app  Was that drink 4 or 5  Ah  no idea   I'll make it 4  Eek  My BAC would not be accurate   Either way  you're doing a good thing and I'm not drinking with you today   EXCUSE ME    I know you're grasping for straws here  as you have sunk your own image to hell  BUT YOU WILL NOT TRY AND CAST HOMOPHOBIA ON ME YOU PIECE OF SHIT    I love my gay brethren  and fuck you for trying to turn nothing into an issue you worthless cunt     SHAMEFULL THAT YOU MOD  R OPIATES YOU GODDAMNED TRASH  Honestly  if she's going to do one or the other  Kratom is the way to go  For me personally  I just don't want to be addicted to this stuff anymore  But was I fearful for my life  No  Just sick of feeling crappy  worrying about the potential ban  etc  The one thing you said that worries me a bit though is that she's 'nodding out'  That doesn't happen typically with Kratom  So I'd be concerned maybe there's something else going on  I have gotten really sleepy before from taking too much Kratom  but never nodding    All in all  if she's going to take Heroin  pills or Kratom  I'd say Kratom is her safest bet  Because I'm a drunken mess kept in reserve  Yep  I think you are right on the nose with that  When I really think about it I think I'm most afraid of really taking concrete steps and truly admitting to myself that it's a real problem  Thanks for the tip about the Womens meeting  I sort of had that feeling and I always feel most comfortable in the company of women so that might be best for the first meeting   Lotta people suffering over at   r quittingkratom  It reminds me too much of regular opiate withdrawal   If it's helping you get your life together  and you're okay with knowing there will be discomfort when you stop  then more power to you  So what is your plan of action   Ah  I see  I am pretty sure you live very close to me   Alternatively you could take up running  meditation  journaling  horse riding  yoga  swimming  painting  learn a language  volunteer at a homeless shelter  volunteer anywhere    If you're an alcoholic you shouldn't pick up  if you're not you don't need to pick up   You brought it up like it was a bad thing  Not me  A lot of people like it  So whats your problem  And I always love when they say I got many gay black Mexican friends  Never a  good sign  And enough with the swearing  They are incredibly intimidating for everyone before one attends  I was more nervous entering a meeting than I was a courtroom  more nervous appearing amongst fellow alcoholic than I was colleagues or judges  Just let the meeting know it is your first time and don't feel pressured to share  you can simply sit quiet and listen     The nerves subside quickly  Everyone there has experienced what you have  Everyone there is there for the same reason  You'll see people of all ages  races  sexes  etc   I go to AA as much as often now  I struggle with the religious aspects but that's okay  Trust that you'll be okay   Send her articles on substance abuse and the disease of alcoholism  The only way to get through is by education   I'm able to get up and walk  Hell I worked at the cafe as a waiter ok new years eve  Only thing that was wrong was I felt like I couldn't talk right  "Bread and butter" was coming out " fesh bed and budd" I barely introduced myself to tables cause just saying my name made me sound dumb  Not neccesarily stumbling on my feet  but my words  No one understands what I'm saying anymore I have to repeat everything  Is this normal  Oh  I know what that's like  I don't think about not drinking ever again  I can't  Maybe I'll be able to envision that or say that's my intention down the road  but if I dwell too much on that right now  I know that's a relapse recipe for me  Seriously  I think I've relapsed more times after grappling with the idea of not drinking ever again than any other trigger  So  as of right now  my goal is today  I also like the idea of milestones  The ones I'm looking forward to are 30 days and 90 days  I have every intention of going beyond 90  but focusing on finite goal is a sort of trick I'm playing on myself so I don't panic  so I can stay in the now  as counter intuitive as that might seem  I'm sure it works differently for others  And that's where we all start    You can do this   I talked to her and she was really upset  to the point where she said she was ready to say fuck off and send me the check for the support i've given thus far and cut me off from the life of the child completely and do it on her own  said she has the support and people she needs and she doesn't need me  she doesn't even consider the baby's need for me  then we talked the next day and she said she understood why I would want the test done but did not say she was going to do it  The tests available while the baby is inside her are intrusive and dangerous  i'm willing to wait 2 or 3 months to find out  there is one test available for pre birth thats not intrusive but it's way expensive   I'm scared also of having to deal with her for the next 18 years  I'm not afraid to be a dad  but scared of dealing with her and her family  i'm very confused  For the next couple of weeks   r cripplingalcoholism is participating in our

something like this  there were 2 possible outcomes   1  I don't like it and have a bad experience  bad situation  2  I like it and now need to fight a sobriety battle on two fronts  worse situation    Thankfully it ended up being scenario 1   I had anxious paranoid thoughts about all the things in my life that are hard and unpleasant for 4 hours  then passed out   No danger of me craving pot again       Still  the "screw it  do it" attitude I had a couple days back is troubling  and I need to be hyper vigilant going forward   Hope  https   www google com search q rhode island client safari hl

not to drink another drop of alcohol  When I first stopped drinking the thought of not drinking again was so very overwhelming but now it's a part of who I am  I can't imagine my life with alcohol in it  I always play the tape forward when taking a drink crosses my mind but it never ends well  I can control my drinking one day at a time   Well I've got that covered   Two months down and feeling awesome  Let's keep on keepin on   read up on this    https   en wikipedia org wiki Delirium tremens The need to worry is relative   Did she have a period of total sobriety from maintenance meds   If not  the transition from something like methadone suboxone to kratom may or may not be a positive thing  positive in that most people seem to have an easier time kicking kratom  negative in that kratom presents a lot of unknowns       If she has been sober from all opioids  it's probably best described as a relapse    She is not really sticking to NA guidelines if she's taking this stuff and still sharing at meetings etc   So there may be an element of deception there    Overall  I think kratom can be positive for users of hard opioids  but it presents its own unique set of problems  I want to become more social and increase my confidence with females  I've never had the balls to ask a girl out before and I want that to change this year  You can do it    And yep  I watched my mother die of lung cancer  It's a shitty  shitty  SHITTY way to go   Way to go  I love my AA meetings  I make it a point  as do others to welcome a newcomer  New people coming to meetings helps me  Please come in  Just adding  and it still was hard to quit smoking  even after that  Addiction is powerful  isn't it  It's not "his" subreddit  It's not "my" subreddit either  We don't own it and we don't control the people who post there       Now You've got me paranoid   haha  It has worked well for me so far  SD has been a great place to be when the urges get strong  Well I'd want her to not be on any of it   all it does is spiral down in 99 9  of cases  Don't think it's that  Other than being irritable I've been wondering why I can't speak correctly to anyone  Mornings seem to be okay and then after a few hours of work I seem okay  otherwise I feel like I'm walking in a haze  Since day 1  Props to you for being able to beat benzos  that's amazing  I'm amazed that you think that was easier than kratom withdrawal  Cold turkey can be rough  but tapering has been super easy as long as you have self control  I'm terrified of gaba like withdrawals  One time I had a small case of rebound anxiety from 2 days of high dose phenibut  Didn't hit me until 3 days later so I was really confused  Just had this constant feeling of impending doom in my guy  Horrible feeling  but only lasted a day  I would take cold turkey kratom days verses any more days like that  Nowadays if I take a high dose pgenibut  I taper down quickly the next 3 days or so  For example  if I take up to 8 grams throughout a day of phenibut  I'll taper the next days like 2 3g  1 6  1 1  0 7  0 3  To avoid any sort of hangover or rebound anxiety  Works like a charm  Gaba drugs aint no joke to fuck with    But yeah  it's hard for me to hate kratom too much to quit completely  I still enjoy it  and usually have good self control with drugs  I initially started using for chronic pain  but now I use recreationally  I know I'll be able to jump off after my taper relatively easy  but still think I'll use occasionally once I've had at least a month clean  Can't hate the drug when we're the ones who abuse it Wow  That's crazy  but I'm glad you're ok  We've got your back  Jesus  I can go to a corner store and pick up a full bottle of shit ass red wine for  3   I'm sorry  R alcoholism is a forum

But then it gets better  I experienced very strong physical cravings  white hot rage  tears  and everything in between  But if you can hang on for three days  getting through it a craving  an hour  a day at time  it gets better  I had feelings of lightheadedness and feeling mentally "fuzzy" as well  Paradoxically I felt short of breath  and found myself taking great gulps of air  breathing very deeply  when the cravings hit  I slept more than usual   Can't long to smoke while you're asleep   I went for long walks to keep moving   I quit in April    But you can do it  Three days of hell  for a lifetime of freedom  Hell  yeah   And everyone's different  it may not even be hell  You might only go through Heck      R alcoholism is a forum for discussion and support   Your post has been

 Go team  Glad you're here with us  Let us know if we can support you at all  Happy new year SM2L  You are a constant inspiration with your prolific online line support across so many subs    Thanks for your service   I am all in with this whole not drinking thing  Strength in Numbers  It's true  I'm a girl      If that helps   Welcome to your new life  You're most welcome my friend   http   www hartford gov   Not far at all      I got to the point of drinking half a litre of Vodka daily  It get's better but the amount you're consuming does need the aid of medical professionals  It also helps telling someone you love and trust    Thank you for your share  You will overcome this  You will get better  You will succeed  You will excel   I'm just cutting it out completely with some nic gum to help the craving  Only 2 pieces today  which doesnt even equal one dip   My cousin has really been pushing me to quit for the past couple years and I've been putting it off  but he told me If he catches me with a can I have to pay him  5    But honestly right now  I feel pretty good  Ultimately I made this decision for me  not because someone else wants me to  and I'm  sticking with it this time  unlike the umpteenth other times I've "Quit" Fuck you and fuck him  you threw your hat in with that dumbass earlier    So sorry he's become a pathetic hatemonger  but you're going to have to suck it up  Buttercup  or denounce him outright     No hedging your bets here  sweetheart  I will not drink with you tonight  Glad you're here  I'm really not in a position to say  I can tell you what happened for me     If you're worried call the doctors offuce and see if you need to bring your appointment forward  That's what I would do   I've been told I get "surly" when I drink  Great to hear  Well done   There's a lot of support and encouragement on this sub  I'm proud of you for simply reaching out  that's a really hard first step and you did it  I think you can take the next step  whatever that might be for you  as well  It gets easier  and you will not regret the decision to stop drinking  Hang in there  friend  I won't drink with you today  I would look into getting a court ordered paternity test if you want to be involved  Text her about this issue that way you have evidence she thinks your the father  It sure sneaks up when you expect it to be over  eh  That's what makes it rough for me  I still miss smoking sometimes  and I still get a craving  It passes    But to say once you've quit and you're glad  that you never wish for it again is wrong  and dismissing that is like overlooking an enemy  Acknowledging it can make it easier to face and defeat it    When I miss smoking  and I still do  despite that it's done nothing for me and killed my mother  I just honestly acknowledge that I do miss something that's bad for me  and that's that way it is  I miss it  it's bad for me  and I can't ever go back to it  Sort of like walking away from an abusive lover  Part of you can still love and miss how he  she  or smoking made you feel    I too miss those moments of solitude and decompression that smoking gave me  Funny  when you can't or don't smoke indoors  it really was a nice way to get a few moments of alone  I even miss the build up of craving and the release of it with that first long  slow  fulfilling drag    But  Life's better without  You know it  I know it  But it's okay to miss it  And just be aware that missing it will come up  long after you think you're over it     Fuck you  hate monger    You are an embarrassment and should not mod any subs    Go fuck yourself  I experienced that alcoholism is a progressive disease   It only gets worse   When my consequences were not yet convincing  I kept drinking until they were too painful to bear and I had to stop   Quitting before desparation is quite extraordinary   Beat wishes to you in being able to stop before your misery forces you to  I won't drink tonight with ya      Down about 10lbs here so far   Hoping to lose about 30 more  Uhh ohhh  This post is going to cause drama   I will  I appreciate the advice The subs have a long half life  You will feel worse soon  Take lots of showers and baths   That's what I was told too  This was an ice breaker for me  I'm gonna try to go as many days as possible  Use water and exercise once the nicotine out of your system man   Limit your coffee as well   Get through each bad moment because it gets better    For me  Moderation does not work and I have no use for it  I want all the Alcohol  That is why I rather have none of the Alcohol  That is why I blew a 10 month run and would have had a year today  But I learned tons and know it does not work for me   When I felt the same as you describe  I timidly crawled into an AA meeting and came out with hope   I haven't needed a drink since  even when my Dad died suddenly in 2014  I'm in  I will not drink with you tonight  Weed is just repressing your anxiety and loneliness  and I smoked daily for over 8 years for the same reason as you    Feeling a little lonely  Not for long  with the help of  20 and a few bong rips  After repressing emotions for so long  it's now difficult to deal with them sober  and I know that it will only get harder the longer I smoke  I'm on day 9 of not smoking now and it sucks  I feel anxious and depressed  and I know that one toke would take all these awful emotions away    But it's not worth it  My brain needs to rewire and learn to function without weed  Quitting sucks  but stay strong  There are so many benefits of quitting  You are not alone     I am just confused about why you're so angry about this  And also why you're arguing about it after saying that you haven't shot up in years  And why you've kept going after everyone has said that you're wrong  Why are you taking this so personally  And are you always so quick to anger  I'm honestly really baffled about how you can't have a civil conversation   Can you just talk to her and ask  Is this something you think she will be honest to you about  I understand your concern  I really do  Heroin is a SCARY thing  It terrifies me   u are an ungreatfull bastard  so go buy some surstrming  Man you like the word "Fuck" a lot  Check out a dictionary and learn a few more you are really showing yourself tonight  I will be fine going over this tomrw  You not so lucky  You have had multiple people tell you are wrong but you shout them down  make threats and swear  Grow up man  Talk like a civil human being  Go watch these on Netflix if you haven't  Black Mirror  The OA Narcos   Amazon Prime has 1 month free trials and you can get Amazon Video with that which has all kinds of great stuff too    A big congrats to all you guys   Tremendous accomplishment   I would love to hear how the year went for some of you guys  some of the highs and lows   And how you feel after completing such a long challenge   365 days is no joke  Nah  You can go fuck yourself   Timbf's a good man  Don't trash talk like you need to be cool to hang   And ate you really giving him shit for modding a community that I'd do close to this one  just with more random deaths   That ain't right  She quit cold turkey  Straight up had her last shot  and she was deep too  her highest being a gram and half a day  and stopped doing it  She never quit smoking weed though so there's always been that element but this Kratom stuff is certainly new  It wasn't buried beneath a bunch of old garbage or something   we're talking just on her bed on top we had 5 empty 1oz bags and then a few pre made capsule bags in 12  24  and 42 counts    Reading online it certainly seems like a major problem if she's doing as much as she is  I mean  this is just on her bed   I don't even want to think about how much empty bags are in her backpack that she freaks out about anytime someone just as much touches it  Thank you for plugging that subreddit  Sorry  CORROSIVEsprings  your post has

amount to take to help with WD      I've played the lope game unfortunately   It dries you out to nothing   IMO  health wise  you're wayyy better off taking 30g of kratom a day   I don't think that stuff should be used at all to get off kratom   You do not want to trade something that is some what "safe " even at large doses  with something that can end up killing you or destroying your heart      Who knows how it will affect your kratom tolerance if you go back   You might need to double your taper dose to get back to where you want to be   It has an extremely long half life     You gotta dump that stuff and not think about it again    Pay me  I could not imagine my life without drinking  it was part of my being   Today I can not imagine sacrificing the gifts of sobriety for whatever temporary relief or pleasure might be left in a bottle   Don't miss it  don't want it  and don't even think about it   My whole attitude has changed  I used Kratom to get off of heroin  It pulled me out  not the other way around  Just personal experience   Once I heard someone say  rock bottom is where you stop digging  I've always known that weed makes me numb to the world  and that's exactly why I used it  I end each month with less than  100 in my bank account because I've spent all of my disposable income on weed  I've known that weed was ruining my life for years    It causes me to want to sit at home alone  lose friends  not care about anything or anyone  just pass the time by getting high    Eventually I just got fed up  I'm tired of being this person  this person is not me  I've gone back and forth about quitting weed for YEARS  This is finally the time  I'm on day 9  and I feel awful  but I can't wait to be the person I want to be  I personally think social media is cancer   In the beginning  I think a lot of us take one hour at a time  Hang in there  Or saltlakrits    But that's delicious though    Yeah  I was thinking a meeting every day or even every other day would be hard  so that's a happy compromise for me  Good luck     We can do this  I too felt for a long time like drinking was a huge part of my social life  indeed   I have social anxiety so I was convinced I needed  alcohol in order to have friends     I never lost a job due to drinking  I never hurt anyone  I wasn't the "skid row" type drinking out of a paper bag on the street  so what was the problem   I agree with another commenter that "high functioning alcoholic" is a stage  not a type  20 years from now  if I'd kept drinking  what would it look like   I'm 29 now  and I quit because I could start to see that my "yets" were getting closer  I didn't have a DUI   yet  But I was starting to drive drunk a lot more  I didn't lose my job   yet  But I was calling out "sick"  drunk  a lot more  I didn't lose any friends yet  But I wasn't talking to them either  When I started blacking out more often and contemplating suicide almost every time I drank  I knew it was about time to stop    Whatever you decide to do   it's great that you're thinking critically about your drinking  I hope you find the answers you're looking for   I like it  I'm an aspiring writer struggling with bulimia as well so I can relate to this one  My favorite lines are "She is only killing herself" and  she savors the emptiness  The only thing that bothers me is the pluralism  I don't know if that's the term for it sorry  english lang was last year  in "the young  the young  old" I would add a "the" before old  Would just flow better  Overall  good work and I hope the best for you    Limit coffee or caffeine  Not much for coffee but ill have a red bull at work  My job is pretty physical so exercise isnt a problem    The toughest part for me is dealing with the anger and stress  Its perfect I have the next two days off so Ill be 3 days in by the time I go back to work   It already has   The problem isn't discussing Kratom because the majority of people here have probably taken it at some point and understand its potential use   It is often discussed here   The problem is that OP is advocating for the use of kratom and becoming angry at anyone whom dares to mention the potential negative consequences of taking it   They seem more like a shill for kratom than a person offering their experiences with the substance  it doesn't help that they offered to send purchase links via PM  DEFINITELY takes longer than 2 weeks  If you've been using it a while  I'm seriously just starting to feel like 90  to baseline at 64 days  I was really getting nervous a week ago that I'd never be the same person  Even though every week got a little better  I never fully felt like my old self  I still would get sad too easily and so unmotivated  I was using it for 4 5 years though  It's crazy shit  I promise myself I will NEVER be addicted to anything like that again  Even if I take something in the future  besides coffee  I'll never take something addicting daily  WDs suck so bad  That was a wake up call  I'm 100  certain moderation will not work for me  I know that once I have 3 or 4 drinks in me  that app will be thrown by the wayside  I don't even bother putting in food in MFP on the days that I drink  I doubt I will bother with this  It's a lot easier for me not to drink  Moderation sounds like torture in all honesty because the entire time I will be craving more   Thank you  Agreed  let's do this  Congrats on one year  Happy Re Birthday   Oh I'm sure but I do know that in the past she wasn't using heroin   no way   just based on attitude and living with her  But I will say that in the past couple months or so  especially  I've noticed that she's been a bit   off   which would coincide with her having this stuff as opposed to when she was acting more normal and had none of this stuff   So while it's possible she relapsed  said nothing to anyone and hid it very well  and then started taking very large amounts of kratom  I found 5 1oz bags on her bed   all empty  to get off of it   OR   she's taking it to get fucked up   Considering her behavior and weird vibes the past several weeks I'm leading more to the latter   Do I leave a comment here to check in for January  Good job man  It can be especially hard when the habit is so ingrained in your everyday life  Just remember that you knw exactly where smoking will take you  it wont be anything new  Knowing that will ease it and make the newfound sobriety a bit more interesting  Keep us posted    If I didn't just want to get out with my liquor I'd say something     I'll take liquor and some judgemental

is good   Don't hide from it   It is important  Your conclusion that you may have a problem with alcohol seems well supported   Fortunately  there is a solution and help is all around you   Best wishes to you in reaching out for it   All that is required is a small amount of honesty  openness and willingness  That's great that he wants to quit and that you want to support him  This has to come from him  though  That's the beginning and the key to a person's sobriety  Good luck Full support for the keeping a journal and cost benefit suggestions below   I've been mostly sober for 2 years and went on and back off in part because of anxiety and not having other ways to cope with them   Perhaps doing a few 30 days clean challenges and during those looking for other ways to deal with anxiety will help you gain some insight into whether or not you feel like you can have a healthy and sustainable long term relationship with alcohol   Kratom is a big part of why I have over 2 1 2 years off heroin  alcohol and all other drugs  It has definitely helped me save my life  I now have an apartment  2 cars  full time job  and actively participate in the community  Not to mention a wonderful family life and amazing girlfriend  To anyone who is passing judgment on responsible kratom use let's remember I once lived on the street and committed crime everyday as a way of life  And for those who say how addictive it is I haven't had any kratom in over 2 days and feel more withdrawals if I skip my morning coffee  My life is amazing today  Whatever helps anyone who used to live how I lived and doesn't live that life any more  I support whatever you're doing   I'm in  it was okay when I was younger but  it's time to stop   Welcome  From what I've read  you might want to also check out  r AlAnon  Al Anon is a long standing support organization for families and friends of alcoholics   I bet you don't feel like a loser today  neither do I  It feels pretty dam good to not be hungover today  I won't drink with you   I didn't really think of it that way but imagine it being very helpful  The habit is so ingrained I've woken up a few times this week and said "I won't smoke til the afternoon" and the next thing I know I've rolled one and it's ready to go  It's habit   That being said habit's can be broken  I'm glad you brought that up  I smoked some pot too  I felt guilty  It wasn't the idea when I decided to get sober  Al Anon is a great place for those of us who love an alcoholic s    Lots of great experience about how to be healthy ourselves and what helps and what hurts the alcoholic s  we love   It's a big step but you sound willing  Forever grateful of this subreddit  18 days clean today   Good luck friend  I'm the same boat  I read somewhere that the liver can heal fast but once it's really fucked up  there's nothing left to do  I may be wrong though  Alcohol can fuck up a liver really bad  With the Benzos  only the first week was really bad   and one week  you forget quickly   no matter how bad it was  Just lucky  because 75  of the  Benzo users have severe PAWS  and I was one of the 25        In addition  most people do not use Benzos for such a long time  But I don't like games of chance   And I don't like the Kratom game anymore    Feeling like a normal person that doesn't feel ashamed of himself  Same  I also feel like this stemmed from me not being my real self  not my best self  So I was attracting the wrong people  But how awesome it is that you recognize this and can turn things around  The ability to change is really motivating for me  Hope things are looking up   Happy new year  See you all on Stay Clean January  We're here  I promise  Now is the time   Get it straight you are so Fucked up that you do not remember i came to back up what she said    Haha whos the dumbass now    Thanks for being open about this  It's soooo hard when you have to pull that bandage back  A big part of it for me was also remembering things that I had allowed myself to bury under weed usage  Healing from this kind of childhood trauma is really a daily job  I wish you the best in this endeavor  Don't give up   Most of those people would complain from coffee WD  If you've ever had to deal with opiate WD you most likely won't have an issue  Almost all of these people have never had to go through opiate WD or any from a hard drug  We are right there with you  one day at a time   Also  if you feel an urge  craving or just mental distraction  try to remember that this mental condition is temporary and that you are able to wait for it to pass  I find your post so motivational  It's post like this that keep me going  Thank you  Love that quote  Taking it for my tool box  I won't drink with you today   Lope didn't help me but kratom did  Everyone is different  So real  Just remember that you don't have to dwell on a mistake just because you spent a lot of time making it  Upward and Onward   Checking in  Here's to another good month of sobriety  It's true for many  Know what's weird  You didn't drink and you're happily posting today  if you drank you would be posting w guilt and shame  I dunno why we drink we always regret it  it's illogical but really hard  Glad you didn't drink d00d This was beautiful to read  thank you  Welcome   There are tons of great resources on the info for the sub  great recommended reading also   A saying that I've grown to deeply appreciate  not sure of the original source   something along the lines of "there's nothing so bad that drinking can't make it worse"   Glad you're here  I just went no contact with my mother this week  It's been 10 years in the making  Tried threats  sit down meetings  going little contact but nothing worked  Finally decided to cut ties and let her figure it out on her own  I have enough going no on in my life without having to worry about hers too   Huh  I'm pretty sure somewhere a child is going hungry tonight  Two things I never waste  Booze and food  I've seen dirt poor  And I'm not OK with being an entitled ass because of that  I get dick pics on the daily      Attractive schlong  I'm in  This is my 4th Day One in 3 months  but I've re established what my goals are in life during the next year and this is only going to make all of them easier  I'm really feeling it right now  let's do this  I'm gonna start my detox off of Xanax next week  Scared shitless   Haven't had a puff of weed since I got hospitalized for my Xanax withdrawal  Been about 2 weeks  I totally identify with you  no desire to get high  but the boredom is fucking rough  Best advice I can give you is to fill up your time with other stuff  I've been watching a new TV show  spending time with my family  and focusing on work    Keep up the good work man  There's more to life than getting high  it's nice to finally be able to see that   It's always a good idea to redirect those "screw it" thoughts before they get out of hand but it sounds like you have a good handle on things  Especially since you're recognizing those thoughts for what they are  Some good things came out of this  and guess what  We made it through to the New Year without drinking  That is an accomplishment all on its own  Congratulations   Welcome   There are tons of great resources on the info for the sub  great recommended reading also   A saying that

That's what the drug literally does to our bains   It's not true   Just take it minute by minute man  Sign me up Raising my la Croix to you my friend  I won't drink with you tonight  Thank you left clique  this is helpful  Hi there   302 days ago  I was in the twenty a day club  My liver area hurt  I sweat constantly  and my life was such a mess  It took a DWI and the possibility of losing my family to jolt me out of it  It is hard at first  but you will be amazed how quickly your body heals  You can do this   Welcome back  I tested the waters after 10 months off and regret it  But I take what I learned to make a stronger run at never drinking again  I will not Drink with you   Hi and congrats   I have 47 days and totally understand your feeling  Just this week I avoided meetings  What has helped is to go to the meeting and be with others in recovery and to raise your hand and share what youve shared here  I have done exactly the same thing and have been stunned with the help I have received   The other thing that helped me was going to many many different types of meetings and groups  I live in NYC and am lucky this way so I understand it may be harder  Gettibg my butt in a chair and sharing for me is the most important  Trying out different types of meetings is the next most    Just my experience     I've made the mistake of thinking I could go back to casual use after 54 days clean   Almost 8 weeks in and I started it up again   thinking I could use 3x a week at most  Well like you'll find time and time again with people who think they can go back to limited use after abusing this substance   3 times a week turned into 4  then 5  then daily   then multiple times a day and I ended up back to where I started before my initial quit  Unfortunately my ego got in the way and I figured I "wasn't like everyone else"  and I could go back to sustainable usage   To my dismay   I am like everyone else and I got hard core addicted again  though fortunately my bender only lasted a month before I gave it up again  26 days today   Though you may truly be different and could manage casual use   I think the stats say otherwise and you should just go no contact on this substance like it's an emotionally physically abusive ex  P Hey  despite resetting your badge  drinking for a few days does not change what you've accomplished in your sobriety   Learn from your experience  becoming stronger so as to not let it happen again  and enjoy being sober again    Best of luck to you  Thanks  I feel like I take advantage of this thought too much though I guess  Like I will manipulate myself into ending up smoking every day again and haven't been able to stop that yet  it's a continuous cycle of stopping  wanting some and then smoking consistently again  And if I can't smoke weed it will be drinking  not to same extent  or smoking cigarettes    I'm trying to stop this feeling I get  but when I actually think about it it really doesn't even help and makes me emotionally less stable and able to deal with life  Works harder  relationships are harder  thinking is harder    but I'm numb so I don't care  Thanks for taking the time to respond   Appreciate the response  it's like it's too hard to even write down that I will because if I fail I have physical proof   I will not drink with you tonight   I like that line   "   missing out on the "fun" of drinking  I skipped drinking so I wouldn't miss out on the fun today "   Yes  a personal anecdote of an experience that didn't end well is evidence that the individual whom had the experience is just "scared of kratom" because they "know it works" and will no longer have an "excuse "  I am sure everyone on r quittingkratom is also just "scared of kratom " For me day 1 and 2 were the worst  I stayed busy  I filled every moment with activity so I wouldn't think about drinking  This sub was extremely helpful as well  After day 2 everything got better daily  There is a light at the end of that tunnel  I won't drink with you today   Minute by minute  hour by hour  day by day  week by week  month by month  It all adds up but it all starts with minute by minute   8 hours is a good start  Be strong  Keep it up  Keep your mind occupied  If you're not making over  10K per year gaming  just don't come back to it    unless it's co op on a simple  silly game with your nephew on the Playstation in the living room   I'm so proud of you for going  It was scary and overwhelming for me at first too    Ultimately sticking with AA was the single best decision of my life   Checking in  One step at a time No matter what I say you're going to try and come up with some rebuttal and wave your dick around  Agreed  I fucking hate what social media has become  No one is "waving their dick around" except you   You have been attacking anyone that replies to you that doesn't agree and or has an alternative experience to the one you have claimed to have  I hear ya man  I used for about 4yrs and at one point basically carried a big ass bag of it around everywhere I went and shoveled handfuls of the nasty shit in my mouth all day everyday  I was taking insane amounts the height of my addiction  I got so fed up with this shit a year ago that I said fuck it and quit everything    Adderal  pot  antidepressant  xanax  and pretty much booze too  The fact that kratom made me feel so gawd awful  gave me the motivation to quit everything  Managed to kick all the others but kratom keeps fucking with me  It's all out mental warfare to kick this plant but I'm determined this time to do it   Thank you  it definitely sometimes feels embarrassing to talk to people about as it has this stigma of not being so bad and there are all these other drugs out there which are much harder on your body withdrawal wise  I know something is wrong  at this point it's just a cycle of quitting and taking back up again  I just can't seem to find meaning in life without a substance  like alcohol  weed or even smoking cigarettes  I'm trying to get something that I can't ever reach and the constant anxiety surrounding it  especially since my partner is aware and actively wants me to stop  is exhausting   I am confident I can quit again but     like always within a month will always start back up or try manipulate my way into smoking  it's fucked   Exactly   I did whatever it took to stay calm that first day   ate whatever I felt like  took 3 showers  played video games  whatever   You've got this  Happy New Year  MWR  2016 had it's share of lows for me  but there was a lot of good stuff too  I learned that I could do something that I didn't believe I could do  I haven't felt confidence in myself like this in a long time  it feels really good  Looking forward to the year ahead  and spending time with everyone here at SD    Joining the day 1 January 1 crowd today  Last night I discovered at 47 peer pressure still works  With friends  safe place  but I was not supposed to drink and I did  Today I was sober though     Hope you're doing better  Take care of yourself   Come find us in the chat  There are usually people around to hang with  There is a link on the sidebar   Welcome  I can totally relate to your post   It is so NOT worth it  anxiety and feelings of hopelessness    Cheers to us refusing to give up  Extracts don' defeat the purpose of using kratom that is hyperbolic  UEI  and the OPMS shit  Sure  Fuck that shit  But extracts are just like cannabis concentrates  Not for everyone  and can have a negative impact on tolerance  but just like normal kratom  the negative impacts will be a result of abuse and not proper use    I take extract enhance blends  that I make and sell  every day  Because there is extract in it  i never have had to up my dose  I take 3 5 grams and that's it    Not everyone can gulp down 10 grams of kratom without experiencing stomach discomfort or vomiting  Extract can seriously help those in need       Yay         Wow  I don't believe the "coincidence"   I started at age 13 and drank alcoholically for 30 years to age 43   13 years ago tonight I was getting arrested   I came home and drank into Jan 2  so Jan 3 is my sobriety date   I went to AA  followed directions and haven't had a drink since   Amazingly  I haven't had a troubling thought about drinking after that first year   If I can do it  I am pretty sure you can too as well as just about anyone else who has a sincere desire to stop   Get this first 24 hours under your belt and I'll work hard to do the same  Wouldn't it be better to get real girls and have real sex  I will be finishing one year without fapping tomorrow and it's awesome  What I am now working on is quitting porn  On the same timeline brother Welcome ThreeFistsCompromise   I'm not drinking with you tonight    Awesome  Great work  As others said  Al anon can be a great resource    This might not be what your looking for but I asked my wife what she did to support me when I got sober  we had only been dating for 3 months when I got siber   We used to drink a lot together     I changed a lot of my life style  There's no alcohol in the house    I stopped drinking mostly  And I never drank around you  Especially when you first got sober    I made it clear that if there was ever a situation that you didn't want to be in  we could just leave  no questions asked    I tried not to be judgmental    Encouraged anything that you thought aided in your sobriety  Like AA    An open line of communication about alcohol    Those are her words  I'm sure if you'd like  she could talk to you about it    Great post   Glad you made the transition past being a lurker    I genuinely enjoyed your story     Keep posting  would love to see your progress  Would be awesome to see how you're doing after your first full day  or even a few days from now   I'll keep my eye out for you   u love of hockey    Got offered edibles from my old hook up  Easily turned them down  He congratulated me on being clean for a year  Give the account to me    s    Though seriously  good luck man  I have quit many times before  my issue is starting up for "just a couple joints" one night and starting every day again  The first week will suck  but then it starts lifting and everything feels easier and you feel happier  but you also think "I feel so good would be awesome to have a smoke"  I try to just sleep a lot when I quit and read or watch tv  I am usually irritable and down  Every time I get caught at about the month mark with this "would be awesome to have a few joints" feeling which progresses to bongs everyday   When you're smoking it it feels normal to smoke everyday  being straight feels wrong  This does change  don't doubt that  I wish you well   As a camp counselor when I was about 15  a kid told me she wanted to have spots on her face just like me when she grew up  Don't read too much into it   This is wonderful advice  I'll just add that sometimes even a day is a bit much to chew  Sometimes it's just an hour or two that I need to focus on   That's so awesome  Happy new year     It's like a demon  But thankfully it gets conquered everyday by people with will power and patience   The hurdle of not drinking with your friends is simple  If they care their not your friends  Getting sober is for you  Only  If your coming here you might be an alcoholic cause you can't control your drinking  you go on a bender fuck up and fear keeps you sober  I would recommend a meeting of alcohols anonymous and look at step 1     Congrats on your First Week   The first few are really tough but I know you're tougher   Keep fighting the good fight and Happy New Year    you'll have to eventually anyway  Kratom will stop working  I don't see why or how this is true  Kratom should never stop working if someone uses once or twice a week  The problem is  only using once or twice a week and never doing more than that takes a lot more willpower than most of us have  There's a lot to unwind there  but one small thing is dealing with parties   A huge weight was lifted off my shoulders when I started planning for social events   I thought about what I would say if offered a drink   I made plans to leave if I felt weird   And most importantly  if I felt at all weird i skipped it   And the funny thing was that as I started telling people I wasn't drinking  it got easier   I had some accountability  people were supportive and I relaxed   Give it a shot   I was uncomfortable not drinking when I was planning my next relapse  because I worried that people might "hold me to it "  I know now I was always planning to relapse     It can be done  I am much more relaxed in social settings now and life is going on nicely without booze     I won't drink with you today  I've never had a problem with weed  I'm in my 30's and I've probably used it    2 dozen times my whole life  and I live in CO  I consider it a better option in every way compared to booze  Honestly  if my relationship with booze were the same as it is with weed I would never think about "quitting" because I really never really feel like I've "started"   He says if I leave him that I'm giving up on us  You aren't a prick  the chemicals in your brain have rewired so you aren't able to make a decision about this in the same way you could if you weren't smoking  I think insight into your own mind helps  write down how you feel when you are feeling crap  and remember you are feeling this way because you take drugs every day  It feels normal to take drugs everyday  but it's not  Once you get past the hard part this will be clear  Be kind to yourself   Aw  mommy didn't bring you the right sammich  How about get off your ass and make her one  In a very very similar situation myself  Also engaged and having the same internal battle regarding my father's presence in my life  I recently blocked him on my phone for a week or so as a trial run  basically just to get through the holidays without his emotional turmoil    While every situation is different and this certainly will not work for everyone  my personal approach has been to reinforce good behavior and to "cut ties" when he is exhibiting bad behavior    I would not recommend telling your mother you are cutting ties or distancing yourself  If it just happens "naturally"  will probably save you a very upsetting and unproductive conversation if you had confronted her   Great response man  I think you have a level head about it and are much more mature than I was when I went through that ordeal  18 21   Your goal of not using this as a permanent solution is spot on  When I started my meds I believed that it was "the solution" to my problems  And after the pills made life worse  I decided that weed was the solution  I've quit before and my life got back on track and my issues pretty much disappeared  But the sweet herb pulled me back in after a trip out to Colorado to see family and it led to me being dependent on it again even though I knew I was better off without it deep down    I guess that's addiction  I'm on day 4 now of quitting and I already feel my homeostasis coming back with exercise  meditation  stretching  reading and playing music  When I get stoned I don't get any dopamine from those activities  and they don't help as much  When I'm sober  they give me the happy focus chemicals I need help me center myself when I start losing my direction  I've also found that I can get the adderall effect from a simple double shot espresso  I like to think that the coffee bean is more natural than amphetamines  and I'm able to utilize it on an "as needed" basis  I think we've got similar stories and it's great to feel like I'm not alone in this  I bet there are tons going through the same thing      I especially enjoy the added energy and general sense of peacefulness that sobriety is graciously giving to me   Oh man  that sounds amazing    yes  please  I am looking forward to that   Well said  I can be a grade A shit talker  but never violent  except occasionally to doors  I'm happy for you and your great day as well      That's awesome   Hey  man   I'm struggling too   You aren't gone  You're right here  Just like me   You posted here  That isn't a small thing  That's a start  Starts are the hardest thing   Change isn't easy  This new start will take you some place  You'll make new starts after that  You're always welcome here   Drinking is a habit because it works  You have a reason or a need to drink   There's another path to what you need  A different way to be safe or happy or connected or excited or whatever you're looking for    And that way won't kill you  And it won't make you hate yourself  And it won't leave you a broken mess every day   You started  You'll find it  You started at thinking about killing yourself and found your way here to ask for help   I'm already proud of you  Reading "This Naked Mind" has really helped me change a lot of my thinking about alcohol    that sentence came out of that new line of thinking  Still a work in progress  definitely  but    so far  I haven't regretted  not  drinking      I agree  but in my  3 weeks of experience of being clean  the mental part is easier to manage   There are supplements you can take and things you can do to help   You can forget about the depression and cravings     With the early physical WD stage  you're just there for the beating   If you're kicking bad  haven't slept in a 4 straight days  there isn't anything that is going to help other than another opioid     The first part of quitting is breaking the habit   The physical withdrawal symptoms are what keeps people using daily   Breaking that pattern of daily use  and more importantly  knowing it can be broken  is a huge step in the right direction      I used stuff for over 6 years  never once clean for 24 hours   I thought it was going to be terrible   I was terrified   It ended up not being so bad   Maybe I got lucky   Maybe I expected worse   But it is easier to sell someone on a week than saying you're pretty fucked for 30 60 days   No one knows how bad their WDs will be until they try and get to a certain point     I did ok today  I ran my fingers along the healing skin toward the evening which I could have limited had I reapplied lotion  I didn't worsen it  though  No new damage but it could have happened    I was just fortunate  Man that sucks  I had an old guy tell me  If I don't get up off my dead lazy ass and go enjoy life and stop dragging around my alcoholism with me  It's nobodies fault but my own  And you know he's right  See what y can add to the stream of life Stay strong  First 3 days are the worst   We got this  Nice  Keep it up  One day at a time  There have been a lot of alcoholics in my life    My father is an alcoholic  he has been for about 30 years  I cut off our relationship five years ago when I realized he was never going to change because he didn't see anything wrong with his alcoholism and drug abuse  Hardcore denial    My mother in law has been in AA for eight years  She hasn't touched a drop of liquor in that time  but she substituted a painkiller addiction  That got rid of the violence  but now she's totally vacant when high  and emotionally aggressive conniving when searching for drugs  My husband only talks to her a few times a year because it's painful to interact with her through her drug abuse    My maternal grandmother joined AA in the 1980s and she has kept showing up  She's still not perfectly sober  she's never been able to go a whole year without drinking  Earlier this year  I picked her up from a public park where she was drunk as a skunk after drinking a bottle of schnapps    but those incidents are far between and she keeps going back to AA  It's a lot easier to handle because she's trying hard to battle her demons    So it's definitely not easy  And it's worse when they won't admit they have a problem  The hard part is that they'll never get there until they're ready to  The only thing you can do is establish healthy boundaries to protect yourself   You got this  Are you checking out local AA meetings  Rad  glad to hear your on your last bag  Don't let yourself down and buy another  It's crazy to think we work a job we hate  just to get money so we can get stoned and enjoy music when there's an entire industry of dedicated musicians that are making a living off of playing music whether they smoke or not  I really want to get my priorities straight and start pursuing music because it is my only true passion  No more working to buy weed  I need to start working to satisfy my heart It really doesn't matter if you consider yourself an alcoholic  problem drinker  or a Drunky McDrunkface  The label or severity is not so important  What it important is the desire to stop drinking and it looks like you have that   I tried many times to stop  I would go days or weeks  But I always set a limit  I'd tell myself that I wouldnt drink for two weeks  But at midnight at the end of the second week  I'd have a beer in hand  counting down the seconds    When I got sober I didn't set a time  I decided it was time for a change and that's what this requires  a life style change  But it's a pretty simple one    It's not like going to the gym where you have to drag yourself there  All you have to do is literally not drink  Willingness to do whatever it takes is all it takes   The rest of the life style sort of comes with it  And it's all good  even what seems like bad  Like losing drinking buddies who you thought were friends but really just want someone to drink with  You'll learn who your real friends are   I just celebrated 18 months of sobriety  I stopped counting days after 6 months  My life has completely chabged  I mean 180 turn around in that time  You can look at my post from yesterday if you'd like   Stopping drinking is the most important thing I've ever done  I would be digging myself into an early grave if I didn't stop  I'm sure of it   How old are you  And why did you post this here  And maybe a homeless person would have eaten that instead of you throwing it away   If your an alcoholic you have three ends if you keep drinking  Wet brain  dead  prison mental institution  To drink is to die brother You'll always have support here  Everyone is great   Have you considered what options are available to you  Do you know if you'd like to do a set program  and if so  do you now what is available in your area  Or if you'd prefer something self directed  If so  Annie Grace's book 'This Naked Mind' is available free of charge on this sub   Either way I would get to the doctor or the ER ASAP first of all   20 beers a day is enough to cause some dangerous withdrawal symptoms  You can talk about options for initial detox  then think about how you want to tackle ongoing recovery  There's heaps of options for this and there will be a way that suits you    There is no problem so bad that alcohol can't make it worse   It might feel hopeless now but everyone that gets sober has felt this way at some point  There is hope for you even though you can't see it  The alcohol is talking right now   once you take away the alcohol  the world will be a much brighter place    Good luck and stay in touch  Being optimistic is really a double edged sword    It does show incredible strength on your part that you are willing to be helpful while still distancing yourself  That is a very healthy outlook on the situation and I applaud you for it   I was an angry drunk  more often than not   I never found anything that helped it  it would just happen and I was so so mean   Honestly I think you're best bet is to try not to black out or know what's going to happen if you do  limit your contact with people if you want to get that shit faced   It's hard not to cross the line  but you can still get pretty schnockered without blacking out  takes practice I suppose  What the fuck are you talking about I was on the road to killing myself or being in prison for the rest of my life on Roxi's and Methadone  I found out about Kratom and used it as well as Cannabis to finally stay off pharmaceutical opiates for what I'm confident will be forever  unless obviously a major trauma event happened   I still do take it daily and have not chosen to quit altogether  but I can take tapered T breaks  I don't abuse it because I can't just take what I need  I'm not and never would go stealing for it  I can last over a month on less than  100  I can do things I can't with opiates   I can quit  but it curbs my cravings like Methadone and works for my little moderate pain  that Ibuprofen or OTC medications truly do not  I ended up in it all because of a legitimate prescription when I was 14 and it went downhill quick  I live in Florida and if you do too you know how cheap plentiful it was in 2008 2012   It's definitely not a solution and by no means a cure  but it can help what seems to as much as Methadone and Suboxone which are so much more toxic  Like anything  daily use may cause addiction and WILL cause physical dependency  Tapered T breaks should be taken with all drugs  but if you by chance can't  unlike Methadone or Suboxone you're not going to have the truly  crushing  depression  severity of RLS  pain  shitting yourself and puking  You're not going to overdose and die from it  All the janky packaging in head shops and OPMS and all those bullshit companies  yeah they're not cool  But legitimate vendors who truly have knowledge on herbal supplements are just fine  If you're just abusing opiates to get high  it may be not be for you but by all means is still worth a shot  If you're abusing them because you're also prescribed them and need pain management  you have a good chance of it benefitting you  If you are going to go the suboxone mmt route then Kratom is worth a try  Of course quitting substances all together is the best thing you can do  but this is more for the ones who still struggle with depression  cravings  occasional use  etc  and aren't against trying another option  Even home made 4 5x extract blends are great because it got me off 140mg Methadone dose  It shouldn't be used as a crutch and it needs to be understood  but to not realize the harm reduction in it compared to what Big Pharma has out  you're blind    I read 3oz Maple Syrup    now I can't stop throwing up everywhere  Thanks op I don't think anyone likes to think of themselves as an alcoholic   in fact I think everyone here tried to negotiate the hell out of not being one  Anything but that    But seriously  I recognize a lot of myself in your post   I couldn't bring myself to discuss it with my SO either  because that would be 1  acknowledging a real problem and thus 2  I would have to do something about it    I went back and forth a lot  am I or am I not an alcoholic  should I drink tonight or not   and frankly wasted a lot of time  and endured more consequences   but that was the path I chose to take     Not surprisingly when I finally did accept that I was an alcoholic  whatever that means  and did come clean with my husband  I was finally able to stop  and everything got a lot easier   And for what it's worth  even when I admitted to my most hateful  humiliating  horrible secret and how much I had been struggling  I found that in that moment  I actually  earned  his respect  He really had no idea what I was going through  still doesn't to some extent     He was sad that I had kept him in the dark  that I had struggled alone  that I didn't trust him enough to be open with him      In addition to this sub  I also found the recovery podcasts like The Bubble Hour  hugely helpful     Hang in there    Sign me up I will not drink with any of you tonight  Happy New Year   It's definitely not a panacea for addiction   You had me there  Congratulations and happy new years   NICE  Only 332 more days for mine      Congratulations  The importance of perspective and self care are things of which I feel many people  myself included   need to be reminded   In one of your replies  you said something that reminded me of Gloria Anzalda's  Borderlands La Frontera   she describes the importance of looking yourself in the eye  even when you don't recognize or are afraid of your reflection  Your internal Shadow Beast is a part of you  and is a part of your own power and efficacy  Self knowledge  assuming all the parts of who you are  embracing the parts of yourself  or reframing them  in productive ways that don't necessarily correspond to what other people society expect from you are all ideas that help me remember that I was made for a purpose  that I am part of a greater plan  There is power in naming yourself an alcoholic  because once you look your Shadow Beast in the eye  that is when you can more authentically engage in the world around you  Goodness knows I would want to tell my 12th grade self that    it would have saved me from a lot of hiding and would have made me find my own power over the people who only see its monstrosity a lot sooner  Let me guess    It was a shitty car to begin with and you have no insurance   Who cares you would have lost that job anyway   You would have found a reason to     Now drink   Bye fam   I'm a Leo      Astrology isn't real   I was ok when it was just a Friday  or Saturday drinking    Some are saying that it's ok to drink once in a while now  But I was so much better when I didn't drink at all   That's what's up man  I think we can both do it I completely agree  I live in SE WI and have family in the central part of the state  Even though the drinking cultures are different  the common denominator in most activities is alcohol  How did you stop drinking  Gotcha  Ill keep an eye out for that  Im a little jittery to begin with so I might have to cut it out  This is the first time quitting that ive actually felt confident about it  Every other time was well ill try and see how it goes   My 2016 sounds a lot like yours   I was thinking this morning  well  I guess it worked out  because all those relapses were the opportunity to get all of my tools in order  but they seem to be working pretty well now   Here's to running in 2017  Thank you  Oh sorry next time we will provide caviar and lobster    Get out of here you prick  I know what you mean  every so often my brain is racing with thoughts of how to get some  how I could hide it etc  it helps to know someone else is going through this too   Even if it's internet comrades  it's nice to know others exist     I was doing pretty good recently and had a relapse  There's always the "I was better off before that PMO" feeling   Good for you  fam  Have a good day tomorrow  You deserve it  When we was young we would get that canned ham mixed with potatoes   you know what we were grateful at least there was something on the plate Since I quit drinking  I've smoked a few cigarettes here and there which I was not happy about   I'm trying not to get caught up in perfectionism  while simultaneously not totally going of the rails either    Priority one is not drinking   that's my manta at the moment   Very minimal research done at all but I think OP is saying he took 30 mg of Immodium and not the Loperamide  I'm currently at day 15 of my C T off a 30g day for 6 months habit  In 30mg of Immodium there is only 4mg of Loperamide  I have taken 30mg of Immodium on days 4 7 9 14 and 15 and I did not feel like I was megadosing  Also at that dose I am almost positive that it's not prolonging my withdrawals as I haven't noticed a change from taking it  However I don't see the point at all of taking the two together  Please correct me if I'm wrong and 30mgs of Immodium is megadosing as I'll immediately abandon doing that  Not sure why I needed to remind myself why I stopped in the first place but here I am anyway  Could have been a lot worse as things go   Thank you  Two years of pretty consistent scrutiny for being a vegetarian has prepared me for this  Since you mention English  Oversee means to watch supervise  like a boss oversees their employees  The word you're looking for is overlook  This makes me really happy  Sending warm  sober 2017 wishes your way  Good luck  You moved to a place that when I visited it briefly  I was shocked at the overwhelming presence of cigarettes and wine as the national raison d'tre  No I don't believe I'm addicted  I was just curious what the far side looked like  I wish you all the very best in overcoming the addiction and hopefully one day being able to balance it out equally     If not  there is plenty of life outside gaming  getting addicted to sports is great way and you can do it with friends  You're on for 92 days according to the flair  you're doing great    I'd definitely recommend detox and rehab if you have the insurance to do it  I know you may have life committments but a lot of people I've dealt with in recovery lost their job relationships etc because they were getting high  Physical withdrawas are bad but the mental craving is still there  and while a week is phenomenal  when I would try to be clean at home the fact that I had been doing heroin for a couple years and opiates even longer made it that I would go back to my old habits and get high  I needed to re learn how to live without drugs and in my eyes the best thing for rehab for me was giving me time away from the drug in s safe environment  The comfort meds worked wonders along with the suboxone so that you don't feel too bad at all   In terms of easing wd at home  this may sound stupid but I would take hot baths and lay my legs out because the rls always got to me and the hot water seemed to really help that  I would then read in the bath to try to divert my attention and focus on something else  Listen to me you need to get married to this broad  Who cares if she's a sloot that's hot  She's been around   so what    tell her to take a shower and you're good to go  Day one for me as well  Congrats on the first 8 hours  Wishing you luck on the rest of day 1 and on your day two  You've got this  So do I have a problem  I drink when because at the time I tell myself it's ok  but then regret it after   That worked for you  and I'm glad it worked out that way  However  alcoholics aren't always that nice  especially when it comes to discussing their drinking problem  I know I always felt guilty  like I was walking on eggshells  whenever I tried to bring up drinking around my ex  He was very   like he did NOT want to talk about it  He didn't want to talk about it with me  let alone anyone else  That is quite a lot    It's great you noticed it as a problem and are doing something to combat it     I wish you the best for this new year McDonald's is not that bad dude  That shit is damn good compared to what a lot of CAs eat  Fuck I don't even have food today because I celebrated yesterday by eating today's food too  Meaning 3 packs of ramen  I'd straight up devour McDs man be thankful  AA does not explicitly recquire a belief in God  only a "higher power"  It can be literally anything except yourself  I'm agnostic and go to AA type meetings regularly and it doesn't feel too religious imo  I would at least try AA and  if you don't like it  then try a different group  sign me up starting over  You're on 1 day  you can totally do this  I believe in you  Woah   this Wellness plan worksheet is perfect for a self improvement nerd like me  Thanks VE  Congratulations  Great post  thank you  hahahha that wa funny Thanks  I think I have all the proof I need at this point and know that I am better off when not drinking  Many of us here will have heard all of this before from alcoholics in our lives  They are consummate liars and manipulators  They will always try and turn the blame away from themselves and onto someone else   often you or anyone else close  They will rationalise their drinking   seizures  etc   and say they are 'controlling' their drinking   Most of all they are constantly lying to themselves  After 2 years trying to help a close friend and neighbour  I realised it was destroying my life and I've opted out of being his shoulder to cry on  listener to all his self hate and anger at the world and people around him  anger at everything apart from the one thing they should be angry at   their drink addiction   You say he says if you leave him that YOU are giving up  Let's be honest here  he gave up a long long time ago  Your relationship is way down his list of priorities right now and all you are is a companion on his journey into oblivion   You have to get out of this situation now because the longer you hang around the longer it will take for him to accept he has   and he is   the problem   Will he do anything about it  That is entirely down to him  Nothing you can do or say will make him deal with it  I wish I could tell you the magic words or spell to make an alcoholic face up and start dealing with their addiction but  it doesn't exist   If you leave will he get better  Impossible to say  It's 50 50 at best but if you stay you'll just get dragged down with him for years until he either gets worse or finally get help and recovers   You're not giving up on your relationship but you must give up on him until he gets himself sorted   I used alcohol to numb me from all of my feelings  Very high functioning for the most part but it was slowing get worse  I am a stubborn sob and just made up my mind that I was done    It's been a rough road  Having to face emotions instead of drink has been the toughest  I found a therapist that I like and that has really helped    If YOU think that you should quit  then go ahead and do it  Challenge yourself to see how long you can go without a drink  Don't think about "forever"  that is difficult for anyone  1 day at a time  as the saying goes   With the onset of speech problems I would be concerned about something neurologically going on  I think it warrants a doctor visit sooner rather than later    Not to scare you  but slurred speech and inability to get words out can be symptoms of a stroke   Wow  this is powerful  I'm so glad you made it through that  Happy 2017  Admitting you have a problem is just about the hardest part  The next hardest is taking the first step to fixing the problem  Hope to see you stick around  we are all in this fight together    use it as a way to run from every single problem that arises in my life to the point where I become completely dependent on the feeling of gaming in order to get me through the day    This is never a good thing  when I used to get even mildly upset and used to be pretty depressed  I slept through many days of my life without realising  This sounds fairly similar to you  8 days is strong  it takes 3 months to cultivate a habit  I think  You can do this man   Same  Growing up  it was always around at parties  as teens my brother grew it  I've always been able to get it and there's some here at my cabin now  It just doesn't occur to me to use it or  on the rare occasion that I do  it's like another 6 months or a year before I do again  Ah  if only my favorite red wine were like that   Isn't waking up without anxiety about the previous night fabulous   I put away my Christmas decorations  had brunch with a friend  amidst quite a few hungover looking folks   went to the gym  tried to get a pedi  every salon I tried was closed  and finished out the day with a short run  I really  really love and hold dear my sobriety  I've dated some straight up whores before  Honestly not too fun at all  I tend to avoid falling for those types now  I don't really care about how many dudes you've fucked but if you fucked most of the dudes from my social circle that's just not gonna work for me Thanks to this group  It gives me an anchor when om lost  Great job on a year  You give me hope  You have inspired me to keep track of my own positive achievements over this next year sober so that I can revisit them at the beginning of next year  I think i'll keep a journal  Thank you for the post  I won't drink with you today   The last week  not so much  I guess realtivley is the key word  so that way  yes  And I've just completely resumed normal life from yesterday  When I do finally get home I immediately hit up my games but that's only because I don't have any work   Thank you for this post   Awesome    One of the craziest things that I've noticed the past few months is how obsessed people are with when my husband and I are going to start drinking again  We initially said that we would quit for 6 months and then go into moderate mode  lol   but I love being sober so much that I really can't imagine going back to drinking    I'm at the age where everyone is getting married  and I already have some wedding related events on my calendar for this summer  Almost everyone I've talked to brings my drinking up  saying "Oh thank god you'll be drinking again for  event  "    as if my drunkenness will determine the outcome of your bachelorette party    On another note  that's fantastic about your mom  I love hearing stories like yours that offer hope    Hey thanks so much  Drinking just really hasn't done anything   beneficial long term for me  I suffer from pretty bad anxiety as well and drinking always makes it worse the day after  hangovers cause intense anxiety for me  so I am just looking for an overall change and to get rid of this dad bod haha  Glad to be here   You aren't crazy and you aren't too far gone  I'm 24  and drank a fifth of whiskey everyday until I got sober last summer  I'm a 110 lb  girl to make that amount even more ridiculous   I actually tried to kill myself a couple of times in my last year of drinking  I thought I had ruined my mind  but it is still here    With that amount  you may benefit from a hospital stay for detox or better yet treatment  but I've seen people who drank more than either of us get sober without medical intervention  Is AA something you would ever consider  Gets a little cultish  I'm a paranoid person as well  especially when I drank  but it helps me a lot   Yeah i know it scares me too  Dont know when the stroke would have happened  I don't remember anything happening  Why would it fluctuate so much too  Like mornings it feels better than afternoons  Nights feel better too after work  Congratulations on triple digits and happy new year to you  too  Awesome man  glad you're ok now   I played it off as a joke  That's how I usually defuse things like that  Great job  Love it  We went to a friend's house for the Packer game tonight and were there for a nightmarish 30 minutes before leaving   they had all been drinking for 48 hours and I'm pretty sure there was a girl eating pizza in her sleep  Seeing people approach their twenties thirties and telling me that they're no longer into gaming because they have friends and family   This  this is what confuses me  I totally agree that getting busier means gaming a little less  but I can't imagine I'd ever completely abandon games  As I've become older I've started watching movies and TV shows a lot less to fit in gaming in my shorter and shorter free time    Multiplayer games are crazy time consumers  that's sadly the genre I like best  There's no story or single objective to go through like single player games  I like your approach of only playing those  that allows you to balance it out and get back to real life without worrying about pausing    Congratulations everybody   Looking forward to a clean January and a clean 2017   This month was a tough one for me   My semester of college ended and I found myself with more free time with nothing to do   I also have very little money because I have to start paying for the next semester of college out of pocket  so I couldn't go out anywhere really   I was stuck at home fighting boredom and loneliness   I'm proud I didn't have any relapses  but it was hard    Wow  I could have written this   Thank you    When I said that I mena headshop extracts that are sold for people who are trying to get high  The ones that may or may not have some crazy shit in them  Welcome  I will not drink with you today  They probably gave him benzos for anxiety  and those can be used to safely cold turkey off the alcohol without the fear of strokes  Start at the prescribed dose and then come down in dose over the next week or so until he gets to zero  He will have them successfully gotten off the booze and avoided benzo addiction Keep your head up  Loosing people sucks ass  one of the many reasons I continue to push on today instead of being a victim of my own mind   Oh yeah  and no more drinking as soon as the benzo is started  When is it time to let go  Will that help him realize    I can't tell you when it's time for you to let go   I threw in the towel when I realized that my relationship was so severely damaged and I was so angry that not even his sobriety could fix it    Will it help him realize  Maybe   Maybe not   Your departure may be his rock bottom    With that said  I watched a family member decimate every relationship in their lives and ultimately drink themselves to death so    Some people don't have a rock bottom    You can't control him   You can control you   You can take care of yourself and learn to love him in a way that keeps your sanity intacted  Alanon meetings helped me immensely     She's so smart  she likes science and animals and a degree in microbiology  She teaches anatomy at a college  I don't understand why it doesn't make sense to her  I really don't  It still boggles my mind after all these years   Alcoholism doesn't discriminate against intelligence  I'm still in the first 100 hours and I've been making friends  I used to be hooked to tf2 for the longest period of time and the free game Paladins finally tipped me into buying Overwatch and so far I've had a blast    Tech hobbies such as  That sounds cool  D  And a more productive substitute   To quote Lcio   sorta   "You're gonna do great"  This is irrelevant  but a long time ago I ordered a cheeseburger from McDonald's and they forgot the patty  I ate that shit anyway  It wasn't bad  I kind of miss those shitty McDoubles  Sigh    The last few years my parents have come to visit and they stock up on weed  Back in 2015 they left some cough drops with me  there were like 10 or so of them  When they came out again they were mostly there and they asked if I just didn't like them  I was like no I really enjoy it  just as a rare treat  If only I could say that about good beer or a manhattan  HAHA  can you imagine comfortably drinking like 4 beers in an entire year and not even having it come to mind  There are people out there like that  WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE    Yeah  headshop extracts suck  I bet a decent amount of them are spiked with Chinese opioids fucking losers On the other hand  what part of life does alcohol fulfill for you  It's mind boggling how invested people are   not in sobriety  but in their efforts to get us to drink  We have some family friends that literally have a countdown to when we initially said we would start drinking again  back when we were newly sober and terrified to imagine our lives without alcohol   I smile and play along because I don't want to make it weird  but in reality I just feel bad for them   The early days suck  For me  it seemed like it was mostly breaking the habit of drinking and finding other ways to occupy my time  Maybe you can find a substitute beverage  or game that you enjoy playing  Really  almost whatever it takes in the beginning is a ok  You can do it  I'm sober right along with you  If you're seizing  you can very easily and painfully die  You're going to die  Thank you so much  What a wonderful NDV    Good job     Fair enough  I've never tried it  so I don't know shit   I do identify with all those people desperate to break free from it  though    Being a slave to a substance blows    us recovering opiate addicts know exactly what I'm talking about        if you're taking it purely to circumvent withdrawals and not gaining anything legitimately therapeutic from it    Go to AA    I'm 27 and have been Sober 6 5 years  Best thing I ever did for myself  Listen to that little voice you pushed way down that says "you deserve better than this"  If you get DTs  detox first with medical professionals   Good luck all  remember to check in here often  there is no way I would be at 4 months smoke free without this sub   Haha I have had that happen a few times at a few different places  I don't see how it happens but whatever  I always take that shit back though to get it fixed  If they forget the lettuce that's one thing but forgetting the meat is just too much  Same  I was thinking of my New Years Resolutions and realized that I finally made one work  Almost 4 months smoke free    I got a cold for New Years and I was thinking this morning and bad I feel but also how much less worse I feel since I no longer smoke    This article can also inspire you  just START and go day by day    http   jamesclear com successful people start before they feel ready I reckon most of us have had our share of day 1s  I'm on day 1 again myself  A couple of times a year I decide to quit  and succeed for three months before failing  Almost every time because I think I can go into the bar and NOT drink  It fails every time  I just don't beat myself up  over it  I got laid off early in the year and went my usual three months of no drinking  and started up again around June  Only difference this time was that I replaced my 12pk a day habit with two Tallboys of those Bud Light margarita drinks  Not even enough for a decent buzz  It was mostly just to unwind after a long day  Well  I went out last night to the bar  Woke up today at noon hungover  and decided to try again    In my experience  the first week is the hardest  I might have a 6 pack of O'Douls to get me through the week  After that  it gets a LOT easier  No alcohol for me for the next 24 hours  Yucky much  2017 here I come   No alcohol for me for the next 24 hours  Yucky much  2017 here I come   23   thinking you have all the answers   an asshole sister indeed  She has some great qualities that I really admire and respect  but as long as she continues to float down De Nile  I refuse to take her bait when it comes to my sobriety  I learned to have patience with the ebbing and flowing of my commitment to sobriety  As long as I was taking the appropriate steps and using my tools  it was okay to have doubts  Vigilance and self reflection have been key   Same  This is so random but I screen shotted this earlier    I was emailing someone my newemail address and this prompt came up    To clarify I've never text you or text about you    https   imgur com 8IutADd  How weird  And then it hit me  This is dumb   I had that same ah ha moment when I was trying to make up all these rules to rein in my drinking  Usually I'm a much nicer guy when I'm drunk  I listen a lot more and generally care more  which is something since I'm already a pretty empathetic dude when I can be I think    Though I have blacked out and done some really stupid shit before  My problem is more that in the incredibly rare instance that a conflict does start  I go way overboard and don't really control myself very well  But thankfully I'm good at walking away or just avoiding conflict in general so this isn't much a problem   I have done some dumb shit like throwing my phone or smashing my laptop before while BO  That's always a fun thing to wake up to   My mom tends to be a very angry and very fucking abusive drunk   To the point where it did a lot of damage to our relationship before my drinking was a problem  It's hard to tolerate mean drunks I feel  I usually leave those people alone  I sure don't  As someone who has a history of hangovers that I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy  waking up without is one of my favorite things about being sober  Thanks yeah I was with family and the only adult not drinking and just said fuck it  Same old shit though  Thinking about the next drink before I finish the one I am on  I can't moderate and even if I manage to only drink two drinks I wake up feeling shitty and anxious  Just not worth it  It entertains  makes me feel good  passes time  makes dumb things interesting  makes conversations with strangers easier  What doesn't it do  Self knowledge won't save us  I knew what I was  also high functioning  straight A college student  got a good job in my field before I even graduated  etc    Then I stopped being high functioning and got chronic and pathetic  You don't have to bottom out  you can beat the system by quitting while you still have control  Life is duller but you don't have the lows  you know  I think if you're positing here  you must want to quit at some level  Good luck  Awesome  just awesome    well done x Right  Ends up I decided to not go there  We talked about it and she's cool with it but thinks we might should again one day  I'm undecided  Something worrisome though is that now she has decided to date this other girl she hasn't known and has never had a friendship with and is still married to a man but is in the process of a divorce and so on and on  Hopefully it will work out but thinking it might get to be too much  Now that she is sober she is capable of having feelings   and she has a lot of feelings  Very intense person when sober  So she is probably making a mistake  I don't think that girl wants to hurt her  but it may end up that way  Or maybe the opposite  She seems pretty smitten  the other girl  not my friend  Makes me think I may not should have broken it off  But I just have too much other stuff going on with college and work and stuff to have this as a constant worry   That always gets me   no one HAS to drink on New Year's  or literally any other day  Happy new year  Just remember that paranoid anxious feeling you get before you toke  Life's too short for feeling bad like that  Its your body's way of telling you something is wrong    Smoking doesn't fix anything  I know its hard but life can be enjoyable without it  Maybe go talk with someone like a therapist  Smoking and thinking negatively about life and your circumstances  is a recipe for a bad time  New year  new you  Circle of Death and videogames are definitely my favorite drinking games  I like shooting dice and betting drinks along with change too  Also I want to thank everyone for reading and responding   My wife is the most amazing person in my life  Words can't express the wonders she has done for me  Which it will still be a worry  but what can you do  I agree with above  I've been known to drink much more than the average bear  however I could hold my drugs and liquor  At some point in the last year I crossed that invisible line where I found alcohol in control of me and not the other way around  You can drink heavily for sometime before you realize your physically dependent  By the way  the physical dependence is the tip of the iceberg  emotional and behavioral maladies are much more serious and take longer to correct    that is abstaining for long periods of time  Havent been drunk yet so pretty good  You  Had a few beers but eating bulk so too full to drink much You're only high functioning until you aren't    and it WILL end  Trust me  Your story is so similar to mine  I am 27  Stopped drinking at 26  It wasn't until I turned 25 that I started getting sloppy  I thought I was invincible or special or just REALLY knew how to handle my alcohol    I always did well at work  had a great social life  awesome relationships  always on top of my shit    then one day I woke up to my boss slamming his hands on my desk as I had passed out drunk on the sales floor in the middle of the day  long story short   I still didn't quit  well I did for a month after that   And things got progressively worse  My advice  quit while you're ahead  Non alcoholics don't ask themselves constantly if they have a problem  If that thought is on your mind often  you probably do  I wish you all the best of luck and hope you're able to make the choice that's best for you  We are always here to help   Please speak from the I and do not challenge people  It's not supportive or encouraging   That's awesome  I'm at 5 months  my first one sober since I was 14  I honestly felt like it was a little dull  but this morning was refreshing at least  I was at a party at my boyfriends parents and did the same with sparkling grape juice  It does taste better at least  I got a DUI two weeks after I was hospitalized for alcohol poisoning    I didn't have an option to get sober    Believe me  I'd have rather gotten sober without having a record   This is really encouraging to hear  Thank you    I've been a vegetarian for a little over 2 years now and although my family is around 90  accepting  my mom and I still get into scream until your voice is hoarse matches over it  The moment I equated my sobriety with my vegetarianism was the day I realized that my family isn't quick to accept ANY changes  and that I just need to be patient   I believe I did speak from the I  That was apparent in my second paragraph   And I removed the challenge  Sorry about that    You have your opinion     Which is just that     An opinion  Do not bash others choices for recovery  It is a rule here   I decided to check out this post  as I'm currently about a week from the last time I used  h  subs  anything but weed   and I'm still digging on that lovely skin crawling  sweating all over feeling  for persistent problems with hyper hydrosis  try sage tea     I've seen so many wonderful and supportive posts within this community  and as I was already feeling rather low  I figured  hey  maybe this is a kind word of encouragement  or maybe this post will help reinforce my resolve  undergoing this scary  difficult time      Man  talk about a disappointing bummer     I'd never try to make any direct guarantees about what one can expect from particular substances  "everyone say they got fire    "   but I can say that those who advocate doing personal research  seeking immediate support  and cautious harm reduction are the best to look to for genuinely selfless advice  While I believe OP's heart was coming from the right direction  he skewed his message  espousing his personal mission statement as the best and only way to go  inflexible even in the face of opposing fact  rather than worrying about what's important  spreading knowledge for safe harm reduction methods  to help ease the suffering we all know too well  OP  I hope you have a good rest after your hard fight here  We are all on your side  but only if you truly  humbly want us to be      I wish luck to everyone out there  trying to make a better life for themselves  Mad mad love to everyone that has a desire to become something more than they already are  and I wish you all the courage necessary to make desire in to determination  and then in to reality  Mad love to everyone really  even the very salty and defensive OP of this post  D Please  never take any one particular person group's word as guaranteed life advice  tailor made just for you   After about 36 hours of manic insomnia  I'm not terribly eloquent  so i apologize for any dramatic errors of grammar  I've been lurking on this sub for over five years  never thought I'd actually post  but here we are haha     Find someone who has a recovery program you want and ask them to sponsor you   To what lengths are you willing to go to   I did and it worked out well  I think most people will swing between extremes a lot of times before reaching moderation    Almost everyone I've talked to brings my drinking up  saying "Oh thank god you'll be drinking again for  event  "    as if my drunkenness will determine the outcome of your bachelorette party   It's so weird  Like they can't enjoy it if you aren't drinking  I think for most people their lives revolve around it  You are so darling  and your face looks fine  You got this  girl  Don't get me wrong I feel loads better at almost seven weeks in    I mean loads better  I guess my point was that of all the threads I've read on all the different sites  I got the impression that after a couple of weeks you're done with it all and life should be back to normal  Where in reality it's a work in progress that could take months  But there's no doubt you'll feel much better before that  I think a lot of people  myself included  feel like they may never be "normal" again  when in fact they will as long as they stick with it and don't give up  I can say for sure at day 39 I'm no longer having the relentless cravings and that alone is a huge step in the right direction    You're absolutely right about kicking the habit in the beginning  It's tough to kick any habit and kratom has a weird way of keeping its claws stuck in you  It more or less becomes a daily ritual and you feel lost without it for several weeks  If I know what to expect  I can mentally prepare myself for what's to come  The thing with kratom is    every time I've quit 6 or 7 times   I've had a different experience  All based on how much I was using at the time and for how long    The hardest part for me has definitely been the mental    the anxiety  depression and fautigue I had for close to a month  I work long hours everyday    out of the house by 5am and don't get home til 6 30 or 7  I used kratom and adderall to help get me thru the day and it's been tough to learn to cope without  None the less it gets better everyday even tho I'm 40 days in   You can do it  I'm in the same boat  I will not drink tonight with you  We have ALL said and done horrible things   things we deeply regret   because of alcohol  You're not vile  Maybe your actions were  but you can fix that  And we are here to help support you  The guilt can be crushing  Try to learn to love and forgive yourself  That is such an important part of the healing process  Also  maybe try to attend an AA meeting  It helps to not feel so alone in your struggles   Drinking is a pretty sure fire way of making all of your problems worse  Including depression  Get to an aa meeting  be honest with people and listen to those who have gone through it and come out glistening on the other side I luckily haven't had the displeasure of actually being denied the sale  Has that happened to you where they got judgemental and actually wouldn't sell to you over it  Thank you  I have diagnosed alcoholism  PTSD  depression    borderline personality disorder  At five months sober  sometimes I feel like I'm never going to be happy again with or without alcohol  Your story inspired me  My HP is a universal spirit my dead grandparents  I too cringe at the prayer chanting  like less jerking off  Googling popcorn lung supports everything I said    And no shit it's not applicable to everything or everyone  No cessation method is       I used an IPV D3 with a Velocity RDA  0 5ohm coils  and a variety of different juices     It's common knowledge that vaping is   safer than smoking cigarettes     I know what it's like to have Drinking effect your job    I almost lost mine because of it  It's a terrible feeling  I just hit my 1 year mark as well  I'm so happy reading your story of success  Wishing you another amazing  sober year  You should be so proud of yourself     Congrats on your turnaround   I remember the helpless feeling    horrible place to be  If that's what it did for me  I'd have no worries  Kratom saved me  It allowed me access to choices again and the ability to rebuild my life  One year ago I was HOPELESS  I wish I had learned about it sooner but grateful it was not any later   New years consistently remains the most difficult holiday for me  If there is one holiday that really revolves around booze it's this one  I fell asleep at 9 30 and got so much flak  Glad it's over  Let the new year begin  No hooch for me  Right  I've also had friends tell me that I can't be pregnant at their weddings so that I'll be able to drink  I keep an arsenal of snarky replies just for these oddly specific conversations  I honestly didn't notice the first few bites  I thought it was a bit odd  but I kept eating  It wasn't until I actually looked down that I realized what was going on  At that point I felt sort of stupid walking back up to the counter  They probably would have made fun of the fact that it took me so long to figure it out      Edit  it was one of those small  1 cheeseburgers  nothing fancy   12 5 days in here and I'm using Quit Pro  I like it because it's easy to see how long I've gone  how much I've saved  and it also tells you some of the benefits that you should be experiencing as they happen  Also has some good motivational stuff too but you can only read 15 unless you get the full version  but that's no biggie OH my God I haven't had a great night's sleep in the past two weeks   and talking about being tired    I've forced myself to get up and get to moving so that I didnt ruin my kids winter break    I'm going to break free of this curse this time    Thank you so much  It seems surreal that I've made it to 100  Can't wait for 200  This time of year is particularly challenging for me with so many hours of darkness  starting around 4 30 pm where I'm at   Dark   cold   tough to be motivated to tinker in the garage  go outside  etc  The temptation to drink can be pretty strong  but I would rather be bored and go to bed early than stay up drinking and feel sluggish the whole next day  No but I work in retail and I've seen it happen  Usual result is someone senior getting called over and asking you more politely to leave  If you refuse then security is called  Awesome  Happy New Year   Enjoyed reading this  Thank you for sharing  Recovery really is an amazing thing   I use the Smoke Free  stop smoking app  David Crane   android  It has nice layout on the home page  where you can see how much you've saved  how many cigs you've avoided and how long you've been smoke free  It also allows you to put a widget on your phone's home screen which is nice   Misery loves company unfortunately   I fucked up  Threw out my ecig last night then this morning I cracked and bought a pack  Got two cigs in then threw out the pack and got my ecig out of the trash  Baby steps I guess  Two days in and still here  You have to want to stop  you can't just feel like it's something you shouldn't do  You have to have a reason not to do something that makes you feel good and that reason is different for everyone  Personally  I had a self reflecting trip on shrooms and realized that I was letting too many things control me  including weed  It's not an overnight realization and takes baby steps  just realize what is important to your happiness  If you want to talk drop me a pm I did not drink with you last night   I'm not sure  TBH  I'm not sure if I have an alcohol problem myself  but I fear that I might  At the moment  quitting is not something I can commit to   I'm also in the same boat as you  I don't drink everyday  most days in fact I don't  However  when I do I convince myself that it's ok  end up binging and feeling full of regret afterwards   This cycle has continued for me and it's a little troubling Awesome to hear this  3 months  Way to go  That's a great way to look at it  Good on ya   Whoever created that blog still needs to "launch" it  according to WordPress  Just remember  while it's good to stay positive  relapsing every 11 days isn't the same as quitting  Your next step is to be offered a joint by your friend and not smoke it   Congratulations on breaking through 100 days  Like you I'm a total NOMO head  I've been using it since just about day one  Those folks who built that app are really great people and if you ever have a problem  reach out and they fix it in a snap   Watching the weight melt away felt so great and with all the money saved on not drinking  it felt okay to have to keep buying new pants      I won't drink with you today  The only way to get out of the binge restrict cycle is to stop restricting  Just eat when you're hungry but focus on eating healthy  unprocessed whole foods   I struggled with binge eating and restricting and constantly lost and gained weight but since I have stopped restricting  I don't eat less than 2000 calories  the binge eating has stopped   It will take a long time for your metabolism to heal and you won't lose weight as quickly as you'd like  you may even gain some as you learn to eat when you're hungry  but in time your body will adjust and will let go of unnecessary fat  The first week I decided to stop restricting I must have eaten 3000 5000 calories every single day  no junk food   mainly bananas  nuts  dates etc  and I actually lost over a kilo in that week   Overall I haven't lost the weight I would like to lose but I have actually been able to largely maintain the same weight for once in my life  Also I've come to accept that maybe the weight I'd like to be just isn't realistic for me because of my body frame  I'm still working on it   sometimes I get fed up and decide that I'm going to restrict for a few weeks because I think I'm cured and won't binge but after a week of restricting I binge again  It's a cycle and the only way to stop bingeing is to stop restricting   Finally making it a reality  I'm done spending my time alone in front of my computer reacting to pixels change colors  feverishly chasing some temporary  meaningless point value that some developer arbitrarily assigned and will eventually replace  My in game achievements are not achievements  Sunk costs are only compounded regrets  not investments     No gaming  No watching streams  I understand that  I guess it's always just confused me that to her there's a way to rationalize everything  She's such a no nonsense  practical person otherwise  I guess I'm just venting  No matter what consequences come from something it never seems to matter  Is it possible you're mentally psyching yourself out about quitting and youre afraid  Maybe even at a subconscious level  I'm only asking because    that sort of mental anxiety energy exacerbated my physical state when heading towards quitting pain meds  Mental shit can really manifest itself physically    I'm also not a doctor  and you know your body  If something ain't right  go see a Dr  Wouldn't hurt     Great work earning that chip  I'm going to my first meeting tomorrow  any advice you'd be willing to share  I will not drink today   In fact  I don't even have any desire to   Too much other stuff going on  One year   High five Checking in  I have had some urges so far but not given in  I think posting will help me  You can still sign up January  I signed up for both  Let's do it  Came across this sub by chance  I generally lurk  had no idea this was hear  Things could be better for me  but I wish you all strong luck this year  You guys seem great   Still am homeless and hanging on white knuckled   Good job  We're all proud of you  I can relate soooooo much to this  For the first 4 6 months I let myself eat whatever as long as I didn't drink  Every time I had a craving  I got fruit slices haha  Man I love those things  Now I'm able to eat healthy and try to get my sugar from eating fruits   I've done the pour out thing too  typically because I didn't want to keep drinking   It always feels like a victory  and more often than not  it's because I want it to be a grand gesture that I'm walking away for good   It took a lot of times to realize that ending up breaking my promise to myself was a sign of dependence  I will not drink with you  either   Raising my water glass to you  though   My best advice is to plan out each day with activities and strategies so you don't unwittingly fall back into old habits  Sponsor not counselor   No training or approval needed to become a sponsor   Don't judge AA by single member   There is no real membership in that you don't apply and get accepted  you just show up  There are service boards  Then maybe you might have to increase water intake  Or do you think it's a hormonal imbalance  I'm only a couple days in  hang in there we are gunna do this  That's 8 hours you have back  it's yours  not alcohols  Don't give alcohol any more time  I mean  it just reads like an advertisement that serves as anything other than to benefit anyone but the salesman  Doctors and AA were the only ways I managed through immediate and post acute withdrawals  You've done good progress  You're moving from games full time to games   Youtube   Then you can go Youtube full time  then move to another hobby   Our addictions just move around  from games to youtube  then reddit or facebook   I don't exactly know what happens in your body when your brain goes from relying on THC to provide it happiness  to no longer having that substance     But for me  smoking was an escape from being sad  anxious  stressed  etc  I never actually learned to cope with stress and anxiety  I just smoked until I didn't feel bad anymore  So now  I am actually learning how to deal with life  My memory also sucks because I used to wake and bake every morning  and now my days aren't foggy  I remember what waking up was like today  and exactly what I did this morning  I can also talk to people now    Weed was always a way to feel less lonely for me  I was perfectly fine with spending every night with my bong on my couch  and now I see that that's just not what life is about  I realized that I enjoy being around others  and I enjoy listening to what they have to say and being able to respond in an intelligent  meaningful way  The subdued girl glued to the couch  having no emotional response to anything because she's too stoned to care    That's not me  I am on day 9 and already finding out that I want to be so much better   Im not exactly 100  clean but i woke up hangover free this year  Probs first time in 14 years  Saw this sub when drunk maybe a week ago and i swore id be sober new years day and i was  I did have a few during new years eve day but stopped at dinner apart from one beer at 8  Then drove up to watch fireworks with my son and cousin  Def sober drive i kept it very spaced apart dont worry lol  Thats a pretty big step for me even tho sounds shit  2017 going to be different  In a good way  That's what always got me   I could break it off  but the worry wouldn't stop  so leaving didn't make me feel better  If you're having a hard time separating from her  don't beat yourself up or force yourself into it unless you truly feel it's right  And if you try to leave and end up going back and leaving and going back again  don't beat yourself up  This is  hard   and struggling to get out of a messed up dynamic doesn't mean you'll never leave it  or that your life will never get better  or that it won't get better unless you follow a prescribed method   Big piece of wisdom I've been gaining in my struggles  if you have a hard time reaching your goals  maybe there's a good reason  I tried and tried to detach from a loved one  failed every time  then began to realize that detachment wasn't the way for me    and lo and behold  I don't have any huge regrets about the way things have gone   Not that you and I are the same person  Letting go might be a great path for you  All I'm saying is  follow the external information that actually makes sense to you  plus the intuition in your heart  "Following sensible sounding advice because a lot of people believe it" isn't anywhere in that equation  Nah  it's not anything like that  but thanks  I know what you mean  It is the best idea you will ever have to help yourself  I wish I quit or even had the idea that quitting was an option when I was 16  10 years ago  Quit  porn isn't going to enrich your life  It won't love you  It is empty sexuality  it is a waste of time   If I could go back to your age  I would drop all that shit in a heart heat  Use our inaction and hindsight to your advantage  Quit now and never look back  It will be way easier at 16  At 16  you've got to undo what maybe 4 years of damage  I've got to do undo the damage I caused my brain from 14   26  so 12 years of daily use or more  I'm guessing that's for if someone is sloppy drunk slurring falling over  Only if you give me a blue phat  Haha thanks man  D maybe she is just awkward and didn't mean anything hurtful by it  I do stuff like that on accident once in a while   This describes my issues when I was drinking    Don't smoke any more    When I stopped I craved sugar candy for a few weeks   Things starting to normalize now  There are a lot of nuances to making amends  One part of the step states that one should make amends to someone except when to do so would harm them  An example MIGHT be going to the husband who is oblivious of the fact you fooled around with his wife and saying  hi  I need to make amends to you  I slept with your wife  That would be harmful to the wife and the husband and their relationship  not your place to do that  It is ok to say  hey  I stole  20 out of your wallet  I'd like to pay you back with interest  I say all that because you may not be in possession of all the facts or all the efforts this person has tried to do to make amends  There is also no time limit on it  you can take years making amends    In regards to him being "nominated to counsel someone"   that's not how it works  You can sponsor some one  kind of a mentor for lack of a simpler explanation  and usually the sponsee approaches the sponsor and they come to a mutual agreement  There is no governing body who decides you can or cannot sponsor someone   It sounds like you have some serious outstanding issues with this person  Maybe you should approach them and see if AA has had a positive impact on their life  It sounds to me like you are holding a grudge and have not forgiven this person for the past indiscretions and are now trying to sabotage their success  In AA we try not to judge someone by their past  By going through the 12 steps  one of which is making amends  we can hope to change and remove our character defects  and become more altruistic and help other alcoholics    There are several reasons why somebody in the program has not made direct amends yet  They may not have remembered a wrong  a direct amends may injure them or others  or they may just not be ready yet   My advice is to just leave it be  You can only be responsible for your own character  This year went very similarly for me  I had 60 days and then started back up last Friday and drank until last night   I have been on and off this year but haven't really committed  always trying to bargain and find a loophole   Back to day one  Wish I knew how to edit  I should have said " make amends except when to do so would harm them OR OTHERS" "Hair o the dogs the only cure  so wheres the grog" quote from an

drinking  and I usually wake up super early and can't go back to sleep  Last night  I slept ten uninterrupted hours     She's not awkward  but I recognize that even phone conversations can get lost in translation  I try to give people the benefit of the doubt  which is why I didn't make a big deal out of it  Everyone makes mistakes  and I wasn't going to rake her over the coals for a slightly rude comment   Thanks   I don't like pancakes  but then I can say beef with butter  D  D me neither  High five   Thank you  I'm creating so many opportunities for growth as I continue forward  Congratulations on 274 days  My public goals were abs by 31st December 2017 and always waking up early between 5   7am  On January 1st I had 2 chocolate bars when I woke up at midday  So off to a great start  My secret goal is one full year without watching a single porn video  Still not yet watched any   I can relate to virtually everything you said here  I don't even look at myself in the mirror after a binge    You've got this man  We've got this  because really what do we have to lose  Porn  Ha  And thanks for taking the time to read and comment  It means a lot  It truly is  Congratulations on one year  Same  Such an odd feeling  I'm glad I'm not the only one   Ehh the withdrawal from kratom for me is nothing   Couple days of anxiety and insomnia and light  very light  RLS  MUCH easier than like methadone or sub   especially methadone   thats the most painful shittiest thing I have ever been through  Weeks of hell  but everybodies different  I agree though kratom isn't some miracle  Thanks PG  Your presence on this sub has helped me so much on this journey  What a truly wonderful gift that you are giving him  I hope that you enjoyed your time being fully present with your family  Continued success in 2017  I'm so glad this helped  The way I see it is that I am taking my life back from a place that afforded me an unpleasant  dark future  Hey  thank YOU for commenting  I felt alone spilling all of this with no one commenting so I'm grateful for every single reaction   How long have you been smoking   Do you only smoke in the morning   Have you tried other ways to consume it   How illegal is it where you live btw    Last week  I was on holidays and couldn't stop smoking  I got scared  so I decided to take the car and leave for a few days without taking the weed  First day is a bit tough and second one too really  but then it was ok  It's true  my conversation skills are not the same  my inspiration is not the same  my attention to details is not the same but I was still capable of appreciating life in general  even if I was alone  It's very reassuring to see that the withdrawal is nearly non existent after a few days   I'm scared of weed  scared of the fact that I may be lying to myself and that I don't really need it  Usually  these thoughts come when I sober up after a period of high  But the thing is  I don't really sober up  The introspection and behavioural change than happens while high stays with me to some extent even if I stay away from it for some time  So it's easy to think that I don't really need it when I'm still enjoying the benefits     I read the rest of the sub here and the main reason people leave it is because they use to run away from important issues  I don't think I do that  I have a job  I don't have a debt  I'm single with no one to take care of  The only think I might not be taking care of is my dreams and I'm not sure if they are best served high or not  I think it's worth trying both as long as i'm not losing anywhere else   What I find most difficult is keeping a workout discipline when using regularly  It's my first objective if 2017   find out how to do both   I'll be happy to keep in touch with you  just to see how it goes and how you doing  Same here  Although had a few beers  food and family stopped me from drinking much  My cousin had her baby on the 1st and my mum said "oh no everyones usually too hungover to care" i said not me n she laughed  "1st time ever haha" wellll its a start  I was fairly stoked after being a pisshead for 14 years  1st new years with no hangover since 15  Im aussie       Honestly  once you quit smoking you may find that the depression and anxiety go away    I like to search "moderation" in the SD search bar and read all the posts and comments  including mine  about moderation fails  It always gets my attention   I'm not necessarily sure I'm done forever   But I knew I made the right choice to take a long break when I had next to zero cravings to smoke once I stopped  Good job taking this step  We've got your back  Get the book off the side bar  If you can't sleep listen to the 'alcohol mastery'  podcast  Take action  Get on it  This is what I tell myself too  Makes a huge difference when you remind yourself that this is a choice that you have agency over  We don't drink because we choose not to  not because we can't  It certainly seems like you're worried about it  and you've said that you regret drinking    Perhaps you could try to quit for 30 days and see how you feel at the end of it    Only you can decide if you have a problem  but when I was starting to quit  I found it helpful to read others' stories here  to see whether I could relate to what they were going through  Turns out I could relate to just about everyone posting here in some way  And  I knew that my drinking habits had become uncomfortable and overall my life was very unhappy  That was what I needed to start the process of recovery   The label of alcoholic isn't important  I felt I had a problem when I was not able to stop drinking even when I wanted to  I couldn't make it 30 days when I was really trying  I would be able to give up other things I loved and enjoyed in for an indefinite period  like chips  which tells me I don't have a problem with those things   I am with you  Here we go  I will not drink with you today  I have gotten the book and just about to get started with it  What a beautiful show of support   The only way to get back on track is to get back on track  For me  writing down how cruddy I felt being hungover and the like was really helpful to me the next time I felt like having a drink   I'm only 22  heavy daily smoking for the last 4 years  and I'm getting this feeling too a week in  It's pretty awesome  At what point did you get the "extreme clear headedness" everyone talks about  Hey  it's a new start  I recently saw a few folks with whom I used to drink  It was clear they're still doing the same old  same old  and sadly  it was pretty obvious just by looking at them   It didn't make me miss it at all  rather it made me really happy for how my life has improved since stopping  This is yet another drug that a doc will gladly give u without attaching the possibility of developing a serious dependence  I got on it when in detox for morphine and poppy tea  nobody told me it was habit forming  A few months later I had a brutal wake up call getting on the GABA  It's frustrating  cuz it really does help  For me  getting off the GABA felt like benzo w d  Screw that  I'm so terrified of every single med drug plant now  Seems like I always end up paying some big price down the road   Thank you for your encouraging words  This is exactly why I have started writing and blogging  Keep an eye on me for future writings  Pub  Sounds aussie to me  Where ya from   I made a two page list of activities I want to do  places to go  restaurants to try  hikes to take  shops to visit  and I plan my schedule a week at a time  I am too busy to get bored  My danger zone is happy hour   get home from work early no plans bar time   What a cutie  And great job    Love this  thank you for sharing  Congratulations on 11 months and losing 40bs  That's awesome  I'd really like to hear people's response to this too   I find it really boring to be around drinking people after a couple hours  But my husband  and all our friends drink and he is not ready to leave a party after two hours  Or if we go out to dinner with friends  we have to stop at a couple of bars on the way home  I end up feeling irritated and annoyed with them all and just want to leave   or start drinking   One of my triggers too  Undermining my own fun  I would be creative on the pc  programming or drawing  and decided it requires a few beers to be perfect as I felt great    after two or three the "buzz" that is alcohol kills the "buzz" that is creativity  and replaces the void with indifference   I regret these moments   Exercise is a great way to boost self confidence and feel better about the way you look    bonus points because you get to eat more afterwards  Damn  that would drive me crazy  Your flatmate and ex sound like turds  Way to stay classy and sober  My hat's off to you  Word  No drinking tonight   I waited a month before masturbating  but I quit porn for reasons other than PIED and did have sex multiple times during that month  I think in your case you may want to wait longer than that  but I also think it's important to eventually separate P from MO at some point  The nice thing with separating them is that I found masturbation without porn or fantasizing to be far more enjoyable than I ever remember it being   Update  Talked to him about going to a meeting  he says he's been to them and they make him feel depressed  Counseling   Happy year to you as well   Yay for us making it through our first sober holiday season     As far as losing the job  at the time it was scary as I was the main provider for my household  Honestly  I hated the job  it sucked  i was underpaid and overworked and my intense unhappiness connected with that job added to my alcohol consumption  Losing that job was one of the best things that ever happened to me  It was the catalyst to my new career and for that I'm so happy  Definitely NOT encouraging people to get wasted and fired or use alcohol as a coping mechanism for their shitty jobs   I'm just happy about the way things worked out   I'm 22 and I havent smoked or ate or vaporized since December 16th and I don't feel any different  I still feel very cloudy and almost perma fried   I went for a skii today and I didn't cough out anything  In fact  my lungs felt great  I know there isn't any physical detrimental damage  but my mental sure doesn't seem to feel any different   Congrats to all 398 who participated throughout the year  You're all awesome  Keep on trucking in 2017   yup  not worth it  I had a relapse a few weeks ago and i actually had two hits of a joint and I was like nahhhhhh   Woah  That's really cool  Congratulations        good for you it's the small victories like that that add up to success I think you already know what you need to do  I know for me I like to justify eating by exercising beforehand  With that in mind  maybe suggest going for a walk run together and grabbing a drink or snack together  Also letting her know you're there if she needs a shoulder to lean on would be a good idea  Being a supportive and healthy role model  as Iroklife suggested  is a really good way to help her see what it's like to have a positive relationship with food  Good luck totally unrelated but your screen name is hilarious     Definitely  It will help you develop good habits and not waste precious years as a teen    Source  in 21  14 18 were wasted on things like porn   Yea  some of the worst angry drunks out there are just people who don't drink very often but holy fuck when they do    it all comes spewing out    Learn to communicate while sober or semi sober  Something makes you mad or sad  Say it  don't just bottle it up and unleash it once you've had enough liquid courage    Because this is what happens most of the time  you're drunk and mad and the people you're with are not going to be following your line of thought at that point sober or drunk    They'll just get pissed right back at you  because they have no idea what's even going on or what your problem is  To survive as a drunk you have to have some sober coping skills  That's a great tip  I've been having "moderation fantasies" recently  like way too much of my day is spent fantasizing about this   Next time  I will do that search and see what there is to see  Congratulations on an entire year  I will not drink with you today  I'm confused  What does from the I mean  And what's the thing with challenging people  Guilty  On my first overseas holiday  I got drunk as fuck off those little bottles of free wine on the plane and proposed  not for the first time  to my partner  The person in the seat next to me overheard and congratulated us   7 years later  still with my partner  still not married  Instead of staying home and ordering pizza  suggest you go out for a walk and grab something nice to eat afterwards  Exercise is a great way to boost self confidence and have a more positive relationship with body image  It's also a great stress relief  which could help and reduce stress related eating in her case  I totally understand your handover situation  On holidays in another country this was the only time i CRAVED pot  was when i was lying in the hotel room sooo hungover  Like a true addict i made sure i wasn't in that position the following night  but that's my issue   Stay strong im going to join the sober journey shortly  12 years is too long   I'm glad you're here and looking for help  You're asking for medical advice  which few of us on here are qualified to give  If it were me  I'd definitely see a doctor ASAP  I wouldn't want to face withdrawals without medical supervision   I'm out here rooting for you  Thank you for your words of encouragement  I feel like this time will be the one where I quit for good  Speaking from the I means speaking from experience  We don't give direct advice on SD  It comes from a peer support model of recovery  I don't know you  You knoq you  Me telling you what to do and how to think isnt what we do on sd  So we tell our story  share what worked for us   Instead of saying "you need to look at it like this"  which is an attempt to set someone straight   we say "I look at it like this"   The challenging part just isn't supporting  It's directly telling someone "this is what I believe you need"   Hope that clarifies  Yes we take this place very seriously  I know it sounds intense  but we've grown a lot because of the way we approach one another   I do that too  To numb my feelings or thoughts as sometimes I overthink everything  I used to just watch a good movie when I was stressed out  I enjoyed it    Now I barely have the attention span  and hate the thought of going to a movie on a Saturday when I could be home drinking  It's sooooooooo horrible to admit that    I loved going to the movies on the weekend  Now when it's Saturday  every moment is about when should I start drinking    The weekends have been the worst  as I feel it's an excuse to drink from morning to night  The past two months have been far better resisting the urge to drink on fridays and sometimes sundays  and I never drink morning to night anymore on the weekend    I used to be so productive  I would tell people that I could never get addicted to anything because I was so passionate about what I was doing    One week I counted the hours to be about 26 hours of the 7 day week being drunk  That's a whole day I could of been doing what I wanted    Congratulations   Sounds like you've had a great year  I will NOT drink with you today    Negativity reduces positivity  So naturally if you want a positive life  a lot of negativity will be reduced     I pushed a lot of people out of my life because I had such a negative outlook but now that I see how much better I feel without alcohol  I naturally push people who drink out  Not purposely but just because it's not attractive anymore  My best friend and I brought eachother down and I'm trying to help him come out of it with me  Exercise is what helped me start eating properly again  Food   fuel  No fuel   can't exercise  Eventually getting stronger   fitter became more important than restricting my eating  So in order to be my best  I had to eat enough to give me the energy to work out   Maybe the whole exercise thing will appeal to your boyfriend   Dude  it must realllly suck  I'm tapering and I'd tell u to go ahead and taper  but guess what  Tapering sucks too  You're a whole week in   I hope u can muster the resolve to just push through  It IS gonna get better  It's so hard to not know WHEN  U have to believe it will  because it will  Our brains do heal  All your suffering has been healing  Please don't give up  U deserve it   Very insightful and helpful post   I'm always interested to hear from people who break the big barriers  and 100 is certainly a  huge  barrier   It's weird  but when I read your post and all you've accomplished  I find myself practically yelling at the computer screen "don't do it    don't give in "    Congrats on your year  your post is inspiring and awesome  So it sounds like you identified a trigger for wanting watch porn  That's always a good first step  the trick for me is actually eliminating all of the triggers  I always find myself trying to justify why I needed to keep doing this or that  but if I have to argue with myself about it that's usually a good indication that it would be safer to remove the activity to avoid a trigger  So yeah  good luck  Do you feel like it takes you a few days to get back to normal    For me it's always 2 3 days after drinking  Then something completely stressful happens  or any other excuse there is under the that I use  and I begin drinking again    How do you make it sober a whole week  I feel like that's just too hard   I have been addicted   physically dependent on pretty much anything but stimulants at one point or another  From my experience in terms of withdrawn after effects benzos and antidepressants are by far the worst  Some things  like the nerve damage from the klonopin in my legs  I will have for the rest of my life  Did u stop the Adderall too  I'd think that any stimulant would make the anxiety so much worse in the beginning  I'm not even close to done tapering  but the morning anxiety is pretty intense  I think an Adderall would push me over the edge   Checking in  My dreams came back around day 3  but I've only been smoking for about 4 years and only the last 1 2 have been daily use  I'm so sorry to hear about your loss  stay strong  Hopefully your dreams return soon    Happy birthdays    Easy there  if you relapse you definitely won't be the first  or the last  I'm not saying let your guard down  but be careful about having a do or die attitude  It seems great when you get started  but I found that having that outlook just wore me down instead of building a more positive vibe  Worse  when I did relapse it made it a lot more difficult to get back on the horse    "Failure is simply the opportunity to begin again  this time more intelligently "   Henry Ford Checking in  The most I've been sober I think  in the past year  is probably four days in a row  I think making it to Friday would be such an accomplishment for me  I'd probably celebrate with drinking  To make it a whole 7 days  all the way through the weekend doesn't even seem possible    How do you resist the urge of drinking alcohol  I've been there too  I found Annie Grace's book is very educational and inspiring  Good luck to you  Why one last one  I believe your on the right track about finding balance  Seems like lots of things are coming at you all at once  Life has a way of dishing it all out whether your up for it or not  Ive found that drinking to escape from issues   isn't of any real help  Just postpones things ya gotta address anyway  I feel better as soon as tackled it and dont have to include my drinking to it  I wish you strength  and rewards   Sign me up It's already early evening here in Australia  and my usual time to have that first drink   I'm already not drinking with you tonight  We're not able to answer these specific medical questions  if you're worried you should speak with a doctor about the symptoms  The withdrawals are different for everyone   Got very little sleep on second night  Made it through though  Still hanging in there   Might sound a little weird but next time you get a craving take a 3 block walk and turn around and head home   Okay so it's six  Just stomp out your frustration in every step and breathe  Breathe    Pm me any time   Love that song   Stop attacking X mas trees  Why is there so many excuses for drinking  How do you stop the excuse making  You know how many people are going hungry  Come on ffs dont waste food  What  kind of reaction did you want here  Done with hat gaming crap   Temptation is still hanging around  but it can kiss my ass   Signing in  Keep it up pal  Just hit 22 days here  Take it as slow as you need to   Thanks man  I kinda feel they're mutually supportive now  the habits but also the quitting  We'll see  Good luck to you too  it's definitely your fault   you control yourself  not someone else   if she was drinking and pressuring you into it then it would be her that should smarten up Very cool  Only one way to find out  My wife committed me after a wild binge  which included paranoia and me saying some suicidal stuff  I had a BAC over 2 5  I am now over 3 years sober  You can do it  Get the help you need  I got a PTSD diagnosis  went to a therapist who specialized in trauma therapy   That changed my life and freed me from all the intrusive thoughts triggering that was happening for me   I also did EMDR as part of my therapy   was amazed at how well it worked   I worked hard on my mental health which ultimately gave me the strength to address my drinking   Good luck   There is life beyond PTSD   you can get there   I saw several therapists before I found the one that was right for me  and I also 'interviewed' therapists before choosing to work with the one I ultimately chose   Your mental health is so important so good for you for choosing to focus on it       With you on the nofap  Not so sure about the slogan lol  "Less fiends in '17" I guess has a ring to it   Don't mean to scare you or anything  but whistle in your breath is an early symptom of COPD  All the more reason to continue with this quit and make it last   But do look into it for sure Hi  Glad your here  I think of how I seem to have a alter ego when drinking  This person is tacky  rude  and well a just kinda gross  I'm not her  I have class and manners  So the alcohol really is my enemy  It persist in turning me into another person and I've had to fight for who I know I am  We know who we are  I'm so glad to be free of the misery   Still fighting but winning  Then we  get to feel better  YOU WILL   One step at a time      Congrats my friend  ARE YOU DETOXING   TRY HYDROCODONE   YOU'LL BE AMAZED HOW HYDROCODONE MAKES YOU FEEL BETTER DURING WITHDRAWALS   Why are we allowing this  Please only post when sober

motivated  A year ago I quit smoking  something I never thought I'd be able to do   so I'm feeling confident I can do this too  especially with a place like this to help me    "I CAN QUIT ANYTIME I WANT  I JUST CHOOSE NOT TOO"   facepalm Just try to remember that bacteria lives on your finger tips  and it has no business being in your face  Stay strong  Jail got me clean   Meetings   They will take care of you   Just the other day we went out with a guy in Day 4 of detox and we forced him to eat some eggs and drink coffee and he came back the next day and said he slept and he felt so good    we laughed and cried    social interaction   I promise  Day one  No real cravings  Though I am having trouble going to sleep     She was also the major cause why I became depressed and alcoholic in the past years  No she wasn't   It saved me a while ago as well   It's a good place  it all depends on how much she is taking   Nodding off does not sound normal unless you are taking ridiculous amounts    Being a little out of it does sound like Kratom   Again if she is taking it you have to know amounts for us to know if it could be a danger  Kratom alone is not very dangerous but one can get addicted to it    Good for you  Reddit   Seriously  in very early sobriety I'd spend HOURS  more hours than usual  on reddit just to keep my mind occupied  I didn't care if others thought I was wasting time  I wasn't drinking and that's all that mattered  As time has gone on  I'm slowly going out and spending less time on here   I still spend a lot of time here  though  haha    Any particular reason you want to quit  You do not have to spend any time with people who abuse you and you are not obligated to participate in your parents' drama     You don't mention either of those conditions  but perhaps they exist and you just didn't mention it     Alcoholics don't change until things get so bad  they can't stand it anymore   When we stop enabling them  sometimes the natural consequences of their own actions catch up with them and they choose to get sober  So one of the best things we can do for them is to let them face the consequences of their decisions     My parents' behavior did not require me to go 100  no contact  but it did require me to set firm boundaries  including hanging up or walking out when things crossed the line    Alanon helps me see where to set boundaries that allow me to keep a relationship with my alcoholic mother in spite of her continued drinking      How do I tell her not to stress me because it makes me want to drink   You don't   Removed   duplicate post Making amends is part of the "steps"   You don't have to complete the steps to participate in the program   It's highly recommended and you'd hear it spoken of in just about any meeting but it's not necessary   AA is relatively loosely organized and that's a good thing   It keeps it approachable and comfortable for people who may be non committal about getting sober   But it sounds like you have a grudge and maybe you ought to address it directly  Yes  let's  You'll get there  For me I definitely knew when it was time  That's what I have been sharing with people  You'll know when enough is enough " Only  16" It's not a healthy habit  no matter your age  Quit while you're still young  it'll be easier to kick  For me the two most noticeable things are the insanely vivid dreams and the lack of appetite    I smoked multiple times daily too and I'm about three weeks clean  only smoked twice in those three weeks but haven't at all in the past week and a half  and I'm just starting to get back to normal sleep   normal dreaming  Appetite is mostly back to normal too    Haven't felt much difference yet in mentality or moods   though  I do feel a bit less fried in the mornings  I wake up more throughout the night though  I used to sleep soundly through the entire night    I've heard people also experience sweating and irritability but neither has been too much of an issue for me    I think most of the major physical withdrawal effects will pass within a few weeks  From then on its all psychological   Just get though each craving 1 at a time  It goes away eventually I promise  Also go to the gym tomorrow  Run as far as you can before you have to stop  Go the next day  and the next day  You will be amazed at how much further you can get on day 3  By a week I bet you will be running further than you ever have   Actually being able to see my lung function improve made a huge difference for me   Made me think   LOOK what fools they are due to drinking    If they sobered up they could see how disrespectful they are being  I've been trying to turn around the respect issues in my home since I got sober   I was treated with less respect due to my guilt  Its changing I think you will see changes as long as you dont drink       Yeah I figured it'd be a month if not longer for me too   I was smoking all day everyday for several years and dabbing pretty heavily every night  Didn't help that I'm also in a position where I can smoke pretty much as much bud as I want for free either  I'm hoping once I get back into lifting and give it a few more weeks my head will feel much clearer  I feel this  Weed makes you feel like you don't need anything but weed to enjoy yourself  At first it's freeing because you don't need to go through the  hassle of making plans  maintaining relationships  leaving your apartment  etc  All you need is a bit of bud and the TV  or in my case video games   But then eventually you realize that's a lie  You do need other people to be happy  truly happy  and the weed is just inhibiting that   temptation will pass over time  hang in there  you've got this  This week will take forever  It's not going to be easy but you can do it  I recommend going for a run down your street today  See how far you can get before you just can't go anymore  Then tomorrow do the same  In a week you will have gone 5 or 6 times as far  That is how quick your lungs start to repair themselves  Some people say if you never drink  you'll never become an alcoholic   I'm not so sure  Your story sounds like mine   I didn't start drinking daily till my 30s  but looking back  my first drinks  like yours  were totally messed up including embarrassing behavior and blackouts   So I believe I was an alcoholic my whole life     my mom's alcoholism left me damaged in ways that needed to be addressed   She taught me some messed up priorities   Alanon helped me straighten that crap out   Perhaps if I'd done this when I was your age  I could have avoided a bunch of pain and maybe even the damage of my own alcoholism      I love this  Congratulations  Sign me up if it's not too late please Checking in  Happy New Years to everyone   May your Willpower be unwavering and prevalent in this rough journey ahead  Definitely excited to be here  After being the only sober one at a new year's party  which was still a blast   I drove everyone home  then helped shovel the fresh snow around our building  Slept in due to heavy lifting  and for once not because of a hangover withdrawl       Fairly confident I'll stick with it  I don't have much in the way of dependency issues with drinking  but once I'm going it's like a train going full tilt  so the the motivation here is to just not start in the first place  Looking forward to being healthier and happier in 2017   to have patience with the ebbing and flowing of my commitment to sobriety   I needed to hear this  Thanks    It takes a week or two  but eventually you will sleep better because you don't have nicotine racing through your blood  Day 20   There with ya bro   Physically I'm good   Tired  sure  but really just waiting for the opportunity to get to be me again   The way I'm feeling  never again will I fuck with this plant  Try the gold ones next time  I can't describe the taste    Carmel maybe   but yeah I can't any of the others down  Not necessarily   12 step meetings aren't for everyone   And some of them kinda make  me  depressed TBH  Fortunately I didn't let that run me off  because I go to some pretty awesome ones   I didn't go "Oh  AA must be terrible" just because I went to a weird group   He could have legit had a bad experience   I'd say try another one at a different place and time  Maybe an "open" one you can attend together if he's just anxious not knowing anyone there   Things and people change too  I attended several when I was 21 and I  hated  them  I didn't think I'd ever go back  I'm glad I did   The cast always changes too  so things are always in flux  Honestly new people always come and not everyone stays  I might like a group that I didn't a year ago   Then there's Smart Recovery and local support groups not to mention IOP  group sessions sort of CBT style facilitation  and if he's got insurance look into that  I had a lot of fun at IOP and it wasn't anything like AA  I kind of miss those groups       Then there's a lot of people on SD  reddit and IRC  with triple quad day digit counts that just get support online here  That kind of floored me  I didn't think "online" really worked   I volunteer for a site that has online 12 step meetings in the NA format  They usually push hard on bridging f2f and insisting online doesn't work  Some of this was later revealed to have originated from people who were not actually working a program or steps and didn't have a lot to say about the NA way of life  So they just parroted the same crap and it caught on over the years   But I don't know  I'm seeing other people disagree and say they're clean and sober and using tools here and getting what they need  SD seems to applaud whatever works  I agree    I'm seeing people on the other site get whacked with all the things they're not doing good enough  meetings  sponsor  steps  etc   I think some people get discouraged and just give up  That's not the only path to recovery but I respect that it's the path laid out by NA  I dont like the amount of pressure that gets exerted around all that and as far as I can tell neither do many visitors  Attrraction  not promotion right  SD is kind of interesting reading for me right now and maybe it'll foster further discussion about our messaging down the road      At least on Reddit I can say whatever the hell I want about all that    P I was broke as fuck ITT  Every CA Mother loses ttheir shit  I'm going to stop drinking as well  tomorrow will be day 1 for me as well  I might buy a couple benzos tuesday to ease the transition  and smoke some good weed as well  Really  I mean sometimes it's non stop  Just complaining and complaining   Really similar situation for me  too  Free herb because of the lifestyle I was living   First time being sober for x mas in 8 years  Thanks   so true about the hangovers   it wouldn't be uncommon or me to have a 2 or 3 day hangover   Thanks   the shame and half remembered incidents are hard to deal with   and when someone would tell me what I did I had no choice to believe them  Sign me up please Yuuuup  Definitely nice that I didn't have to blow a crazy amount of money like a lot of people on here say over the years  but that free availability was also a major contributor to how out of hand my habit was getting  I know it was time to take a break because I've barely craved it at all since I stopped  It'll be interesting getting back to real life after the holidays though because while I'm still planning on not smoking for several more weeks  it's pretty much unavoidable that I'll have to handle and be around bud every day for the next several months   I get the meaning  but every time I see one of these posts I'm like  "but I'm not drinking "  I am not a clever man  Heya neighbor  Sober here in MN  No booze  only water tonight  and tomorrow too  There are harder battles out there as far as addiction go  But a lifestyle change is much harder to achieve than abstaining  You have to change your routines people and places  If you only hang with people who burn constantly try and find some new groups to branch out  If for nothing else being able to achieve a goal of self control will give you resolve to make more positive changes  Thanks for the great replies   much appreciated here   For the next couple of weeks   r cripplingalcoholism is participating in our yearly

for the observed NY day for me though  Hey  thanks for the hint  I'm so sorry  mistakes like these don't usually happen to me  I was just very drunk and barely able to communicate in my native language  Not even close to being the same      Try reading all the positive stories sometime then point me to the positive stories of shooting up dope  You are a fucking idiot  Yup I'm a sales man that doesn't do sales      What's "julomte"  Is that a slur against Germans  I've always found it funny that the only things more varied than names for Germany  you know  Tyskland  Alemana etc  are slurs against us  The Polish have lots of good ones  Then again  we haven't been on our best behavior exactly recently  Yeah with that it's not a problem  I actually prefer I keep at it  I'm in pain 24 7 and it helps plus has other benefits and zero negative impact on my life only positive  What's the problem again  Hi there   I find it very difficult when I feel that I don't receive the support I believe I deserve  and it becomes very easy to use that as justification for my own actions   whether that's drinking  or being grumpy  or whatever   But there is only so much I can control  and there are things beyond my control   y partner drinks  and that is beyond my control   He doesn't know what I'm experiencing from day to day  and that is also beyond my control   How I react to it is not beyond my control   So  I try to understand why he might be frustrated with me  and why I get frustrated with him   I try to empathise with him instead of expecting him to empathise with me   And I take action to address my depression   I am seeing a counsellor  I take time to myself  even if that means getting up earlier while he is in bed so I can have some peaceful time to calibrate myself for the day    I don't believe we can change the people around us  but we can change the way we respond to them     By blaming someone else for my actions or my illness  whether that's my depression or my alcohol abuse  I am not only giving control over to them  I am trying to absolve myself of my own responsibilities   You have a lot of options at your disposal   you could decide to end your marriage  to drink and blame her  to seek individual counselling  to drink and blame yourself  to not drink and work through it     So many choices are open to to   that's a wonderfully empowering thing   I hope things work out for you  and I will not drink with you today  Yeah I'll try LOL   Are you a guilty pleasure type of drunk as well  I only ever listen to 80s stuff when trashed  I wasn't even alive  I was like minus ten for that decade  I didn't explicitly say you were  I merely implied it  okay  marketer  Not much difference between marketing and sales  They both serve sales  so yes  you are a salesman even if you're not making any money from it  merely for promoting a specific sales outlet with that URL  Learning how to be vulnerable has been extremely challenging for me in my recovery  I'd encourage you to check out some of Brene Brown's work  her books and TED talks are a great place to start   Vulnerability can be really difficult but is definitely an important skill to work on   This is amazing  You should be so happy with yourself  I went to one AA meeting last week  and will be going again tomorrow   It was nerve wracking on the walk in but totally worth it  I listen to 60's Classic Rock and 80's Classic Pop  hahaha nice mix   That song I ALWAYS listen to Life in a Northern Town  For some reason when its one of these its Always the second on I Play  Most likely cause my you tube on phone shows uplike that for pre viewed videos on my phone Watford are in trouble indeed   What video games   good work  I'm still trying to break the 2 month mark  You glow  girl     see what I did there     That's awesome  it's great to get that kind of unsolicited feedback  and to know that the changes happening inside the mind and body also show on the outside   Congrats  and happy new year to you  I find that I get a headache around the 5 day mark  Could be withdrawal  or could be unrelated  Your body is under stress during the first leg of quitting  so it could be stress related as well  Usually just whatever I'm playing normally that has multiplayer and we make our own rules for it to be a drinking game  Mario Party and fighting games are also really good go to games  What's your favorite 80s song then  I'm really prone to Africa by Toto   Anyway  currently off work for the next week  vacation  and just getting smashed ad 8 45 am european time  Might get some coke later  Just nice to have someone to talk to  I cut back on my drinking significantly since August with many sober nights and unless I have been very hangover I also feel sober nights are a drag and boring af  I try to go to the gym till late  stop by YMCA for a hot tub and sauna  then watch TV  browse reddit  SD can be motivating although it gets too much sometimes   Some night I try to catch a late movie or go to a hookah bar cause you can't drink there  I am "fortunate" in a way that I can pick up night shifts at work and this way avoid drinking cause I am working till late  Hydration isn't as simple as drinking lots of water  your body also needs supplies of certain minerals  such as sodium and potassium  aka electrolytes  in order to retain fluids  Potassium is certainly one that can be depleted from alcohol use  Ideally you get these from diet  but there are drinks you can get from the pharmacy that are specially formulated for the specific task of hydration  If you can't get to a pharmacy  look for some of those brightly coloured sports drinks with "isotonic" on the label    TL DR  'lytes  The same way I know that listening to Styx didn't turn your hair grey  music can't do that  No one can make you feel any way  and the only person who can make you drink is   you      Probably 99  of addicts  at one time or another  have blamed someone else for all that's wrong in their lives  I can't really guess at how many sober addicts continue to blame others  but I'm sure it's less than 99   Whether it's 20  or 80   though  doesn't really matter  What does matter is that those who do stop blaming others have a much better chance of making it  at least according to what I've seen   Best of luck  I will not drink with you tonight The trick is to get so drunk you don't give a fuck  Well  at least until the fear kicks in  It is strange that Your digestive issues are showing up at Day 15   Is it possible that You have caught a flu bug or ate something that isn't agreeing with You   I just checked out the side effects of bupropion and gastrointestinal issues are listed     Years ago  I was trying to quit smoking cigs and the Dr gave me bupropion and I thought I had caught a really bad bug  I didn't want to smoke cigs but I was so sick I couldn't go to work   I had friends that took the same drug to quit smoking and yes  they felt sick in their tummy too but not as sick as me  I went off the pills and my belly health returned   This is my second attempt at quitting weed   The first time  I did cold turkey and man  was I ever sick   I couldn't eat and if I did  I threw it right back up   I had diarrhea and cramps and felt really bad   These symptoms started on the first day of my quit and got steadily worse for about a week and then started to taper   That is why I think Your problem might be caused by the prescription drug      When I quit this time I seriously cut back on the amount I smoked and delayed my first toke later each day   It worked really well for me   I had one or two days at the beginning of my quit that my belly felt off but other than a loss of appetite and the need to stick to mainly soups rather than full meals    my belly issues are very mild  Long story short            please consider that it might be the drug you are taking and not actually the withdrawals  Huge Congratulations on Day 15      That Sissoko reminds me of a frightened horse on a frozen lake   he's so ungainly  lol  Newcastle is certainly coming back up   you've got a team much better than a lot of Premier league teams this season       PAWS     Ah  I wasn't really asking for medical help   just what people have experienced at my level of drinking and or substance abuse  Experiences and maybe some support and guidance is all I was really after  I understand that this isn't a place that can provide actual medical advice At the moment  Keep on loving You   R E O Speedwagon   Enjoy vacation  Ah youth is wasted on the young  Call me ignorant on the matter but the fact that she's in NA  has supposed to been off opiates for over a year now  and has never made mention of this stuff once to me  meaning she's trying to keep it hidden  tells me that the dosage or amount she's using doesn't really matter  Clearly she's being secretive about it and shouldn't be doing something like this to begin with    Under my old username I saw the saga  Fuck her  congratulations of the new toy to obsess over  it's always nice    I currently wait on mine hand and foot obsessed with the cock he won't allow me to handle  hoping one day I will get it again    NY is beautiful I have been there a few times  Got my first tattoo on some sketchy place in St  Marks place to impress a girl I had a horrible  HORRIBLE obsession with when I was sixteen    I can only imagine have a thousand tornados of real NY emotional all around me in the frigid NY air  You lucky fucker    I'm so glad you are doing well  I'm not sure this was you forgive me if I am wrong but wasn't it you who had the YouTube video of you dancing in a robe with your back like a vagina    It's been a lot of drinks since then    Edit  never had real ramen  what comes in it    B how did you watch the movie  netflix or TV  Looked it up and really wanna watch it  Thanks dude  I posted in stopdrinking  but the mods flagged my post as asking for medical advice    so that sucks  Mostly I'm just desperate for guidance from similar experiences  not like an actual withdrawal walk through  Edit  for example  your post was perfect  Super helpful  Thank you so so much  A way out and somebody to just like shine the torch in the dark and be all like "Hey  Over here  this way " is all I'm really looking for haha No more porn for me  i do not need it  good luck all  Well that's a pretty good one   Hey you're active on the opiates sub as well right  Good to know  because I recently got like 9 days off the dope  I mean I still shoot coke but that's better than heroin at least   Also which time zone are you in  Just unusual to have someone reply to me at this hour  I always thought it sucked this sub was mostly American  we're like 6 hours apart at the least  Character cannot be developed in ease and quiet  Only through experience of trial and suffering can the soul be strengthened  ambition inspired  and success achieved   Helen Keller  You're a fucking saleman  I prefer idiots  Ah  I wasn't really trying to seek medical advice  Mostly I was just curious to hear from people who may have experience with my level of drinking and or substance abuse  What to expect  Any sort of resource that may have helped them as well  That sort of thing  Thank you so much  Will do   Jan 8th is 9 years for me hopefully  Thank you   Almost 3am  Im off work for anothr week or so  Been drinking etc all day night  You know  What your gonna be doing  It's spam  I reported it  I urged using doctors instead and he called me an idiot  He's not a fellow addict  just an asshole trying to make a buck and not being forthcoming about it  You should report it  Alcoholism for me was a disease of selfishness  It did not matter the risks I put on my job or life  being hungover drunk for work  because I could function  People had a hard time discerning between the two besides the fact that I was more social  outgoing  and adventurous when I was influenced or recently influenced    My biggest advice is find a reason to quit  I ended up slipping on ice  bouncing my head of the sidewalk and saved by the police  I realized I'm just endangering myself  I didn't think I drank more than usual and I probably didn't  but things got out of hand obviously   After waking up in detox because of a high BAC  which I asked NOT to know   the doctor told me he couldn't tell if I was acting strange because of the high alcohol content or head trauma  Throughout the next week  I decided I wanted more to life  I want to have goals of travel  hobbies  probably leather work or wood working   and become the fun me while sober  Or at least find out the best of sober me   TL dr if you want to quit find a reason to quit  We all thought we were functioning alcoholics  He's a bizarre player  Capable of being top level class  just never bothers to do so    Look forward to seeing who will be joining us this window  Worried that complacency   the last thing anyone needs in the Championship is starting to set in  Rafa will know this  If I can do it  you can too  I needed a plan though and here are the main things that worked for me   1  Committing to 30 days without alcohol to evaluate   2  Checking in every day and writing these five words  I will not drink today  This has the effect of quieting the 'can't wait until beer o'clock' voice in the old lizard brain   3  When the 'just one drink' thoughts come along  play that tape forward  It was hardly ever just one for me   4  Dry people  dry places  I had to change my routine to change my habits  Going to the pub as an activity had to stop   5  Find other activities you enjoy  My 2 main ones are cycling and playing the trombone   6  Enjoy the success of reaching early milestones  A day  a week  a month  90 days  180 days are all special  It's important to remember however that each of us only ever has today  I might have strung a year together but I'm still only an arm's length away from my next drink  Thankfully the urge to drink has gone  so it's unlikely I'll be picking up anytime soon   I will not drink with you today      You are a fucking idiot    This is your go to method for convincing yourself that you have won an argument  word for word  You are the idiot here  insulting us baselessly  copying your stock insult  promoting a substance that has no actual basis in generally accepted science   Regardless  I am not even opposed to Kratom  I'm pretty tempted to try it  honestly  but I won't buy it from you  This is obvious spam  You'll be lucky if you aren't IP banned site wide  And these people want  15 an hour   hahahahahahahaha Haha  Is this your subtle way of proposing or something  Im a former CA and I run Ultra Marathons now  Ill run my

something I am very very familiar with   Before I stopped drinking I found myself lying about drinking a lot  and for no good reason   Lying about having dropped a bottle  so I didn't have to admit that I'd actually completely finished it   hiding bottles  pretending to myself that no one else would have noticed that I was drinking two drinks for every one they had   And I lie about other stuff too  inconsequential stuff  it made no sense at all  And  if I'm honest  incredibly important stuff too   And goodness me it is exhausting   But  we're here now  sober you and sober me   Not drinking today  so no need to lie   THAT is exhilarating   And it gets better each day   every day that I am further away from that sneaky  deceitful  untrustworthy person  I feel more like my real self   It's good  and I don't want to give that up   Take care  and I will not drink with you today  I feel your experience  My last drink was March 3  2015 at 10 00  Because at 10 15 I experienced a stroke  I'm 45  getting sober and trying to well while still trying to have a life is difficult  Self centeredness and ego is part of my defects I am trying to rid of  Acceptance of starting life over is where I started   It's spam  He probably doesn't even use Kratom  That URL he provided is a sales site  Report it as spam  please  I am going to cut and paste a response I made to someone else just now  they are married  but the general gist seems to fit here as well   I hope it's useful to you  if not  feel free to ignore it       Hi there  I find it very difficult when I feel that I don't receive the support I believe I deserve  and it becomes very easy to use that as justification for my own actions   whether that's drinking  or being grumpy  or whatever  But there is only so much I can control  and there are things beyond my control  My partner drinks  and that is beyond my control  He doesn't know what I'm experiencing from day to day  and that is also beyond my control  How I react to it is not beyond my control  So  I try to understand why he might be frustrated with me  and why I get frustrated with him   I try to empathise with him instead of expecting him to empathise with me  And I take action to address my depression  I am seeing a counsellor  I take time to myself  even if that means getting up earlier while he is in bed so I can have some peaceful time to calibrate myself for the day   I don't believe we can change the people around us  but we can change the way we respond to them  By blaming someone else for my actions or my illness  whether that's my depression or my alcohol abuse  I am not only giving control over to them  I am trying to absolve myself of my own responsibilities  You have a lot of options at your disposal   you could decide to end your marriage  to drink and blame her  to seek individual counselling  to drink and blame yourself  to not drink and work through it  So many choices are open to to   that's a wonderfully empowering thing  I hope things work out for you  and I will not drink with you today  Please be super careful and don't cold turkey    Know that a lot of what you're feeling is a result of drinking   Before I quit  I had a terrible case of panic disorder  depression  suicidal tendencies and paranoia    It has been a crazy ride  and sometimes not easy  but never not worth it    Life's great sober  and if I could get sober  then you most certainly can    Always here to chat if you need   What a huge achievement  guys   Congratulations  you inspire all of us   You've made several incorrect assumptions about my beliefs  That's OK  I don't mind  Just sayin'   This post is spam  OP's  not yours   Note the URL at the end of their post  don't go there  it is a sales site  I reported it as spam and I urge you to do the same and make your own independent assessment of Kratom without paying any attention to this spammer  If you think you can safely go back you don't understand addiction    The good thing about Europe is that it's so easy to get around quickly  I liked Austria for this reason  We were heading back west  then decided to completely change our mind and go to Eastern Europe on a spur of the moment  Doing that in the States would be a nightmare   Don't fret there's plenty of time to visit yet  If you really cared about people recovering  you wouldn't be such an asshole  Report this spammer  guys  This   sub is going to shit   subs' moderators are very concerned about sales and promotional posts like this  Maybe time to taper down  I feel ya  see my one and only post   We appear to be in the same boat  a decade of drinking  functioning but deeply unfulfilled  The going to bed sober thing    We are robbing ourselves of our most creative thoughts and it's tragic  Good luck  I'm right here with you friend  Going to do my best to stay sober 2017  Been sleeping absolutely terribly these past 2 nights  and thinking pretty much constantly about alcohol   We can do this  Sign me up  Yeah that's true    taper  lol what's that  I've tried the whole tapering deal before but just ended up slamming them beers Speaking of intuition   I just woke up from the weirdest dream ever  In reality today we were talking about how our boss had made reference to all forms of addiction as "demons" and while not religious she said that it really does seem like that is what alcohol is for her  The boss feels like it's a form of possession in the literal sense  but okay neither of us are really sure about that one  Where we work  I work 3rd shift and she works 1st so I see her every morning for a about 15 minutes and we exchange information so even when we were arguing and she was going downhill really fast and I broke contact outside of just our professional relationship and saying what had to be said day in day out   we held it together enough to do that  One day I did text her after work and told her she smelled so badly of alcohol it literally filled up the room so she might want to get a hold of that   whatever  Anyway  let me not regress  Okay  so    the dream  I dreamt we were in bed and I told her I was considering having sex again  She told me she had to go to sleep  So I said okay and as I was getting out of bed she rolled over and she had three mouths  The one on top was her regular mouth and it told me she was scared  the other was her vagina and that mouth said she wanted to and I was about to go through a major "shift storm" and the third was a demon mouth and it said "follow me" Anyway   I just woke up from that nap  It wasn't terrifying  but it was definitely not a warm and fuzzy feeling  Anyway  I'm just going to play it by ear  Another thing she has told me is that she drinks to not have feelings  That may have already been mentioned  All I do know is that since she has stopped drinking and the pressure has lifted we are actually having fun talking again  She's not the obnoxious drunk  or the sad sack newly sober  The second part just may be part of the depression process   Also  something I forgot to mention was that something else that seemed to have contributed to the spiral when she was drinking was that she started taking lexapro  That seemed to make it worse automatically   The epitome for me is when I try to justify that the price of alcohol  as if it's a necessary expense  but cut back on other things like quality food  I can't leave my command at the moment  I am on restriction  Not even suppose to have access to the internet  Thank you so much for this  The idea of not having to be that person anymore really is amazing  I'm not quite up to being exhilarated yet   Your words really touched me and I am so grateful that we are not drinking today  I had the exact same issue in the first few months  I wrote out what I was ashamed about  It helped a lot to spew it  Kept inside  those secrets would grow into horrible character flaws that I'd assume we're permanent  Talking with other sobernauts helps a lot  too   Remember  too  that you've been addicted to a toxic  mind breaking substance  The person that came out when I drank was and is not me  That's not an all encompassing excuse  rather a reminder that you deserve forgiveness even if you don't think your alter ego does  Hey friend  hope you're doing well  Only a full day in myself  best of luck  We can do this   I understand you're in a negative place right now  but I hope you will see in time that you do have options   The people on this sub are here and willing to offer support and advice if you want it    There is a wealth of experience here  and I find it incredibly humbling to know that people are prepared to take time out to offer me  an internet stranger  their perspective and experience    I am not sure you want that  which is okay too   I hope you get to where you want to be be  I really do  Why did you decide enough is enough after so long  Hey bro  day 2 here and very similar back story  We didn't come to this conclusion by accident  that switch has been flicked and now it's up to us to keep it down  You can and will beat this  You know you don't want to go back  You know how you feel when clear and when not  You've made the right choice  you got this     a support group might be helpful  Fair enough   Maybe you can find an in person support group using Google     once I get a car and can drive myself to appointments I'll look into the other options  My insurance plan  part of the Canadian medicare system  pays doctors  a lot  to travel to meet patients   They can do house calls  or maybe even meet patients in a park or coffee shop near the patient's home  or maybe even see the patient in the doctor's car  if the patient needs more privacy than a park can afford    Doctors in my country still generally prefer for patients to come to them  though  it's still more profitable for them in the end   Maybe you could get Medicaid or Obamacare   Maybe those plans also pay for doctors to travel     I don't want to rely on my parents to drive me  Are there buses in your city   If not   do you have a bicycle  Well we are here on stopgaming not gaming in moderation  I do have a gf  but it's not always possible to have sex  For example she's on her period this week  and I'm not into having period sex  Some people are    Sometimes she's not around  Sometimes I'm travelling  Could be many things  But since masturbation  in moderation  is healthy  what's the problem      Sign me up please I'd go after Will Hughes     I've said this before  and I repeat it because I think it needs to be said  The first few days will suck ass  be prepared for it  For you will be grouchy  sick  have no appetite  yet you'll be hungry    Eat small amounts of soup  or Huel   and have little to no energy    That   will   go away  The cravings will stick around for longer    I'm battling them at the moment   If you can take a few days off work  do  but stay in contact with people who know you personally  If you can  tell them what you are doing   Yeah Kratom withdrawal weighs so heavily on my mind  it scares the fucking piss out of me  The last time that I detoxed off Kratom I actually checked myself into the hospital phsyc ward   And I checked myself into the physc ward the time before that too   For me  the transition from my 'Kratomed' self  back to my clean self is really dark  The hospital gave me a safe place  and comfort meds  Gabapentin is amazing for withdrawal  Hell yeah  that  is  a victory  Reclaiming our bodies from the drawn out poisoning we've put them through should always count as a victory in my book  Well done  you  And congrats on Day 35  Have a beautiful day  Cookie    I would say they were just regular dreams  nothing special about them really  Once I quit though they turned into constant nightmares  A lot of them would actually be great ideas for horror movies or games  for a while I was typing them out but I ended up deleting it when family came to visit  Very rarely I'll have a nice dream  maybe like once a month  Five months doesn't sound long  Yes it does  You're killing it  well done  It is a great thing to be able to say these words to a group of people that fully understands what you are going through and what you are looking for in life  We have your back and you have our back that is how this works  I never considered myself an alcoholic and deep down I sometimes feel that I am doing this for my health and financial reasons  But the fact is that I have no use for 1 drink but would prefer 10 or more says something  I'm glad your here and look forward to seeing you around here   Thank you so much for your comment  I didn't really expect anyone to comprehend the scattered words and everything about my story being pieced together by emotions   I'm not particularly concise and sharp   I'm really glad that you made the decision   Your decision Will impact my life significantly  The bread was delicious  I'm starting a Keto diet soon  so I'm indulging a little with pies and cereals and all   I hope you feel neutral  and choose to be above that sometimes   I hope you feel completely whole  by yourself   Thanks again     3  Awww  you too Eligiac  do you know I had to google that word   it's lovely    Have a great day  Because you cannot survive on your own on less than that nowadays  It's called  livable wages   People literally cannot survive on full time fast food or WalMart pay  They can't pay rent or buy food or raise their kids or go to school even though they work their asses off getting shit on every day by people like you   Have a bit less alcohol every day to keep withdrawal down   slowly get out of it   Take a break for however long  before ya do it all over again  I was there  I thought Kratom was a miracle when I was  You'll hate it when you're back on the street again  trust me    which I'd bet my life on unless you give up opiates entirely   This was actually a little triggering for me  as the last game I played  I stopped about a week ago   was wow  But then  I also can relate to those things she said about needing an excuse to quit  I was never an advanced player  I never even got to that part where you get to the latest content and grind etc    but when I got a lot of in game money from my brother to kick off my new character  I felt like I somehow owe him and so I have to continue playing  Sunk cost fallacy  But then I decided that I can just lie that I quit only because I have to study   which is certainly one of the reasons  Also a couple of days later my computer died  so that's the end of the problem   Too bad she didn't point them here instead of r nowow  we're a lot more active  I'm so glad that you've comer this far   D I'm not even excited for reaching 15 days  I'm just marvelling all this progress   It makes me feel a buzz I lost in alcohol   I hope you find that feeling that makes you roll around in bed  too self aware to sleep in  Sing a song as you walk towards the window with a glass of water or whatever you enjoy  and giving the philosophical sigh that you no longer need a bottle of amnesia   I will not drink with you today    3  Oh for fuck sakes it's exhausting holding up the facade of being a normal drinker when deep down I want all the booze  It's quite freeing once the chains of alcohol are removed  It's hard but I can see clearly why I want a different life  Im glad you are here and look forward to sharing victories in our battle against the asshole alcohol   I've been listening to this all morning  It's scared the shit out of me  Thank you so much  Ok  so here's the thing now    now  WE'VE got this   D Thanks for making me aware of relapse signs  I have been craving  I do have alcohol in my home  Haven't done it so far   I hope to keep it this way   Thanks  I love you  I see where you're coming from   I think that any choice you make if you make it  is empowering   I see it as the difference between letting things happen to you  and deciding what course things take   I'm afraid I'm not sure I understand what you're seeking here  so I don't think I am being very helpful to you     I hope you find what you're looking for  and in the meantime  please take care of yourself  Alcohol is probably the biggest hurdle when quit smoking  Good Job  Loperamide is Imodium  As to the social aspect  it is well proven that behaviors are catching  both positive and negative  So maybe right now your entire social life revolves around alcohol  But if you opt out of that system and create new social events  you may find a lot of friends follow you  I have noticed when I do not drink  my family is much more likely to drink less or even not drink at all  temporarily    I doubt anime is a great idea but beside that I completely agree  wow   Yay  Isn't it wonderful that you don't have to worry about people noticing  and judging  your drinking   Cookie also said one of the options at your disposal is to try individual counseling  Counseling to help you work on processing your own problems and feelings can be incredibly helpful  even if your wife isn't able to be supportive to you in the way you need right now  Even just going to two individual counseling appointments has helped me enormously  It allows me to get objective feedback to put things in perspective for me  and a way to learn new coping skills to deal with my problems and feelings without using alcohol   The truth is  things  can  get better if you're willing to make some changes to your situation  If you're not getting the support you need from your wife  it's up to you to seek support somewhere else  But  if nothing changes  then nothing changes  Best wishes to you     Welcome Spiral   Stick with it  your future self will thank you for it  Scream you live off the generosity of others  Without that you are Fucked  I would think you would be in favour of living wages     Congratulations on a year and Happy New Year too  Jax or Mango  Sign me up please  Thank you for this  End of day 18 here  Hope you're still doing well  Great on Football Manager  but I think not athletic enough for the PL  He seems to tire easily then go missing  Also we're pretty well stocked in attacking playmakers   Benitez will probably make a couple of loan signings out the blue  Have a hunch we may lose Perez or Mitrovic though  No great loss  providing Gayle is fit  Yeah  that could be or it might be those random drug tests at work and the pot  which is still illegal in most places  stays there way longer  while the legal alcohol is gone in like 12 hours or something  Not sure  but I concur with your observation   To me  the ultimate drug are the good feelings the mind releases when you achieve things in life or do something good for another  I think I'm addicted to whatever chemicals are behind those feelings     Have you ever tried seeing a counselor or therapist  Congratulations  You are where I want to be in 364 days  Well done   I've experienced similar benefits to not drinking also  My income is up  weight is down and relationship better too   I raise my coffee to a further 12 months   one day at a time of course     Hey friend  might a suggest that you find yourself a good psychologist   therapist  I started seeing one a while ago and there is a lot of shit that we do   think but don't know why  My therapist has helped me to understand a lot of my issues come down to being very sick as a kid any carrying that trauma through teenage years and adulthood  I firmly believe that everyone should see a therapist  even for a tune up every now and then  We service our cars  computers and other machines  but most people never service the most complex machine that we have  our heads  I guess what I'm saying is  is that it's ok to not know how to do shit and there are people out there who can help  Hopefully that helps   Mango    I've used mascara and lip gloss so I'm in no place to judge and also hopefully no one ever borrowed my makeup in high school   Hughes could work in a sort of Pirlo esque quarterback midfield position  Benitez turned Xabi Alonso into this type of player at Liverpool   but I see your point    Hopefully you keep Ayoze Perez  he looks class   i am with you Don't worry about other people   Save yourself   Suppose it's good to see the CA tradition of wasting plant life is continuing into the new year  Thanks a lot for your advice  I will not drink with you tonight     Yes I did it     And man  I woke up feeling really good     Totally worth feeling shitty last night  Thank you so much guys  I want to be a mom too  a sober mom as well   You a're amazing for putting yourself first  to watch her become herself   3 Same here man  I followed about 1000  "Instagram Models" and scrolled endlessly through my feed and just be enslaved to their bodies  Good for you  Welcome to the club   Unsure to be honest  Taking each day as it comes I suppose  Any advice   Thank you for the advice   I am so determined to do this   Thank you x  Choose life  Choose a fucking big glass of soda  Choose driving in the middle of the night without endangering others  Choose a light snack while waiting  Choose an evening of good memories rather than a night of regrets  Choose knowing what you're doing every day  Choose community upliftment over self loathing  Choose happiness  Choose a programme that works for you  Choose jogging  Fitness  Longevity  Fun  Choose not waking up in public places  Choose not getting into fights you don't remember  Choose health  Choose family  Choose life   If it's right in front  could you try a headband look   I've tried   I pull right underneath it      Also  your therapist whoever is treating you sounds kind of lousy  Could you see someone else who might be able to give you a different approach   I had to stop seeing that one because she was a part of a program that I finished   My most recent therapist was absolutely horrible  he told me that BPD didn't exist  that I loved chaos  and that no one "normal" would ever associate with me if I told them I have PTSD  BPD  or trich    So now I'm looking for someone   It sucks because it's so hard to find someone who will work with all 3 of those   Many therapists won't treat someone with BPD   The ones that do tend to be in structured programs  like the one I finished   My most recent therapist treated PTSD but not BPD or trich   Last therapist treated BPD and learned about trich  but couldn't help with PTSD     but now I have a new spot on the back  so I don't know how much it really helped   I'm also worried about that   I always find a way   When I plucked out my widow's peak  I started pulling next to it         Your local meeting list     The January February meeting list for the St  Louis  St  Charles  Metro East  and Mid East areas is  here  http   stlna org wp content uploads 2016 12 January February 2017 pdf     Meeting lists change very slowly  but they do change over time   After February ends  future meeting lists will be uploaded to  here  http   stlna org find a meeting           Choosing a meeting     For the first meeting you go to  choose an "open" meeting  not a "closed" meeting   Most of the meetings in your city are open   Look at the parenthetical remarks next to each meeting's zip code   " O W " means that a meeting is open and wheelchair accessible   " O " means that it's open   " C W " means that it's closed and wheelchair accessible   The full legend is on the first page of the meeting list   The first time you go to a meeting  try to choose a meeting with a significant contingent of women and or young people   Consider going to "Women and Men Do Recover"  Sundays   "Women of Unconditional Love"  Mondays   "Young at Heart"  Tuesdays   "Hugs not Drugs"  Wednesdays   or "Little Girl Grows Up"  Wednesdays    You can search for meetings by name  and find maps and end times   here  http   stlna org find a meeting     Not all of the meetings I mentioned by name are in St  Louis   If you have trouble finding the room where the meeting will actually be  ask venue staff  or phone all four of the help lines listed in the meeting list   Or try phoning me   I'm not in St  Louis but may be able to advise you   I'll PM you my phone number   Or hang around the venue parking lot or the building itself   Look for people arriving  especially right before the meeting start time   Ask them where the meeting is        Going to the meeting     You can bring friends and or your boyfriend with you to open meetings  but not to closed meetings   If at all possible  arrive ten or fifteen minutes early  You'll be one of the first people to arrive  Say hi to people  introduce yourself  and tell them it's your first meeting   After the meeting  hang around and introduce yourself to more people   Maybe a large contingent goes to some coffee shop every week after the meeting  you can ask whether or not this is true   During the meeting itself  you don't have to give any speeches   But you'll be expected to say a one sentence introduction   Say something like "Hi  I'm Rockaford  and I'm a guest " or "Hi  I'm Rockaford  and this is my first time here "  If you're asked to speak any more  you can either speak or say "pass"        Conclusion     If you do go to a meeting  please let us know how it goes   You can make a new top level text post in  r RedditorsInRecovery or  r StopSelfHarm  then reply to this comment and provide me with a link to the post   Or you can just reply to this comment directly with your thoughts  Perez is good but hardly essential to the squad  Plus is probably our most valuable asset  15 20m would be hard to turn down   As for Spurs    sad to see that Gazza has gone loopy again  A shared club legend  seemingly back on the self destruct mode  The day after my brothers wedding he met him in a quayside hotel bar  Bought them three bottles of champagne after a brief interaction  Otherwise kept himself to himself  drinking quietly at the bar   Kinda sad  but also kinda awesome   Welcome  There is no universal experience but in my experience more often than not it only gets worse and goes deeper    You're still early in the process  Chances are your withdrawal symptoms will pass in a few days tops  Taper though or go to a doctor  because you never know  I'm not saying quit forever I'm just saying take a damn break    Or just keep drinking  No judgement here for that  But no  in case you're wondering  from this point on it doesn't get any more fun   Yay  Thanks for sharing    Back up after falling asleep early  I didn't drink with you last night   I am a first day as well  I understand your story so well  I just need to add the "secret" drinking part    Been drinking for 20 years or so  on and off  more on though   This is the first time i feel ready to conquer this beast called alcohol  With you and all the others on this forum I am reassured I can stop drinking for ever  A fresh new sober live     easier to NOT drink the first one than it is to NOT drink the second one   "  It's to keep track of how many days I haven't smoked  If I start on odd days I lose track and I prefer not to  I'm doing na and looking into a relapse prevention group  I'm going as far as possible this time  I'll work as hard as I have to  Ok  Then find a better job  Minimum wage is supposed to be entry level while you're going to school and what not  not something you make a career out of once your of age to start working by begging for a higher wage  If they work their asses off  they can do the same in a different field  The problem is they make simple mistakes constantly and still demand higher wages that surpasses a lot of actual important jobs that support and help the community  lets say  an EMT worker who on average starts around that same amount and their job is more sophisticated in that they're are saving lives    I'm not trying to say that I'm all that  I'm just server  but it makes ends meet  with funds still to spare  If you're not happy with what you do  as in not make enough  find something else  It's simple     Well done  I've enjoyed your posts over the months  and am glad as can be that you're Mr  Year now  Good on ya  Thanks  I'm in  Quit smoking most of 2014 and 15  was able to run half marathons and beyond as a result  Stupidly started again once I hurt my back and wasn't able to run  Yesterday was my day one again  That's awesome  very strong of you mate  Congrats  I put my work pants on after 2 months of no work and drinking   arrrgh  Looking forward to feeling slim  Solution   Germany has fuck tons of saunas  Go to one  sweat out the booze  take a plunge in the pool  then hydrate  Eat a nice sausage afterwards  maybe some pickled cabbage too   Reward oneself for feeling 10 X better with a few beers  That's awesome  I agree those early mornings are sweet  This is bullshit  YOU ended up back on the street after kratom because YOU were not done yet  Please do not project your weakness onto other people  Abstanance is your route to freedom  For some kratom is that route  Leave your failures out of other people's lives   But that's just how it is  Tim  Yes it all depends on the generosity of the public but that's my job to provide good and knowledable service and I'm golden for what I need financially   Of course I dont want to do this forever  I'm at least aiming for being a bartender  and even then if nothing better than that comes up my path  they still make even way more than what they need   No worries  it's always good to vent and your story was both helpful to me and I hope many other people who stumble upon this thread  Stories like this communicate experiences and emotion which can be helpful to yourself and many others  so don't feel bad for jumping in  I appreciate it  All the best to you in 2017   I believe in you  Keep quitting until you've quit  You can do it  Welcome buddy  Check in here often and keep the motivation up  Some awesome stories here to inspire you  Congrats on a YEAR   It's weird how we're left with these permanent reminders  like when you hurt your hand  I fractured my ribs a couple years ago while drunk and till this day  whenever I get a twinge there  all the bad memories come rushing back    I like how you discussed the advantages and results of sobriety  very inspirational  Thanks for sharing     Lmao yes  because the economy is excellent    I have more education than you and I work two shitty part time jobs and I'm still broke because I'm in a small town and the opportunities just aren't there  I don't have a family to help me out like you did through your DUI  Mine threw me out on my ass with nothing before I ever even did anything wrong  stole my vehicle  caused me to lose my good job  etc    It's not as simple as "just find something else"  You take what you have for granted     Sign me up  Congratulations BadToTheTrombone  I've been looking forward to this post   very proud of you    I'm in GMT   5 I think and up  east coast us   Attempts at moderation were nothing but anxiety inducing for me  Not picking up at all is far simpler   One day about 11 months ago I sat and thought about moderation  By this point I knew I didn't want to get drunk any longer  I'd more than had enough of it  So I tried figuring out what is so appealing about only having one or two drinks  It can only be taste  so surely it's easier for me to find non alcoholic drinks I like the taste of   So that's what I did    That realisation was like opening the shutters on a beautiful spring morning and letting the sunshine in  Hey TheNewTap   welcome  glad you're posting  and hi from Talie from the chat    I'm a teacher myself   I agree  it's a great decision  Teaching has become so much easier and more rewarding since getting sober     As far as "first days" advice goes  eat anything you want  Drink lots of water  Always have a tasty non alcoholic drink to hand in situations where you'd usually have been consuming alcohol  Check in with your doctor if you're at all worried  I see you're doing that   good call     Be kind to yourself  Do what you need to do to get through  B vitamins might be a good idea  And as you know   hop into the chat if you need to talk about anything at all    Enjoy that art gallery  and congratulations on getting started    Talie PLANTS  I LIKE THEM   Congratulations  Here's to 5 months more   i'm in my 15th day still have dizziness gerd but the depression have greatly reduced compared to the 1st and 2nd week  my doc give me dogmatil 3 days ago and my stomach starting to calm down but still can't find solution for my dizziness and fatigue I read Pants  Hope you wear them  Fantastic  you must feel amazing  wishing you an even more amazing year   Please only post when sober   this is explained in the  participation guidelines  https   www reddit com r stopdrinking wiki index wiki post only while sober   for this subreddit     We recognize that many people spend months "lurking" this subreddit while drinking  You are welcome to read as much as you'd like while not sober  However  for the sake of everyone here  and for the sake of your own recovery  please only post or comment when you're sober  "Sober" means "not currently intoxicated or under the influence in any way "  In the meanwhile  there's lots of information in the posts here and lots to explore in the sidebar    You are so  so young and so  so sheltered  Not everyone has had everything in life handed to them  You don't realize that it isn't always a question of "work harder" or "get a better job " Better jobs take degrees or experience  which costs money and takes time that people can't always afford  I'm not going to waste more time talking to you about this because i know that you won't get it    I really hope that your life continues swimmingly and that you're never forced to lower yourself because thats all that is available to you  But on the other hand  you'll be a spoiled brat until you die unless that happens  So I'm torn   I haven't posted in awhile  but shit this sub is getting weak  What happened to chairs and promoting horrible life decisions  Where the fuck are the regulars  Good job  I'm planning to quit in a couple of weeks  Meanwhile  I need to figure out if I need to keep alcohol on hold or figure out ways to manage not smoking while drinking  Pussy is pussy We are with you Anongrl9  Take care of yourself  seek help if you need it   I'm not drinking with you today    Why  I hate pants   Isn't that so weird          Nooo  gets down on one knee and opens a beautifully crafted wooden box of booze  Hi   I'm a lurker who started posting today too  I also found this sub extremely helpful during my drunken days  It's doubly so during sobriety  Quitting was always a "one day" goal in the back of my mind  one day I'd register and get my badge  until life bitch slapped me and said  "No   now " I hope you're able to stop drinking before it bites you  My experience is that it will bite you eventually  Thank you  Story of my life  Longest I have gone is 18 months   Motivators for me are thinking about how shit I feel the next day  how I will waste it  probably cancel on someone  Weight lose photos and progress  buying new clothes  even blokes like to feel good  gym  outdoor adventures and just all round be ready to rumble with life and say Yes more often  I've been working towards quiting again for some months  this is it  done deal  We got this  same problem here at 24  badge reset after nye  if u are anything like me then all of your mates are heavy drinkers too and don't "understand" why i want to quit  drinking is their  and was my  normal  its hard but we can do it  I get that a lot actually  the Negasonic Teenage Warhead look   thanks  Yes indeed  it really is exhausting and alcohol is an asshole  There are atheist agnostic freethinkers meetings  Do a search for "waaft" or "aaagnostica "   Founder Bill realized later in life that he'd overdone the religious language  and said so  The book  of course  was never changed to reflect that   I'm with you  I've tried so many times to get sober in the past  I had forgotten it had even happened  but over the holidays my brother reminded me of how in October I called him drunk and depressed  saying I was sick of living    I drank on NYE  Alone  I had a 6 pack of beer to myself  I wondered what the hell I was even doing  it wasn't fun  There was no reason for it  alcohol has not done anything but destroy my life  I didn't want to be around anyone  and told everyone I was just relaxing and watching movies alone  wasn't in the party mood  But for some reason still wound up buying beer  Who does that   So yeah  for today  it's 2 30 AM here  I won't drink with you   Nope  Have had several talks about it  Best talk I've ever had about it  with regard to my parent taking some responsibility and admitting his drinking is problematic  was when I finally admitted  reluctantly  that I think I am an alcoholic and need to stop drinking  Who knew  That's one of the things I love most about SD   we have more than 55K in our army going strong  and we're there for each other each and every day  The support  kindness  sincerity and genuine compassion is incredible here   Congrats on 492 days Shine  and thank you for your friendship and kind words  Blessings to you always       Shout out to u ninjilla   many thanks for this and for all of your support and encouragement   my doctor put me on lexapro  it was a night and day change  also if you have a constant anxiety try the phone app calm com  it's free and very effective I'd recommend not fucking with xanax man  Shit fries your brain  Good on you for questioning what's going on  I know a lot of teachers and drinking is high on the cards for many being a problem  a glass here  bottle there    often  Often I'll hear a couple of them say they want to have a break  but never do  Seeing your GP is a great idea  I'm a nurse and have similar drinking habits  I found identifying the time I like to drink 4 7pm start I need to do something else  gym  youtube  family stuff  cleaning  fishing  just to break that habit time  frame  It's only day 2 for me  but i've been working towards this moment for a couple months now  Once I turned up to work still affected  it was the worst  highly embarrassing  Write your goals of why and what motivates you to succeed   Some great points from taliesinsmuse   Aww I'm so glad it did  I'm scared of my weakness  Right now I'm full of determination and visualising how my life can be sober  going for nice walks  painting again  doing my poi etc  but I know it's just one stupid moment to be back again  Hopefully I can get medication or something to help  Or find my strength here from people like you    Nice  it's so easy to see the difference sometimes  You gotta tell me about the whiteboard though  Thanks  But if I may ask  what do you think is wrong with anime  He said in his post it was something he liked  Yeah it's really bizarre  Still  feel free to hop on my sublime username      Can you remind me of my Santa's name  I have the address  and am looking for what to send them    Brings two large glasses into the room  I believe the link in the FAQ regarding non alcoholic beer is broken  It went to page not found on my Reddit mobile app  Won't get it  I totally get it  Everything that I have right now had a price to pay  losing my mom and our house I'm still fucked up from the that  Ive since been forced into the adult world  working as much as I can to make ends meet  Yes  I was spoiled when she was alive  I would get my shifts covered just so I can sit around and drink  but its a lot different now  And I'm trying to adult as best as I can  I actually pick up shifts rather than releasing mine  I honestly don't know why you keep lashing out on me  Fash   If we're not cool anymore  so be it  Hey Liverrot   this is the hardest part   and you're doing great   A minute at a time  whatever it takes  Please keep checking in  we're here for you  And I'll keep cheering you on      You're in the best place here  It seems like the whole world is drunk sometimes and having fun but you don't see the other side of it  You can message a mod for your day 1 badge and watch that number grow  and you can consider looking for other resources like counselling or AA which are helpful to some as well  I'm still reflecting on day 119  Only now  I can see many more possible and exciting paths  I've got the time and am building the discipline now to travel those paths that would've been impeded or fully blocked by a bottles of whiskey  mountains of whiskey  Best of luck to you on Day 2  You can do it  Sorry  I must not have been clear   I do take pride in the days behind   But it is the day now and the days to come where we need to focus     Congrats on your 22  Thought you may raise this  Undergarments  not trousers  If you don't it'll get chilly down there   Shouldn't you be asleep anyway  Must be what  4am where you are  Congrats  man  Great work  Washed AND waxed the car this morning  made a great breakfast  read some more of my book  and knocked out The NY Times Sunday crossword  Odd to think none of this would have been possible over any of the last twenty or so January 1's    I got a little chuckle listening to the drunk hangover tales of my friends and neighbors this morning  No thanks  Ouch   Hey Bone   Congratulations on a YEAR  As you know  I've been eagerly awaiting this post  and no  I can't hold my horses any longer lol    I read your DCI and comments every single day and I thank you for all the support and encouragement  It's a pleasure to celebrate this awesome milestone with you   raising my coffee and sending a big warm hug your way      Welcome   I'm not sure how good my advice is  but I have found that posting here  seeking and lending support  is helpful along with managing progress one day at a time   To that end  I use the daily mantra of Not Today   Good luck and welcome  Congrats on 54 days  Turtle  That's wonderful      I'm sorry for your loss  I really admire your strength in getting through this anniversary of your loved one's death  and that heartbreaking phone call  I am proud of you for getting out and seeking the support you needed  instead of giving in to sadness  or drinking again  Thank you for sharing this  Best wishes to you     Once those feelings aren't pushed down by alcohol they really make themselves known  I think I cry almost every day  thinking about what I could have done differently  where I'm going to go from here  who I actually am  But that's something I'd just be pushing down the line otherwise  You can do it  and you don't have to do it alone  your chances are pretty good now that you're here  Awesome  was unsure if dog or woman before picture loaded  then  both  Illusion of joy   You nailed it right there mate  For me drinking also made things fun  magical  awesome   reality is  no  it was the same and I'd be left deflated at the end of the drinking session and then knowing the consequences the following days with lowered mood and anxiety   Keep being honest with her  after all there's a reason you guys are together and encourage her to support you and maybe even encourage her to read about anxiety in others to get some insight it's not just you  but very common   You brought tears to my eyes  A really inspiring read  Many best wishes to you on you ongoing recovery  Will gladly not drink with you  Nice work  was a little hesitant to ask for mine at a meeting but once I had that cheap little scrap of metal in my hand it did something for me  Its just so frustrating when i hear you say stuff like fast food should be a job  while you go to school  not realizing that not everyone can afford the luxury of higher education  Some people are even forced to drop out of HIGH school to make money for their families  And before you say rhat that's because their parents are lazy  please consider that maybe their parent or parents are sick and have no health insurance because this country treats its people like shit  Or maybe they grew up in foster care and have no family to help them  Or maybe they caught some trumped up charge that makes it very very difficult to even get a good job  I just don't see you even understanding that lufe is like that for way more of the population than you'd think  And it seems to me that you think it's just a matter of "working harder" to overcome a system that is built to keep people down and to reward those on the top who do not need the help    It's ignorant and blind and honestly it is insulting  I don't know how i can show you how life is really really hard for so many people  not things like one or two bad events  but a systemic assault that beats people down day after day after day  That sounds delightful   Question though   isn't pickled cabbage just sauerkraut  PM me with your city and I'll get you in contact with your local 24hr hotline for CA or NA Good point   that next day feeling like shit  letting yourself down  letting others down   that's enough  I'm out  quit now  Hi Stillmuddy  Hang in there   if you've been sober long enough to forget how long it's been  then you're doing incredibly well  I can't pretend to know how you're feeling at this point  but it sounds like you're experiencing ennui and some degree of depression  Drinking isn't going to make that better   From where I'm standing  it seems like the best thing would be to talk to your boyfriend about what you're feeling   at the very least he might be able to accompany you to some new groups until you find somewhere comfortable    I dislike using kraut when conversing with a German  It's bad manners  It get easier  Don't lose hope  nice  Very Trainspotting    We have a white board in the kitchen  If we had heated arguments I usually was the first to fall asleep  intoxicated  and she would write her final say on there  For the longest time  when I drank alcohol  I loathed that board  Now it is usually filled with normal stuff  occasional praises hugs and kisses  Wow  that's awesome  If only I had half a brain at 24 to quit then  now 35  Congrats  Lost all your possessions  What happened  Congratulations on a year  Thanks for sharing the great news      You mentioned your age  so I'm curious if this has to do with most of the people in the meetings being older  I'm 21 and have been sober for 20 months  I got involved pretty early with YPAA  Young People in Alcoholics Anonymous   It's been a great way to meet other young people  They may also have young person's meetings where you live  I would get a hold of your Intergroup  or ask around at local clubhouses   I sometimes find it easier to share at candlelight meetings  The lack of light takes away the pressure of people staring at me   Sharing has also been difficult for me  but I've gotten more comfortable with it  The only way I found was to start short  I introduced myself as an alcoholic and then just passed  Slowly as I built some knowledge and confidence  I could add more   e  typed more That's awesome to hear   It's great for you in ways beyond just staying free   Keep going   Not today  My first 3 days were characterised by the constant feeling of missing having lost something   Don't lose hope  it gets easier  Use some willpower and prove it to yourself  Congrats on deciding to make changes for the better  Day 1 sure  does  suck  but not as bad as continuing to wake up hungover and broke sucks      I'm glad you have made plans to have lots of support going forward  bc that might just be the most important thing you could do to help you make lasting changes   Being able to enjoy your life again is absolutely worth all of the effort it takes  Looking forward to seeing you around here  and hearing about your progress  Best wishes to you     I drunkenly fell into some sort of a planter at a party I was not really invited to but tangentially showed up at on NYE  I didn't know that wasting plant life was a CA thing but glad I'm not alone    I've also killed every plant I ever owned  But  that's not as much a CA thing   The great thing is that you don't ever have to feel like this again  Happy new year  Ha interesting  Certainly could have used some better communication in my last relationship  Hey sorry you're having to deal with stressful stuff like this  I guess this is life  Good thing is you're trying to reach out to others  What kind of emotional support do you have  Can your dad help you find a therapist just so you can learn copying skills  It also helps just to have someone to talk to without them being judgemental  Anyway  I hope things get better for you  But hang in there in the meantime  I'm an atheist  What I get from AA is comfort from other people who understand my struggle  That's it  Take comfort in knowing we all struggle   Yet  we all  including you  have the power to overcome this struggle   I work on it one day at a time through the simple declaration of 'not today'    Have I stumbled   Certainly  but I think I'm becoming stronger and hopefully have identified triggers and 'defensive actions' that I can take to stem urges   Stay strong   You've got this  Haha  'Wow you look great '   'Not really  I just don't look like crap ' Nice work on keeping your streak going  Plastic wrap and a blow torch   Lol  love it  That's awesome   congrats on the success  Good job   During my first week of quitting I drank  I told myself if I get use to it at home now it will be easier when I'm outside later on   I've gotten smashed twice in a bar and didn't smoke  I guess it worked  I called this technique "quitting on hard mode"  Cacti  One of mine is 18 years old   fucking enormous now  Requires next to no care  and isn't easy to set alight  Perfect CA plant  oh just being wasted and lost a bag full of stuff somewhere  passport  keys  bank card  money  make up  clothes  my book etc     i dont a flat and i move around a lot   genuinely this is basically all i own   You can do it  thanks  yeah i am actually feeling the sense of excitement peace that annie grace was talking about  i can see more firmly than ever how breaking my sobriety for the same old night out was a waste of time   Sucks that you had to feel that  you never know when you will get tested  Hah I'm not religious at all but I can feel that vocabulary and mode of thought seeping in  Good stuff keeping on through the new year  What kind of business are you running  hey  wow congrats  do you have any tips from one 24 yo woman to another  x wow well done  congrats  you're doing great     Congrats to you BadtotheTrambone  happy 2017 Congrats  Here we go for another one   Thank you  I mean today would have been no better if I wasn't sober  The hangover was happening either way haha  Hopefully it's my last though   What it doesn't do is make spending time with anyone who knows or cares about you easy or even tolerable for them  Strangers just see the "hey  he's a party guy" side and don't care any deeper  The people who know you get to watch you not give a shit about them or yourself again as you hide behind the alcohol buzz   Having said all that I do know that from your perspective  it ain't easy to face up to any of this shit when you're caught in a spiral of drinking  Ultimately you'll need to make the decision if this is how you want to live your life or if you want to change and escape the drinking  You don t need any help to drink but you will need some when you decide to give it up  even if it is just to fill in the boredom with other options  Good luck either way    Duck I'm right here   It's 3am and I just finished my liter of vodka   Woke up wasted yesterday morning at a friend's house   I was naked from the waist down in a random bedroom   Found my jeans which were soaked and I don't remember why   Vaguely remember falling down in the snow   I think   I've got the nastiest cut on my ass   Apparently we were at someone's house and there was a glass shelf that broke   The only reason I know this is from messaging  with a guy that I was with last night   He's trying to piece the night together as well but he was BO too   I'm pretty certain we had sex as I'm sore but neither one of us remember   All I could do was congratulate him for getting it up while BO   He found that hard to believe but cheers to getting awesome last night   Only plus side was I danced my ass off and stayed local so I had nonjudgmental friends around me that could make sure I was safe   And when getting home I found the liter of vodka that I stashed from the previous night so I could just stay drunk all day   Love just laying in bed and cuddling with a bottle of vodka all day   Now if I could just remember the sex     Oh well   Chairs ducker  There is actually a huge difference between pickled cabbage and Sauerkraut  Well actually there isn't  Sauerkraut is just pickled in a different way   Are you from one of those German states like Wisconsin  Cause if so  I could go on a rant right now  Hi once lost  Congratulations on 5 months  So proud and happy for you      Most depressing bullet point sheet read ever      Now that you've hit the ultimate low point of your life  maybe you can look forward to the rest of your life and think   it can only be BETTER from now on   It's a long walk  but you can get there  you're not exactly alone in that walk   so    let's make 2017 awesome  The year that made ALL the difference   I'm not drinking with you today  Ok  Tea perhaps  but non alcoholic          Where the fuck are the regulars   Are you really wondering where the regulars of an alcoholism subreddit could have possibly gone  Congrats  Art is much better sober  Well they both sound delish   And yes I'm from Minnesota   Land of 10 000 lakes and completely populated by Germans  Scandinavians and Indians  and on your year too KP  well me and my dad have been talking about this  and I've also got a friend who is really supportive  And it's just that finding a therapist seems a bit rough to me   I'd just want like a friend or someone here to talk to who can understand my situation  While I know that a therapist may know how to do their job it's just that it doesn't feel right to me  thanks for your reply  it means a lot  Haha I love your name  I've been drinking it for years now  but I imagine I might start drinking even more of it now   Well  consider your life is getting a new clean slate  pretty much like your wallet  and most peoples wallets this time of the year     Time to earn new powers  feeling just better every day  We'll have a few setbacks like the flu or the common cold biting us once in a while  but the power to stick with it and let nature do it's thing is within us  and we will come out winners later on    I am glad you took the plunge for a better life too   Welcome to a sober 2017  Thank you  Thank you    D Thanks Frank  Hmmm   interesting   Well I'm now craving sauerkraut at 3 am   Not sure how I can fix this as I'm mid bender   Trying to figure out how to sneak out of bed and get me a sandwich or something while I wait for the Xanax to kick in  I'm sorry if you feel I was preaching  I really didn't mean to come across that way  I love you too   I have no clue who you are  but you sound like a good person in need of a second chance   Everyone deserves a second chance  heck even a 3rd   4th    as long as there is the drive to want better   Wish you the best  and an awesome 2017   Thank you Lee   I realised yesterday why the year is an important milestone  It now means when I get asked 'How long ' I can reply with 'over a year' which I think signifies being in it for the long haul  Only time will tell if this is true     but just for today I will not drink with you  Well the 12 steps were apparently inspired by Bill Wilson's Ouija board sessions with a dead 15th century monk so it's subjective whether they are the be all and end all of recovery principles  I hear ya     my brain has been screwing with me this morning during my daily coffee ritual  Had someone sitting at the next table who was smoking    and the smell was intoxicating   I will be tagging you and following you  Thanks man  I think it's growing more and more clear that I need to go to rehab  I plan to next week  Detox at least  It would be nice to know what kind of wds I can expect but I guess the facility can answer that question  Try tapering with vodka   Always exciting and guaranteed to fail  Hi there  this is a good place to be for those who are dealing with recovery or addiction  I lurked for many moons before I made the decision to get serious about it  Good luck with your struggles  I agree   I have been screened and they didn't find anything    You are right  need to quit now   Good job and thank u for sharing  I'm new here and your post rly motivates me     Go to a meeting and find a sponsor there  Either died  sobered up or just too drunk to post   I took a break from here for 3 months and I was a combination of the last two   In no condition to post shit   or shitpost  I wish you the best life   You will have a beautiful life  because it's the only one you've got and you're doing really well for yourself     I'd feel like this would only tease me and possibly trigger a craving or something   I never tried Kratom  But if what you're telling me is true that it makes you feel that good  im Probably ok without it   Been free of drugs since April   No reason to fuck around  Congrats it seems like you made a lot of progress in the last year   Would you mind explaining your thoughts and feelings at 90 days and the urges you still felt  Please take care  Pancreatitis is no joke  It is one of the worst pain that one can feel   I think you know this by now    Stay sober and maintain your diet  You'll be good  thank you  Not the OP but I'm in a similar place so I'll answer   I go to just about any meeting I can  big book study included  Do I agree with everything the big book says  Of course not   But  like the guy you're responding too  it's powerful to be with a group of people who understand our mutual struggle    What I do not like and appreciate is the blame we sometimes take from religious zealots if we don't necessary assimilate whatever they say   Could you elaborate on this   I'm not sure what it means with respect to this conversation  signe me up plz Yep  sign me up    Starting out with no League and selling my gaming PC so I cannot go back   I will aim for 90 days and review from there  gotta get through January first     I am making the change as from the age of 19 23 while I have made some progress in other areas of my life it is not as much as I would like  It's time to focus on these areas  sign me plz I'm pretty sure I remember falling into a cactus last night   Might of been on the glass table that I also vaguely remember falling on and breaking   Now if I could just remember the sex that I'm positive I had   Fuck it   Chairs fuckers  Plants   We like them   Also forklifts I think that there are many paths to this place  I can relate to what you wrote  I often drank out of boredom  while watching movies or playing games  I just got tired of everything  the hangovers  not being able to perform at satisfactory levels  the monotony  at the end drinking just wasn't fun any more  And if I'm being honest to myself  it hadn't been for years  Huge accomplishment  Congrats on over 2 years   I coped by just realizing I cant control others  I realized pretty much all of my anger in life is caused by trying to control things that I have no control over   it's frustrating  I could explain this and that over and over to someone  but I am not inside someone's head  I realized it's better to not cling onto problems so hard  I let them go  and just was myself amid whatever was going on    As I'm sure you know  quitting is hard  You need to keep busy with other things that excite you and engage you  If you don't find a hobby or activity that keeps you sane  you'll go back  Also  it sounds like you may be dealing with some depression  I emplore you to talk to a doctor about it   You're already making the first step to recovery by making this post  There is no shame in reaching out for additional help  Don't white knuckle this  talk to a doctor about your lack of motivation  lack of energy  decrease pleasure in life   Good luck  Stay focused  stay strong Welcome   January 2nd is a great day to stop     "I hit rock bottom when I stopped digging "  I love this quote  Though my drinking could have gotten much worse  I put down the shovel and took the ladder that was offered to me   I will not drink today with you all   How do I actually remember what that's referring to  Nothing like crashing a forklift during your job interview   One beer  And you didn't have another  That my friend is success  I would of ended up having ten if I let myself have one   and sunny Manchester England  is colder than rainy so cal  I went to la jolla a few years back it's really nice Guess what   I will not drink today   D I'm not drinking with you fine folks today    I will not drink today  I will not drink today  For the next couple of weeks   r cripplingalcoholism is participating in our yearly population survey   Please take a few

without it is a victory  savour that and don't get too overwhelmed with the lifestyle change  best of luck   Respectfully  I would suggest that being overly cynical of every avenue that offers help  regardless of whether or not one thinks it works for them personally based on a limited trial  can be unhelpful in making progress  By not being honest with ourselves about our responsibility for our problems  and not being honest with ourselves about whether we're ready to change  we're shooting ourselves in the foot when it comes to fixing said problems   I can certainly understand your attitude about counseling  bc I had that same attitude when I first tried it  But my way of dealing with my problems  scorning others' suggestions of help  insisting that I had to have everything on my own terms with immediate results  and continuing to make excuses for why I drank  kept me in my same shitty situation  My situation didn't change  bc I didn't change my situation   It wasn't until I accepted that I was the only one responsible for my drinking  who could choose to stop drinking  and who could make sure I actually followed through  that I decided to try counseling again with an open mind  Open  that is  to criticism about my attitude and way of thinking about things  Open to suggestions  Open to trying something different than I had before  And this experience was also much better  bc I felt the counselor and I "clicked" better  communication wise  She was able to be objective  not bc I paid her  but bc she didn't come into the session with preconceived notions about me  and she really listened  If that was lacking in your first 3 counseling experiences  then no wonder you sound cynical   Lastly  if you feel that AA is too "preachy" for you  and criticize the program and those who find that it helps them  then out of curiosity  why are you insisting on going the AA route  There are other programs to try that are for agnostics or even atheists    Whatever route you choose  I hope you'll find the tools you're looking for to help you move forward  Ah  memories   It's too bad reality never lives up to those rose colored glasses   Instead it's an all too short almost bliss followed by shame  by feeling dirty  the high is never quite as good as I remembered   Or I go for broke and either wake up in my own puke  if I'm lucky  or in the back of an ambulance  or not at all   Maybe then I realize the futility and get to go through the same old bullshit over again  withdrawals  new sobriety date  PAWS   Or I don't and the path just keeps getting darker  the spiral steeper  suddenly I remember all the reasons I quit in the first place   The personal hell that is using  the way no one can trust me  the way I burn through family and friends  lighting up bridges all along the way   Spending my life waiting for a call  waiting in a parking lot  waiting to scrounge up some money some shameful way   Chasing a high  then chasing normal  then chasing to just not want to die   Waking up in the morning wishing it had been the last time I went to sleep   Sometimes I can almost convince myself there was contentment back then   almost   I'm not saying that was or would be your experience  I just know what mine was and what it would be if I forgot what my life was really like back when I was using   In my dreams it was all fuzzy warm happiness  but in reality it was hell  Sometimes I forget what hell felt like  writing it out helps me remember   Stay sober  keep that clean time   There is no such thing as just once   You can do this   Good luck  Not drinking with you today pintaschild  Welcome  I stopped on 2nd January last year by initially committing to a Dry January   I saw enough improvement to keep on the wagon  I take things one day at a time   I will not drink with you today  I'm not drinking today  Instead I shall be getting myself prepared for my first day at my new job tomorrow  Nervous   I'm in  not drinking with you today SD Messed up dreams are really common when you come off the green  and I don't know how common the dream within a dream stuff is but I've experienced that too  Best advice I can give is to not dwell on them  that stuff didn't happen  think of it as a good thing   it shows your brain is rewiring back to sobreity  And as your memory improves actual life events will take up the space instead of these fictions    I know the dwelling thing is easier said than done  but just think of this community and know we're all going through something similar and here to talk at anytime   Best of luck and happy new year   In my experience it can go either way   When I quit  my two best friends were both heavy drinkers   I no longer talk to one of them very often   she can NOT wrap her head around being sober  To her  alcohol is "fun" and anyone who isn't drinking can't be "fun"   My other friend  We meet up all the time for sober coffee and sober dinners  She still gets wasted on the weekends but she has definitely reduced her drinking and our friendship has grown much  much stronger       Plus there are all the other friends I've made through the hobbies I now have the time and energy to persue   Bonus   I don't get wasted and ruin those friendships  So sober me is coming out way ahead  I will not drink today  I will not drink today  I will not drink today  Good for you  There's no better day than today to quit gaming  You've got this  Thanks for the message of support   It will be an interesting journey     I will NOT drink today   Thank you  Keep focussing on one day at a time  You'll get here too  Sounds good mate  I never went to AA but I always keep it in mind that I could go there if I need to  This Christmas was my 3rd sober  but I had a little fuckup in 2015  The best advice I ever got was "dry people  dry places"  as in  stay out of the bars and stay away from boozy people until you feel unthreatened by the temptation to drink  I never enter a situation in which I am not 100  cast iron certain I won't drink  I prioritise sobriety above virtually everything  I also try to "play the tape forward"  meaning I am honest with myself about what happens when I drink and don't pretend that I have magically become able to handle it now I've had a few months off  One other thing is remembering "HALTT"  hungry angry lonely thirsty tired  and addressing these issues states of mind before thinking a beer is what I need  These things  and working on the core reasons why I drank in the first place  boredom  fear and frustration mostly  and changing things in my life to replace the sauce means I don't really fancy the idea of drinking now  Getting into exercise is good  as it really highlights the difference in energy levels that sobriety brings  and the free endorphins feel great  And of course hanging out on here every now and again for some support  Good to have you here mate  Like any addiction  gaming addiction holds you back in life  The only solution is quitting  You can do it  Thank you Red  I'm looking forward to you joining me in the not too distant future    Good for her  Hey man  I'm a fellow New Year's N00b  and today I'm not drinking with you    You should really think about seeing a counselor   therapist to discuss and resolve your intense feelings  if you mean "January challenge" then the answer is no  You need to check in there too  goodluck  You can't avoid them 100  but you CAN stay the hell away from 95  of them by avoiding gaming websites  forums  videos  and streams  Massive congratulations   I have 364 days to go    Holy       congratulations  calling someone a bloody idiot and my keyboard is broken so i missed a t and train of thought    1 day out of 365 was successfully completed and i am very happy and proud about it   I do not need porn and i can surely live without it    goodluck all and have a nice day      It's on brother  Today I'm going to begin service to my local AA group and start chairing a meeting   I'm then going to meet my sponsor for breakfast and work on my 6th Step   I'm doing a lot of work to keep me from a drink  so I will not drink today  Thanks for the suggestion   actually signed up for a badge a few minutes ago   I intend to stay strong and stay sober   Beautiful day here in the UK and time to walk the dogs  You've got this   What a great way to start the year  Me  too   I won't drink with you guys today     I will not drink today  I will not drink today  Yup   You're not wrong   It sure does suck   Nice thing is  though  that you never have to feel this way again   Just keep on keeping on  This   I learned that I can go a whole calendar year without alcohol   Birthdays  weddings  including my own   4th July  Thanksgiving  Christmas   I don't need to drink for any of those   So that was pretty sweet  Now I want to feast on hotdogs  Quality sausage  smart bun  little mustard and sauerkraut     No knife   no  Maybe it works for you but masturbation makes me feel weak and demotivated so I just decided to do away with it  Sign me up please  Sorry about the late sign up  Thank you  It's so freeing to be sober  A great 17 to you as well   I think what is dangerous for young people is the boys watch lorn which just uses women as objects and just for their bodies  Girls watch music videos in which the singers are highly sexualized i e  They are popular because they are sexy  put these two together you have the start of many unhealthy relationships  Boys believe women are there as sex object and girls are taught you are only important if you are desired sexually  And so to 'keep up' they do what the boys want which is porn like acts  2017 will include more playing the tape forward for me  It always ends the same  in so many ways  Doesn't it    Great job on 427  Thank you  Have a great 17 as week  Definitely  I am getting close to beating my longest streak which I set in 2014  Taking it one day at a time  has been really helpful  Congrats on your success  but don't let your guard down  Let's make this a year we will never forget  Thank you  I'm excited but nervous  New start   Happy New Year   Great job   Give both a rest for a while  think about and do other activities "That I would wake up from a blackout with consequences I could never fix"  Those words resonate so clearly with me and I am determined not to let it happen   You have clearly succeeded and I wish you and your family continued health and happiness   I will not drink with you today   Amazing  Well done  Definitely  I am stressing a theme saying which is day by day  Worry about making it through today  That is all  There is less pressure on me with this simple goal  Let's make this a great year  I'm so sorry for your losses and glad you are taking care of yourself now  That IS sweet  Great job making it through all of those days  Awesome  Checking in  First day back to work  Looking forward to the structure of  If Nothing else  Stay strong everyone   Id say your training wheels will get you there eventually if you want  CA's will reach for a drink first thing just to get out of bed  chances are youll vomit  but youll force yourself to drink more because youll feel worse if you dont  We will have to equip ouselves with enough to make it through the day  We wont drink a 1 3 or a 1 2 of anything  because if there is a bottle it is to be finished    Heaven forbid you run out the shakes will be so bad you cant drink or feed yourself  there will be vomiting  lots of it  hallucinations  seizures  you will have alcoholic polyneuropathy in your hands and feet all the time drinking or not  this is numbness pain which will gradually progress centrally toward the body from nerve damage from too much drinking  this also impairs motor function so simple tasks are hard  You also feel like you have been kicked in the kidneys liver most of the time  At least thats what its like for me   Noone here talks about shit because its a given that you are pissing out your ass most of the time  So yeah training wheels buddy  Consider it a good thing   edit for spellz It sounds like you are in a good space  I wish you continued success on your reset as 2017 gets under way  Very true  something that I'd be pushing down the line otherwise    Thanks for the support   it's truly needed   I meditate  I consider it practicing being detatched  When I actually need to use it when I am angry or on some negative runaway emotion  I try to go back to where I was in meditation  It is hard though  It is so easy to forget when negative emotions are trying to take you away from yourself  Sometimes I'll just be in some negative rut of just grinding over some issue   and it takes me hours before I remember to actually come back to reality  I am doing better  but it is no short journey  I'm not drinking today  You must take this addiction seriously  If your gf is supportive you should try calling her when you feel the urge or somebody you can trust  I find that riding out the urge helps a lot  Understand that the urge will eventually leave no matter how strong the temptation is  I actually had to ride out a strong urge this morning to watch a porn star I have watched for years  it sucked  but I made it through unscathed    Also another thing that is helping me  is to focus on making it through today  I am not worried about tomorrow  hitting a big streak  etc  I just need to survive today   That's an interesting point  and I have never really thought about it that way  I suppose alcoholism is alcoholism and you're right  this can only last so long  Can you let me know what you meant by 'I juggled a lot of things    until one day it was all too much '  When did you know you'd had enough    The problem is I definitely know I can continue this life and excel for now and drink at the same time  I guess my fear is what you've mentioned  that something is going to go wrong further down the line  It's just so hard when there isn't really an incentive to do so  Nobody disappointed in me or my actions  I've not been arrested for being naked in public or anything which might  kick start  me   I guess I just feel a little blind as to the benefits   Thank you for getting back to me  I'm sorry that the evening didn't go as planned  I hope you and your husband are able to have an open conversation about alcohol    I will not drink with you today   There's an option called Refuge here in Canada and also available in the US Hey just checking in with you to see how you are travelling   We are ihere to support and motivate ourselves and you to get sober   There is lots of good advice based on personal experience and lots of people showing   love  support  friendship  kindness to Internet strangers because we have all been there done that in the process of trying to get sober and then stay sober   You can do this  you are not alone  nor are you so unique and different from us that you won't be able to get sober  My advice read this sub daily and often during he day  the lessons  support  ideas  experiences are pure gold for a drinker  Please stay in touch  keep us up to date with your journey    You sound Aussie to me am I right   day 1 2 and 3 are hard  but it does get easier  just push through  don't give up  if you can help it  Getting sober is the best thing I ever did for me  I hope you can do it too        Good job man  Keep growing and developing yourself  Maybe you could provide some details about your experience  Riding out the urge is tough  but we must remember the urge doesn't last for long  A lot of us are good at procrastination  so we can use that skill for good by delaying ourselves from watching  which leads to the urge leaving  I will not drink today  The month of January is going to be one of change for us at work but we don't know how  what or who will be affected  I will not let fear of the unknown take over   Yeah  I don't know why people get so defensive about this and start downvoting and talking shit  It just sucks falling for a whore  no false moralism  It sucks when the woman you like start sleeping around  People don't get that  It does    But it will eventually get better    we've got this    I swear I don't want to do this again  repeat day 1   I won't drink with u Dude you just saved me from playing  Thanks a ton and let's beat this together   That's unbelievably helpful  You have no idea  really   I think it's a spot on representation of how I've been feeling the past 8 years or so  I started drinking heavily when my first relationship ended  After that I got over it  but I never felt the same again  I put it down to having depression and depression only  which was something I knew I had control of but there was always a part of that had control over me   I've been steadily less and less happy over the time since  and now I'm at the point where everything is just a milestone to pass in order to get to the next part where I might feel  not so depressed   For example  Christmas is over and I'm now just counting the days until I go to Thailand in February  There's no inherent excitement I used to feel in actually going  just wanting to get there so I can actually feel something   Do you think alcohol could be the reason for this numbed sense of life I'm feeling now   Really  thank you for your comment  Everyone in here is being so kind and it's helping greatly  Thank you for sharing your story  I can only relate to how you feel  not your circumstances  I  26F  have been smoking for the past 4 years and I'm only just realising what it's doing to me   my college work is falling behind and I lack the motivation to even get up in the morning  I plan to quit  today  Telling my parents about this is not even an option I'm going to consider  so I will do it alone  Please stay strong because there are people here who genuinely want you to get better  even though we don't know you  we just know how it feels  Good luck  my friend  Boy do I know what you mean  spoke to a dear friend last night on the phone  I could understand maybe 70  of what she said  It was late afternoon early evening  boy did that bring back memories  Don't miss those experiences    Victory   I like to think that a life full of small and pleasant things   dewy skin  a warm hug  comfy shoes   adds up to a long   lived  life no matter the number of calendar days    Gratitude is my new attitude for 2017  Congrats on 35 days  I will not drink with you today   I'm a self employed designer  The increase in productivity is a very great perk  Good work  Congrats  that is quite the accomplishment  Aww you look so nice  You definitely have a pleasant face  Made me smile right back at you  When I was drinking I would always wake up at 3am  Always  I would stagger to the bathroom  chug some water then stumble back to bed  I sleep like a rock now  Love it  I didn't have heartburn but my stomach was upset or bloated every day  It's gone now  Imagine that   Congrats on a year    Thank you for sharing that with me  I really appreciate it  I feel like I'm think I'm you around where your fourth sentence ended  Reading these comments is making me realise that I might not be the special  superherohighfunctioning  alcoholic I thought I was  It's all going to go tits up if I don't do anything about this soon   Quick question  do you still hang around with people who drink  I live in a big house of 7 people you see  Everyone is quite big drinkers in the house  They're so wonderful and the last thing I want to do is move out  but do you have any advice for managing that  I think keeping a journal is a great idea  Fuck you alcohol I'm saying NO WAY and going to AA today   Thank you  I'm definitely going to give it a read  There's been so much support  Thank you  I am one day behind you   Stay strong  Today is my first day too   And I have just started practicing ukulele  I will not drink today   Thanks SD  You have inspired me to write my relapse story  Ten days after you were admitted to the hospital  I hit a very low rock bottom  It went real bad for me  I have 100 days today and I am also just happy to BE  Good job on one year  I love seeing all of the changes you experienced in one year  All by choosing to not drink  Yes  Thank you for sharing  All my friends that have given up on that shit are super better now  Many had entirely new lives in about two years  It's pretty amazing  but the process sucks and withdrawals are hard and really really suck   After you're not sick than you feel like a new person  Staying stopped takes work  but its growth like anything else   I'd say go back to  r stopdrinking  lurk  hangout  comment  etc  it's a positive place which is needed early on   Don't be discouraged by the mods  Ever since that stupid news article and the inflation of the subs membership  as well as the egos of a few mods  it's been a little weird  but it's still a really good place  Use it to meet sober people  which is what it's for   Good luck  work your program  check your pride  and be a better person for you  and no one else    Not drinking with you all today    You didn't know it  but I didn't drink with you last night  I'm not drinking tonight with you either  Have a great day  Thanks for your post  I can definitely feel one 'yet' coming along with my work  As I mentioned  we can work anywhere we want  At the moment my working hours are Mon Thu 9am 6pm and Fri 9am 12pm  I find myself working from home at every opportunity because I am often too tired to get out of bed  Fridays I often log in when I wake up and then go back to sleep  Luckily at the moment I have control over my workload so it's not too much of a big deal  and my KPI's are always spot on  but it does feel strikingly like what you've said  How long until my performance drops  you know   Thanks again for your comment  really appreciate it and I hope all goes well with you  Personally right now I allow myself to fap when the urge arises  Which is not as much as I thought it would be  I am more focused on quitting porn than not fapping right now  I want to focus my willpower on this for now so as I strengthen it without porn  I can eventually have more willpower to use it on abstaining from fapping  The changes to your appearance will only improve  skin tone  collagen rebuilding  firmness   hydration  less puffy face and eyes  etc  Over time I also noticed improvements to my hair  Initially I stopped drinking due to vanity  I was sick of waking up and being horrified when I saw the hungover troll peering back at me through the mirror  I thought I was just aging poorly but after 1 month sober I realized it was all the booze draining my beauty    Congrats on stopping and expect to hear more compliments    I don't think I'll ever get over the feeling of caring about someone so much and wanting something so badly for them  knowing they don't care about them self or want it for them self  And I don't think there will ever come a time that I don't have some level of optimism  This is exactly how I feel about my father drinking  I used to think I hate him since I was a kid but after reading this  I think I hate his drinking more  I hope you find you some relief and thanks for posting   I'm not drinking today  Yesterday I thought to myself "2017 will be my first sober year " That might be so  but I don't want to forget that we are all working on staying sober TODAY   I will not drink today  I refuse to be complacent  Strength in numbers   Great job on one year    Don't hate it  see it for what it is as a path to better yourself  What is more appealing  the uninformed person who watches porn occasionally while living a mediocre life not fully knowing how it limits them  Or the knowlegable person who quits altogether and becomes the best version of himself  If you didn't fully know how porn affects you in a negative way then you could never fully know what you would become without it  Make sense  I am guessing this is the kind of stuff that they teach in alchemy    Life is duller but you don't have the lows  I think I needed to hear someone say this  I think generally accepting that things are going to change is a big personal thing for me  It's nice to hear for the first time that people are actually enjoying life despite the fact that things are a bit greyer  edit  maybe the colour and happiness I feel from alcohol is only fake happiness  god I don't know  this is all so confusing    Hopefully if I give up  the colour is going to come from elsewhere    Thanks a million  Thank you for sharing your story  I hope you get better  Xxx Quit before it gets worse  The amount of dopamine we get from porn can be just as harmful to our brains as drugs  It may seem harmless now  but overtime it will get worse and be even harder to quit  I am 22 now and have been trying to quit for the last 3 years  it's not easy  You should be happy you found this community at such a young age  Will not drink today   Have the week off and going to get into a good groove with exercise and meal prep    Good luck I see great things for you this year   On this train with you today   We got this   What a triumph  Thank you for writing this up   this day you've helped and inspired more people than you'll ever know  I won't drink with you today  That's exactly how I felt this Christmas  I always felt like I was about 1cm out of the room  I was there  answering questions  making up funny quizzes and telling jokes  but I wasn't quite with it   I just want the best for myself and my family  I don't think I'm the best I can be right now   Thanks for your comment  Really appreciate it like I do all of your comments  You're taking the time pro bono to help me and that's something I haven't had in such abundance before  I'm 5 days smoke free and feeling really proud  doesn't sound much but to me it's amazing   I wanted to stop for a while and said I would in the new year however I got flu and bad chest infection so gave me the incentive to stop sooner  Good luck on your smoke free journey      Hey I'm checking in to every check in I see  I'm on board   Welcome  As university teacher  I can honestly say that not drinking makes my job much easier and  not so coincidentally  the students much more enjoyable to spend time with    For me  the first three days were miserable and I spent most of that time flitting from one distraction to another just to make it sober to day four  After that  I gave myself permission to just work on creating new  sober  routines for the first month  which also meant eating entirely too much sugar  ice cream and jellybeans   By the end of 30 days  my alcohol cravings were a dull  infrequent roar and so were my sugar cravings  Not being too hard on myself for poor food choices and reading hear daily were the main things that got me through the early days    Oh  Sleep   my favorite gift of sobriety   was actually restful after the first week  That  in and of itself  was awesome    I will not drink with you today   I'm wondering    If you can stay sober for six months without AA  why do you think you need it now  I'm so proud of you for one year plus    GREAT job   Last year I felt like I wouldn't message u ninjilla for a one year coin  This year  if I hit that mark  I will   What an amazing act of recognition  All through the internet  This place amazes me day in and day out in such a positive way     I am going to work and not drinking with you today   Day 7   Congrats  I can certainly relate to your description of the dawning knowledge that moderation is a no go  Glad you're here  and I won't drink with you today  Thank you  You know something  Me too    For you too   Welcome and best wishes  So proud of you   What an awesome  healthy accomplishment  Thank you for this post  and a special thanks to all that the mods do on here to keep this sub going     Hi bobaduk   We are sharing some pretty common ground    I only drink in the evenings but it is never "just the one drink"   I have looked in the mirror  don't like what I see and am being honest with myself for the first time in years   I also want to make 31 12 17 a sober NYE   I wish you success and am happy to share the journey with you  That's great     I had a simikar thing the other day where i opened the camera on my phone and it was on selfie mode so my face was right there in the screen  Normally i have a mad panic trying to switch the mode back as quick as i can so as not to look at my face  But this time i actually thought wow i look pretty good and healthy   Which is a big change     Trusting myself to do what I committed to  and actually delivering on that promise was hugely significant  more than anyone else might realise   If I can't trust me  who can I trust  Rely on  Lean on    I needed to be able to be the person I could count on and every time I was not  a little bit of life and light faded   I was sooo glad when I stated to deliver on my promises to myself  and it still is a great source of contentment for me  Thanks scrawn11  Reading it today  The few days after the drunken event  I always have this huge motivation to stay sober  The Q is    Any advice on maintaining this motivation  Great motivation in this forum of course and maybe staying in touch here could help  Special drink coins  for sure  You earned those special coins  Great job  The "superpower" thing is basically our brains coming back down to normal levels of dopamine  that we can get a high from regular things  We are so numb that basic human traits seem like superpowers because we haven't really felt them before   I read everything and it was very insightful  But I can't lie the keyboard thing caught my attention because I am a mechanical keyboard nerd  Love me some Cherry MX Blues   I got the pleasure of being the DD for my boyfriend and a dear mutual friend on NYE  It was such a privilege  They're not heavy drinkers but they had a few and I sipped free ginger ale all night and danced my tuckus off  It was awesome and fun and I remember all of it     I hope my nieces and nephews call me for a ride if they need it no matter what too  way to go being an exceptional Aunt   Not drinking today   Holidays have gotten a bit too long for my young kids   they are climbing the walls and stuff and that has always been one of my main excuses to pour a stiff bourbon   Last night was pretty bad   I was exhausted and kids were too   and fighting since that's what tired kids do   I did NOT pour a stiff drink or any other kind of booze   I did end up making yet another green tea at 10PM   So   here I am   day 70 and still going   I will not drink today  SD   I'm in   Congrats   And wishing you the same  Take everything one day at a time  Live in the moment  Let's all make it to the end this year  I think this is the thing I shouldn't say  but I feel alcohol did enhance my life for a long time  As I said I live in London  and I got caught up on this absolutely magical  magnificent  hedonistic scene of people  Take a look at  these images  https   www google co uk search q sink the pink london safe off espv 2 biw 1312 bih 744 source lnms tbm isch sa X ved 0ahUKEwjMgOvzs6PRAhXjBcAKHYOKCbQQ AUIBigB   It's this insane  colourful world where alcohol and drugs are taken and in honesty  it did enhance the experience  It made me feel alive  Now that scene is kind of gone  I've grown out of it and am more in favour of dinner parties and hanging with friends  so alcohol doesn't serve the purpose of fun filled frivolity it did anymore   I think I'm hanging onto my younger days when booze was this amazing thing that made you feel confident and cool  and now it's just something I'm using to get through a night out   Can you let me know how it felt when you describe 'true enjoyment  peace  rest and meaningful interactions'  That's probably not the easiest feat  but I genuinely am struggling to see how I will ever be able to experience them  How long did it take you off the drink to start having these  Was there a period between giving up and starting to experience these things   I haven't heard of 30 60 90 days without alcohol  But that sounds like a great idea  I'm going to try my first 30 days without booze this January  So far I've not had anything and I feel quite committed to it    Thanks so much for your advice    Way to go   Five months is an eternity  I am so happy for you  72h is the peak of cravings  Hang on  on day at a time  Also check whyquit com or Joel Spitzer on YouTube for a lot of information on what happens during the quit  daily videos   Oh my  yes  The voice saying  "Well  there you go again having another drink   " laughed at me daily  I am beginning 2017 so much happier with me   Now if I were you I would make a bullet list of all the things you can look forward to once you are free from the clutches of alcohol  I have my list of things I am starting to realize are possible   I am glad to be here with all of you today  because all of us are on day 1 together   I will not drink today  I got sober at 39 also  It gave me a new life too I will not drink today   Ahh  the peak  That makes a lot of sense  I'll check the videos out  thanks  Not drinking today  NYE "a sip of champagne at midnight won't hurt" was the hard part  Today   easy peasy  Good luck  I am quitting cigarettes  PMO and weed so i kinda know what you're going through  Good luck  We got this  I wasn't confident when I started either  but what made it a bit easier was realizing all I had to do was make it through today sober   Rinse  repeat  and 365 one day stints later we will have a year   You can do this   I will not drink with you today   I relate well to your post  I'm almost 6 months along and I still reflect on my past drinking  It feels really good to write it out though doesn't it  For me  when I write out my feelings  it makes it more real and makes me deal and confront those feelings  I will say for me  not drinking has absolutely changed my life 1000  for the better  Keep it up  I will stay sober with you today   i honestly cant recommend it  most of the "benefits" of nofap pfree were thought up by people who are porn addicts  or at least had a nasty habit with the stuff  from what you posted  i would not say you belong in either of those groups  as for falling asleep  nofap will actually hurt you with that    also  dont take the advice of this community too seriously  what youre doing is equivalent to crashing an AA meeting and asking if it would be a "good idea" for you to quit booze  of course you will get a bunch of lectures about the dangers of alcoholism  how everyone wishes they had never touched that first drink etc  no honorable mention of all those folks who drink occasionally and have a great time doing it    now  im not saying its NOT a good idea for you to quit porn  just that the reasons in your post do feel like its necessary   I think it's the health reasons mainly  Sometimes I get this weird feeling near my liver  It's not pain but it's just an uncomfortable feeling especially when lying down  I think this is almost certainly something to do with alcohol  Doc said not to worry about it but I have a sneaky feeling that's what it is   Aside from that  it's the absolute knowledge that I am the person in my life that drinks more than anyone else  I know it  I have another friend who has alcoholism but I know she drinks less than me  I suppose it's the shame of that knowledge that I'm  the worst  that is making me want to quit     Honest question  Was drinking one of the ways you managed that   Absolutely  for a time  Booze numbed my depression and stopped me from thinking about it  Then I discovered CBT and managing my thoughts effectively  and I gained some control over it  but now you mention it  I think when I'm most depressed is when I drink the most  so I'm almost certainly using it as a coping mechanism in some senses still   Thanks for sharing your comments about your own personal journey  Lots of people have mentioned losing a part of yourself  the part that alcohol gives you   however you and others also mentioned that new and other exciting things come about which you like more in your life  I don't think I ever got as far as thinking of the good things that would come along  and instead only thought about removing the bad things and coming back onto a neutral level  This gives me hope   Thank you very much   I'm all in  I feel inspired today  i won't drink today  It will be hard  Sometimes it might even seem impossible  But your life will improve beyond your wildest dreams  I promise you    Way to go reaching out for help  That's one of the hardest things any of us do  Somewhere along the way  we learn to keep doing it and  sooner than we think  we're the ones reaching out to help the next miserable alcoholic  I was one  I drank a gallon of whisky a day  every day  for two years  after spending the 10 years prior to that ratcheting up to that point  I was dying and I walked into AA  I found this sub when I started reading Reddit  I'm really grateful for SD as well as my twelve step community    We love you  We're here for you  You are never alone in this  Osprey   404  GREAT job and good to see you  I hope you had a great holiday with your family  I will not drink today     http   sd bot nu badgedate  For me personally  the first few weeks are relatively "easy"  I don't get physical withdrawals and the hangovers are fresh in my mind    As time goes on  for me  it's the one month mark  my addicted brain kicks in    "Come on girl  you've done a month  A TRUE alcoholic is pouring vodka on their cornflakes   Just have a couple  On a weekend  Like a normal person  You're all good now "  Then I'm back onto my daily drinking routine faster than you can pop a cork    It's kind of like when you see all the gyms full in January  dead in February  Everyone starts with good intentions  to keep going takes dedication  One day at a time    This time I recognise this is where I need to do the hardest work    I've started a blog to keep myself accountable  and also to become ridiculously famous and make millions haha   I've looked into online courses that will help me in my career so that when I get home from work I'll have something constructive to do rather than just sit  slowly drinking myself to bad health and unhappiness  I'm reading so many books  I'm chatting here with like minded people  I'm going to AA     I saw a quote recently that said "falling down is an accident  staying down is a choice"  I'm choosing to NOT stay down    Good luck to you  we've got your back    I will not drink with you today   Great to read such a story  That's what life is about   Great to read such a story  That's what life is about   Okay so far  Woot  Congrats on getting the first two weeks under your belt  those are doozies   I will not drink with you today  I could be looking into a mirror to my future with you  I think it's about time I did something about this  Just started crying  God I didn't realise when I posted this that I'd actually begin to realise what I'm doing to myself   Thank you  really  It's my pleasure   keep us posted  What wonderful progress over the past year   Great job  I'm excited to see what other small changes you add in 2017  Your slow n steady wins the race approach is working  That's great     Quitting before desparation is quite extraordinary   This hit me hard  Thank you  For me  it was such a strange feeling combining hurting for her and celebrating for myself  Was it similar for you   I definitely do feel lucky to have realised this  I hope I can get there before it gets worse  Thank you  Happy to not drink today  Coming up 100 days soon    not drinking mannnnngggg I am totally with you  So sick of this    I'm in things i can't do    drink  list of things i could do    everything        i don't know what i enjoy most going to bed sober  waking up sober  or being clear headed throughout the day so i can actually be productive    Why not all three    It's a sales site  So because he had a really good experience with Kratom and is recommending a reputable source for a legal substance  this is spam   What if I post a link to my favorite brand of immodium lope   Kratom has done great things for me as well  Any substance that taps your opiod receptors is a slippery slope  of course   But to tell you the truth  I've never really gotten high off kratom  It covered about 50  of my WDs from Subs and gave me room to get out of that posionous drug  But not once did I really 'enjoy' taking it  It helped me sleep and helped me function at work and most importantly  helped me get my mind right    You can't expect a sick mind to make right recovery decisions  That is the beauty of having a bridge like kratom or even subs  Just my opinion  My family is on holidays and I will not drink today  Take care  Your post has been automatically removed because you used a keyword which is reserved for the

questions or concerns   Checking in with an inquisitive eye toward the future     Alcoholism for me was a disease of selfishness   This is absolutely right  Although I don't hurt anyone at the moment  it's definitely something that I do with an entire disregard for the possibility of hurting someone else or myself  I'm just lucky I haven't  edit  yet   I think my biggest reasons to quit are my health  but also I would like to do it for the financial side of my life  I know alcohol slowly munches away at my salary every month  and I feel so ashamed that it does    I have about 1400 a month after everything goes out for myself  and yet at the end of every month I end up with 2 50 left  my credit card maxed out and I'm literally hitting F5 on my internet banking screen at 11 59pm before payday so I can pay everything off and get back into the black  I then find myself in the position where my wage has just paid off my debts  so I turn to drink because I get so down about never being able to save  I can definitely pocket 500  a month if I gave up alcohol  Maybe this can be my incentive   Thank you for your comment  you've all been so helpful  What a brilliant community  Where is the Kratom from  If it's from a reputable website  start with 3 4g  If it's from a headshop  you may need 5 8g    For me  less was more  I stabilized on 2 5g 3x a day before tapering off Kratom   The key here is not to try to get 'high' off of the kratom  but to feel normal or almost normal   Pm me for good sources online  Some even do same day or 1 day shipping  at a price    It is MUCH better than going back to pills  Especially with all those death pills going around  I think thats totally true  I'm very lucky in that most  if not all of my friends would still hang out with me if I chose a non drinking path  My mum also has an alcohol issue  and I think it would benefit her too if I didn't drink in her presence  I will not drink with all of you today SD  x I'm so happy for you  Congrats on one year  I'm sitting here thinking about what January 1 has brought  There are so many of you who sometime around the new year decided it was time to make some changes  To have been here witnessing most of that journey with you is heartwarming  Then  there are so many Day 1's  Wow  I'm overjoyed to see that many people ready to make a change   My goal for 2017 is to embrace being sober with the same idea as you have  One day at a time  Don't get too far ahead of myself  It can be done but patience and diligence is needed  So  here goes  I will not drink today with you    Have a great day  I will not drink today  I really love this  Let's use our joy in our newfound sobriety to help others in whatever ways we can   This entire post has been brigaded heavily by r kratom  As each day goes by  you are one step closer to removing one of those things on your list  Your anxiety will lessen  puffiness will go away   and so on  You're here  and that's what's important  I will not drink with you today  It's best to let these things pass without thinking of them  Treat them as what they are   a joke  It would be a joke to go back after fighting for 3 months   Meditation helps a lot 1 2   three four  I ain't going to drink no more   Still not drink daily with you folks  Enjoying the new year   sober   For the next couple of weeks   r cripplingalcoholism is

ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles PMC4369544     Just the abstract doesn't tell you much  you may want to read the whole article  After the 90 days I was very keen on attempting to moderate it  actually I was too keen on it  I just felt that I am not even remotely over it   I had the strongest urges at around 150 days actually  80  of the time I was thinking about gaming  but that went away after one week and since then the urge is completely gone  Like death struggle  Oh nooos  look guys   it magically fucking dissolved  http   i imgur com YOEfGRT jpg     Apparently we don't have two fake fucks who are lying twats     My bad    Just kidding  I filled that with water     They're frauds  Woohoo  Great job   If you know it to be true  that is all that matters  Your Your beliefs and true self are shown in your actions and your loved ones will fall in line with your actions   The most you can do is to tell your GF  'LOOK  I am clean right now and damn proud  I am going to live my life clean  You can either believe me or not '  Don't stress too much  I will not drink today   Yes  The small wins are always the most meaningful for me  One of my favorites is that when I can't find the right word for a sentence I no longer panic and worry that it's because of alcohol delated damage  It's just simple stupidity   Who would have ever thought I would celebrate my intellectual weaknesses      I am not drinking today      I will not drink today  I kinda did the same thing but in a different way really  I simply just unfollowed anyone who posted triggering pictures to me on instagram  I follow lots of people on instagram who post nothing provocative at all and I really didn't wanna miss out on those so I unfollowed the dirty ones and feed is now as clean as it gets     The answer to that question is  you're not ready to quit  Maybe it was me that miss read your comment then  Gratz on your journey and great 2017  I find that often times the path of some resistance yields far better results than the path of least resistance  Giving in to drink is easy  Being a warrior and fighting the good fight has some resistance  but you come out on the other side a better person for it   just like you are making this post  Hell yeah  I will not drink today  I've been making it through visits that used to REALLY tempt me to drink   but this time was different  I don't miss drinking at all  I didn't think that was possible  Bring on 2017  Holy fuck you drink so much you must have space aids like this is FOR REAL SERIOUS CRIPPLING DRINKING how are you alive   DID YOU ACTUALLY SAY WE DONT TALK ABOUT POST DRINKING SHITS YOU FUCKING IDIOT   YOU ARE A POST DRINKING SHIT FUCK OFF It's such a huge thing and I have so many feeling and thoughts that it's difficult to streamline it into a text  at least for me  Just one thing  The by FAR most important change is my feeling towards time   When I was gaming I was constantly thinking about how little time I have left  everyday  and that everything I do  be it school or going out  takes even more from that precious time  And if you want to get better at a game you just can't have enough time  so that I really really wanted to earn money as a pro or streamer just so that I can play more   And this leads to very short sleep  I always felt that's a waste of time   avoiding of relaxation like chilling at the beach and it leads to unhappiness because you can't really solve that problem  So when you quit gaming you realize that you have a lot time  In the beginning you will be bored to death  But soon you will find things to do  you will probably find so many things that you have to decide which one you prefer  Now I can enjoy what I'm doing without thinking about getting back home to start Steam I will not drink today  I thought I had already singed up for this but lets go  Thank you     Hopefully home time in the next few days  Well said   captures my experience here  as well  Welcome  everyone  Good luck on your new job   I will not drink today Right there with you  I'm going for 30 days sober at the moment    after drinking essentially every single night for the passed 4 months  We can do it  I  like you  seek to deepen my humanity this year   More personal understanding  leading to more positive citizenship and stewardship  leading to more personal satisfaction  leading to more personal understanding  and so on   I also do not know what forms these changes may take  and I am fighting to be open to whatever my growth may bring   Today i will NOT DRINK to awareness and growth with you  In terms of quantity  I'll drink 2 bottles of shitty brandy during a day  Something like half a bottle during the day  one bottle and a half at night  i would tend to agree  this is a more healthy way of looking at progress  you can look at it like this  there are two main methods of dealing with addiction  of any kind   the abstinence model  and the recovery model  the focus on streaks of abstinence with no "relapses" is IMO an abstinence model   im not trying to say ones better than the other  and if going for a streak works for you  then it works for you  In my case  I often can go 2 weeks without porn  and end up relapsing  This has been going on for a while now  this is better than what it used to be  viewing porn daily or multiple times a week for almost 10 years   The recovery model is about slow change and long term goals   seeing improvement over time and not overly focusing on those times you messed up   Right now Im disappointed that I cant keep a longer streak than a couple weeks  why do I always have to go back  what needs is porn filling for me  how else can i meet those needs  and how can i plan preemptively to have a back up plan when my ego becomes nothing and I feel like looking at porn because my life feels like it doesnt matter  Will Remember September   I think I'll try running 4 to 5k about 4 times a week  I smoke a lot when I drink  and running during sober periods makes me realize the damage all the drinking and smoking does to my body as I see my stamina go up real quick by a lot  This is a great motivator for me and physical evidence of all the extra energy not drinking gives me  If I keep this up  I should be able to run 8 to 10k again within a few weeks  during drinking periods I can run 3k max  totally exhausted     It also seems that stopping drinking at these times is socially acceptable and even admired no questions asked  it is seen as a strength   Where do you live         Day 2  Feeling rough  Not drinking today  Oh I thought you were gonna say go to the saunas and blow old Nazis for war memorabilia he can auction off for booze money and then when he pounds bottom shelf vodka instead of sweet jager it won't taste so bad because he's used to the foul taste of German old man jizz and because he's dehydrated from sauna sweating the booze will hit that much faster  Then reap the ultimate reward   the sweet release of death  I will not drink today  Productive day yesterday  and lots on my plate today  Bring it on  Glad to hear that  thanks a lot    There will be days when you question why you stopped gaming  when your life has improved already and you think you can start again  Especially when you lack the motivation you have to be disciplined to go on  because that's when you really begin to change  and find alternatives to gaming   IMO I will not drink today   Second that  very Trainspotting of you   Well done  I see people here agreeing with you  and I do to  I made a simular post a few days back because some random soft porn appeared on instagram randomly  Well I was scrolling trough search wich means people you dont follow appear there  I think Instagram is fun because I follow only friends and family and trust me  I was an anti socialmedia type of guy  I dont think you have to unnistall instagram just unfollow every model  I'm going back to bed    I never set out to expose frauds on reddit  just happened that way    I don't even want any of this bullshit  but they probably shouldn't be allowed to continue    Maybe you guys care  I dunno    See you in 8 hours    Do what you will  Still chugging along  SO glad I didn't cave on NYE  I will not drink today  Congrats on your decision  Day 2 for me too    And already feeling much better than I have felt in a while    non hungover mornings are so good    I will not drink with you today  That's 1 8 liters  btw Pancreatitis also spurred me to quit  Mine wasn't nearly as serious as yours  thank goodness  It was just starting due to gallbladder issues  It scared me so much that I stopped cold turkey and haven't looked back  So glad you are on the road to recovery   Thats pretty much where I am now  Tired of not feeling well  in a fog  Ive been diagnosed with depression by a few doctors and I think that makes things worse just because I don't have the mental energy most people do  that in turn makes me give up on things I should follow through on  then nothing to do  then boredom  then do the easy things and drink myself to sleep  Everyday stuff just feels daunting  even keeping a small group of friends around or finishing a degree  I just know that I don't want to waste anymore of my time in that state of mind  Thanks for the input  Alcohol is not on my side of the battle lines either  I won't drink with you today   I will not drink today    Yup  I'm in for both  Good luck buddy  Some things I do to keep myself busy  non alcoholic here    as computers are my source of income and hobby  then it's obvious  video games  tons    programming  reading about   learning new IT stuff  then comes internet  I read quite a lot about space exploration or science in general  watch documentaries  TED talks  educational youtube videos or movies on the subject  yeah  movies  I watch like 2 3 good ones a week  or some tv series  southpark    I also play guitar  not much as I want to though   sometimes do some papercraft or similar model building  also I love to cook  I hate to clean the apartment but I have to do it from time to time anyways      also I pick up a good read  being it some boring science article or any book comics   I watch read news to keep up with latest domestic world events  get out for a walk  do some exercises  yoga   or I just sit on the sofa and pick my nose       and reddit  of course     I definetly agree  But I think everyone else does too  They werent "agaisnt" you  it was just an idea the programmers and the mods didnt have  I will not drink today no matter what  So there's a difference between advice and the key to stopping  Imho the key to stopping is wanting to and having the guts to do it  Now my advice is simply get away from anything pot related  physically speaking  Train yourself to leave the area if friends or strangers are smoking even if it's only for a while  Eliminate all potential temptation  Also don't hit rock bottom like I did  It's really not necessary  especially if you already know you want to quit  I will not be drinking with you today   Good luck   Sometimes nerves are a good thing  I will not drink today  You are right  respect people who respect you     How about showing some respect and having a grateful heart for them allowing you to live there  Stop using them as an excuse for your drug problem   Your parents arent allowing you to live there  Its their responsibility to feed you  put a roof above your head  They are responsible for you at 17  Hi spiral   I was also a lying drinker   I hid my drinking for nearly four years   I finally got to the point where he isolation was too much   I also realized I was no longer in control   Welcome and I will not drink with you today     A binge eating problem    Coursework    Issues with my ex    Biggest   that I needed to deal with being transgender and actually transition Hi everyone  good morning  I'm not drinking today  Thanks for the info  so far Ive been 3 days without anything  no withdrawal effects luckily  Maybe a little grumpy but nothing serious  You're definitely right about finding new friends though  all Ive done with them for the past few years is drink and party  So I guess the solution is find new friends with similar interests outside of drinking right  The medication I cant really do without  I currently work  12 hour midnight shifts and without them I would never get any sleep  I would like to move to a job during the day but the benefits and pay at my current job are really just too important for me right now  Other than drinking though I think Im pretty healthy  I eat my fruits vegetables  have an overall healthy diet  What tea do you use to help sleep  I would like to try that too  Thanks for the input   Thank you  Just from experience  I'm guessing you're sort of low balling your use  60 90mg a day while not terrible  is still probably 4 6 months of use  Enough to tell that you'll most likely go back after running out and getting sick  So  Coming from someone who has gone through both oxy and sub addiction for 5  yrs   Buy the kratom first and make sure it's from a reputable source    Wait till your withdrawing and try 3 5g of Kratom to make sure it's enough to get rid of WDs  but not get you high   As soon as the WD fades  Flush the rest of the pills  Get your mind right  You won't need these with kratom   Take the kratom only as needed  for sleep or very bad WDs  Do NOT get in a regimen besides perhaps a dose when you wake up and before you goto sleep  Once you start rationalizing and saying  'well i can cut back from 6x a day to 3''  is when you'll think of kratom as your next drug   Do this for a week with kratom  then toss it  Get in good habits of going to the gym  eating healthy  and not abusing alcohol or drugs   If you're not taking more than 15g a day  it should be totally doable and you won't be withdrawing much   Finally  start going to some meetings or something to supplement your mind   Of course in a perfect world  I'd say go cold turkey  But this isn't a perfect world and certainly not a perfect disease  For me going to a psychiatric ward helps  I was bulimic for several years and thinking that I got this and would ween myself off it soon  but never did  I self admitted and stayed for three weeks  Costly I know but in the long run thinking about all the food that is wasted it was worth it  I hope you can find help soon before it goes on for any longer   Wow   thanks for relating this because it's hard to imagine getting to such a terrible state     and yet as we all know  it's really very easy   It's one day at a time of saying I'll stop drinking tomorrow  and then tomorrow etc   Thank you so much for your honesty and you have stopped me from drinking tonight   I am going out to get some fuel for my car and the temptation was there to go to the bottle shop while I'm out     but I won't now  I will not drink today  I will NOT drink today     I reckon that sounds about as good as it could have done when you tried drinking again  It reaffirmed the reasons you quit without a huge disaster  Sounds like you've got a good friend there  Welcome back   Not drinking with u     I am with you right now  I have finally realized that I am so very angry at my husband that not even his sobriety can fix it   His sobriety is always a lie anyway   Whether it lasts a day  a week  a month  or a year   the lie always comes back   Nothing can save my relationship now  I will not drink today  I'm in  Thank you for sharing  This was where I was heading and I'm so happy I was able to stop  Congratulations on your sobriety and new found health   It will ALWAYS be your fault   I am just learning this   It doesn't make it easier knowing that   but it will always be YOUR choices that get the blame   Never his  Ever   Stand strong   For yourself  Same to you   I was thinking about you    You beat me to it     pulls out dick  starts measuring  This subreddit has helped me so much   Reading you guy's posts make me realize that I am not alone   I am not crazy   I am not to blame   Thank you  I'm not sure because both times I stopped I was so sick for about 5 days but I think it was because I pretty much poisoned myself on my binges  And had the worst anxiety  physical but I believe due to my distant black outs so the anxiety had cause  Hmm come to think of it I wonder if it was some kind of withdrawal  Not too much help there for you  I think ten days is the time your body will have no alcohol left and t should be much better physically from there  Keep it up   What specifically  I despise all the clickbait  memes  'tagging pictures if your name is X'  political opinions and sponsored ads   Amusingly they still have conscription national service over there  It's a pile of shit  fucking bunch of rabble  but what else can you expect from a bunch of teenagers  Anyway I think all the Nazi stuff was looted  the fucking swastika is illegal there now  You can do it  Mad Props  I'm doing a drynuary and then re evaluating  need this sub to help me do it  Sign me up  Tapers  while a novel idea  usually fall face first   More importantly  withdrawals are the easy part  The harder part comes on day x  when you feel better and convince yourself that you did a good job and you deserve a pill today  Just 1 though of course   You know it and I know it   Either commit to the WDs and going clean or go on a maintenance program  You want the best of both worlds here  and it's probably not going to happen   Sorry  but have to be realistic  Thank you   I'm going to follow your example and make that promise every day 'just for today '  Congratulations on a year   It's my ex girlfriends birthday today  Hell  it's a stretch to call her an ex girlfriend really  We were just very close friends with benefits  The amount of drama I went through with her could be a novel  The pre fwb  the during  and the post   it could genuinely be a book    I sincerely believed I loved her and I still dont think I can recreate that feeling with anyone else  She was the girl Leonard Cohen would write about  We don't talk anymore  but there's no negative feelings  we said merry Christmas  She seems to be doing quite well  It's been 2 years and I think about her all the time  Today  obviously  I'm thinking about her more    There's not much I wouldn't give to spend another night with her    but I wouldn't give up my booze    Cheers  and miserable Monday to you all  This is a big one  Let's do this   sign me up  Thanks for sharing  I feel the same and decided to quit in order to start feeling alive again  to feel and understand clearer    Best of luck and cheers for clean 2017 hes american he wont understand metric unless its converted to drams and gills  Good advice and very true  I managed a bit more sleep and feel better now   I've had some odd dreams up till now  never anything like that  It was just so crazy how real it felt waking up  so sure I was actually awake this time  I guess I have a lot more of this to look forward too   Happy new year to you too    Halfway to 90 days today  Which is halfway to 180 days  Which is halfway to a year  I will drink alot of green tea and green smoothie today but no booze  Love  Checking in Yes  that is why I wanted to know other's opinions too   It is your personal issue and you have to sought it out it's self and If a person really care for you want to protect you then i personally suggest you please don't let him go  Right here with you    Good luck  I'm not drinking today  I had debated theses past  4 months about posting this story  I'm more of a lurker than a contributor  Inspiring you to avoid drinking  even if it's only for a day   that makes sharing so worthwhile    I just turned down another line  this is more than just turning down lines because I know if i would have taken it I would have spent my entire  3000 check i just got Agreed Also  this may help some people from binging  if someone relapsed  that doesn't means their progress resets too  That time still counts  This would help  as people sometimes think  now that I've relapsed  I may view it for sometimes more  but doing that will increase their relapse counter and no one would want that  Good Job  OP especially with the flight anxiety   Anime frequently becomes an addiction no better than gaming     There's not much I wouldn't give to spend another night with her    but I wouldn't give up my booze   Good  I was beginning to worry about you      I had a relationship like that once  All I can tell you is after 25 years  it doesn't hurt as bad    I remember this feeling so well  I found immense relief that this would be the last time I ever felt that feeling again  If ever I want to drink again I just remember that feeling  Oh and loosing all my stuff too  The worst  Well I didn't drink and I had a lovely evening   Umm    Drynuary  Drybruary  Drarch  Drapril  May  Drune  dry July  Draugust  Dreptember  Droctobober  Nothanksvemeber  Drycember   Hi there  Just wanted to tell you that you aren't alone  I also had a massive habit for a longtime  I  too  am was scared of my brain  Hell  no one knows us like we know ourselves and that mental piece and fear kept me a slave for a longtime  I did exactly what you are doing  tapered  I tapered 93 days in total  The first week I cut 2 3 of my dose and waited to ADJUST  Took about 5 days  That was the worst of it  after you adjust at 20g  slow down  You don't have to torture yourself  I jumped  really I would call it a step off  it was shockingly easy  at 2 5g  5doses a day   0 5g  and it REALLY was ok  No crazy crying after that first week or two  I am telling you  you will be OK  Don't let the fear trick you  You can do this  Keep chipping away at it and before you you it  it's done  The glimpse you see of your old self will start to increase and you will see the old you get a foot hold and the old Kratom brain move out  This requires discipline and the want to quit  Sounds like your ready  Let me us know if we can help  Congratulations on making up your mind to quit  Keep your head up  Hey hey westyman  Good to have some more company for the trip      I'm not drinking right along with you  mate  I'm genuinely happier to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all  She took me places I never thought I could go      That's enough melodramatic whining from me  a real miserable Monday problem has just reared its head  I thought I had another bottle of whiskey  I don't   It got harder before it got easier  5mo just happened to be the hardest time for me thus far  I couldn't drink but I was miserable  I didn't have the tool yet to react differently to life so I was creating the same problems for myself and then blaming them on external factors   Somewhere around that time the Joe and Charlie speaker tapes taught me about resentments  I look at how that played out in my life as a spiritual breakthrough of the educational variety today  I came to believe that someone might wrong me but Everytime I replay that wrong in my head it's on me  That as much as anything else helped me deal with my war PTSD but also I think it might have been the start of the first time in my life where I've ever truly taken responsibility for my own emotions   Anyway  I was hoping someone like you was out there  Want to stay in touch   I was in your situation a little over two years ago   This sub and AA helped me get and stay sober  How big are you  I could never see myself putting that much down a day  despite my best efforts anything over a litre usually puts me to sleep  I can't second this enough  Doing tasks when I was having cravings  or was bored  or when I feel helpless got me through  and still does today  Some people work out  I clean  Early on when my mind wouldn't leave me alone and all I wanted after work was to drink I would swiffer the floors like they'd done me wrong instead  It burns off energy  refocuses my thoughts  and my house gets clean    Thanks for sharing  to all those starting out  I concur this helped me a lot   You're right about this  but I can only delay watching when I truly believe that the relapse will bring negative effects  When I'm very lonely and I'm procrastinating on my study  it's easy to fool myself  Mastering the art of resisting comes from doing something else to procrastinate on watching porn  Most of us watch porn to procrastinate on something else  All the stuff you just mentioned but also girls guys getting pictures uploaded of them doing shit so that they appear 'perfect' and that their lives are awesome  You know like constantly uploading pictures up like that You're words are my little bit of confidence right now  Thank you  Nope  not gonna do it   I will NOT drink with you today   Go ahead and ban me by IP     Such a joke  I can see you have no clue how any of that works by posting this  I'm a really unstable drunk  If something good happens I'm loving it  everything is my friend and everyone is a wonderful person  If something bad happens  I'm a moody and miserable piece of self harming shit    I've never hurt anyone while drunk  physically  anyway  besides myself  Defining success as "not drinking today" might help you build the confidence you say you lack  If you're peering too deep into the calendar  a week from now  a month  holy shit am I really not going to drink for the next decade       these imaginations of the distant future make confidence difficult  But just today  just this evening  I'm SURE you can do that    Days    Yet I'm not selling shit   Have you ever attempted this before     How long have you been binge drinking and the approximate amounts during these binges   I like this model  it still shows the progress and allows you to go "aw darn  my average went up  let's work hard to keep it down again"  rather than "fuck  I lost all my progress and the motivation to build up a streak again"  You also forgot to mention FebFast February   My suggestions  don't know if any of them are original      Parched March   Abstinence April    Moderation May  I pulled a rookie mistake yesterday and it truly hurt my soul  I ordered a 20oz Hefe and I was sipping it super slow  Next thing I know the check comes  I pack up the doggy bag and we leave  Forgot to finish half of my beer   Wtf  How does that happen   I beat myself up all day over it   Feeling a bit forlorn about the passage of time  but that won't be an excuse to drink today  Just picked up my 30 day chip  Good or bad  I will not drop no today   Oh  you poor thing  you're in a lot of pain  I'm so sorry you're going through this   Please don't make any irreversible decisions right now while you're in turmoil   Can you please call a helpline  I am not sure where you are  but there is a list of numbers  at https   www reddit com r SuicideWatch wiki hotlines  sorry  I don't know how to link   or perhaps speak to someone via the IRC on the sidebar   The only thing I can say is that you are NOT alone   So many people here have been in similar situations and have found a way out   It really can get better for you  this is not all there is   Please don't be ashamed or embarrassed   You have clearly recognised a problem and you've spoken up about it   that's incredibly brave and very very smart     Please stay here  read some of the posts  and keep posting yourself   You're not alone  we're here and no one will be judging you   Strong work right here   Is there someone in 3D you can talk to  Your doctor  A therapist    Suicidal thoughts should not be taken lightly and drinking causes depression  Believe me  I've felt what you're feeling and I believe it's a sign that you must do something different   it's a viscious cycle   You feel sad and depressed so you drink to feel better  You get drunk and do something you regret nd feel worse the next morning so you drink again    Wash Rinse Repeat   The cycle MUST be broken    Will you join me in not drinking today  Good shout  Only concern is  sometimes the high number has been enough to make me think twice about breaking it  I still think what you are suggesting is worth serious consideration  those are the situations I am most afraid of   Great job   Green Tea somehow does the trick   Happy 2017   Give it time   Didn't they just outlaw muslim garb  Have you noticed that your hangovers become less severe  when you don't smoke  Thank you for your reply  I went to AA for a few weeks around 5 years ago and you know what  I actually listened to the stories of other people and my fucked up mind believed I couldn't be an alcoholic cause I didn't do half the shit they had done  so therefore gave my self a pass to continue drinking  I like your idea of us both going tomorrow   I need to get through today and be strong enough to stay off alcohol tonight when I start to feel a bit better as this is when i will inevitably mess up and I dont want to  How have you managed your last 12 days  well done for that      My husband isn't as terrible as I may have led you to believe  He is very nice  he always thinks he's doing the best in every situation  I know that our daughter means more than anything to him  He has a job where he works completely alone in A pitch black basement for 11 hours a day for almost no pay  and he is almost definitely somewhere on the autism spectrum  Those two things together make for a somewhat stressful home Get rid of all your stuff and from then on if you think about  or have a craving  immediately try to recognize that and think of something else  Anything  Preferably something that you could be doing instead of smoking and go do it  Every time wanting to smoking pops into your head  just force yourself to shift your train of thought  Before you know it  you'll remember what it's like to live without it   I will not drink today  I will not drink with all of you here today  Proud to say my  my wife's and my  holiday season went as planned  Consequently I have nothing to say sorry for  nor am I embarrassed for any actions  deeds  or words said  If near 10 months of sobriety has taught me anything  and its taught me a lot  it has taught me that the world  I live in  is a  much  better place for my being sober  The problem with that is that I could be well over a year in days "pornfree" as I normally only looked at porn 2 3 times a week when I wasn't trying to kick it  That doesn't put me anywhere near where the people are who have gotten to 1 year  and it wouldn't put me anywhere close to a streak or actually removing porn from my life  So I will gladly reset my counter to 0 if I relapse again because I have reset my brain back to feeling the need of porn again  The counter wouldn't mean anything to me if I only lost a day when I relapsed  For me day 5 is when I feel good both physically and mentally  First 100 hours will be the worst feeling for me  Just hang in there  it does get better  Congratulations  that is a big deal man  If you don't mind me asking how long much did you smoke  I wonder if the amount and length of time of use before stopping is what is dragging out some people's physical recovery vs others  They didn't pack that in your doggy bag as well  I'd say the onus is on the eating establishment  I will not drink today   Good question  I still feel a sense of shame when thinking back on my lowest moments and I think to keep a small amount is healthy  But if it's all consuming the only thing I've found is time helps  and the longer I'm sober the better I feel about the things I did in the past because I redeem myself through not drinking  Even if it's just trying to stop and needing to try again and again you should feel proud you're doing something to change  That means you've learnt from your mistakes   Wow  that's amazing   Not only are you going to make 2017 a great year for yourself  you're going to be helping so many people as well   Congrats on the decision to do the course  And thank you  I know we already benefit from your wisdom and empathy

lost than to have never loved at all   Absolutely    It was an epic post I will join you all in not drinking this January 2  2017   Thanks for your comment  It's reassuring to see someone who realized what alcohol did to them and took action  Is life much happier now  Or  should I say stable  Feel like I'm a lost cause right now   I will  not drink today  no matter what   I will not drink today  On

cannot seem to find one I like  I use this and other subs like it to act as a sponsor  Probably not the best way to do it  but it is working for me    So glad you made the decision to NOT drink   It's a link to a well respected vendor and I even mentioned the daily list of vendors so people can do their owm research on where yo buy  Interesting idea  but it may over complicate the system  Also  I would personally reset relapse counter after maybe a year   Also  in some ways it makes a big deal out of relapse  that number staring at you  So it might mean you have less immediate relapses  But it could become a millstone  when a relapse isn't supposed to be the big deal   Thanks so much  Some great people on this sub  Right now I feel like rock bottom  but In truth  I've had so many rock bottoms over my life that i am so sick of it   I'll do it now  Better late than never   I think it the other way around Resetting  to zero upsets you too  On the other hand you could look at your progress and be proud of all the days where you did achieve your target   Also  similarly  if you'd be watching porn  you'd be willingly incrementing your relapse counter  It would be a real time realization of that you made that thing to increase  Sober Living is the BEST    I will not drink today   In  Not drinking today   That I'm an alcoholic  Thank you for your kind reply  I spoke with samaratins 2 weeks ago when I had made the decison that i couldn't live like this anymore  They were very nice but they can't change the way a persons mind works so ultimately the thoughts remain  I dont cope with things the same as other people and small things that happen push me to the edge  with only my children keeping me from falling completely  I have no doubt that my shame around drinking doesn't help one bit   I want to stop so badly  I'm just so scared of failing again     Try Sober Voices Phone Meetings 712 432 0075 Pin  654443  Everyday at 12 00pm EST   Evening at 10 00pm EST  I

physically addicted   I didn't know this and was still locked in denial when I quit sobstayee in bed for two weeks      I don't have comparable dry goods experience and the thing is every one is different so is what  our bodies tolerate    If I knew then what I known now I think rehab would have been a wise move  But I lucked into my sponsor and things worked out ok  I do have a talent for

come to see  Chairs bud Thanks for sharing  This is such a baffling and cunning disease   That we would knowingly put alcohol in our bodies thinking we are hurting no one else when we were hurting so many     In my opinion experience  quitting is something you have to decide to do on your own  Your brother may have to hit rock bottom and have some realizations before he decides to quit    Just don't give up on him  This post somewhat reminds me of myself  weed really did make me depressed and irritable every time I wasn't high  My boyfriend has hated my smoking for the past year  and after being 10 days sober I wonder how many fights would have been avoided if weed wasn't in the picture  Your post is quite eye opening  thank you and good luck to your brother  Yes  I Agree about the high numbers  instead here we would we increasing the value of relapse counter And no one would want that too reach a high value  Maybe you could go back and we if they kept it for you  Fuck That Shit  You're handling it better than I would haha  I wouldn't be happy with that at all  Respect   Thank you so much and right now drinking is the last thing I want to do  I need to find some strength to keep feeling this way and not to give in again  It is a vicious circle  depression drinking feeling shame  its also a massive habit  I am so used to drinking every evening it feels like a part of me is missing if i try not to  and I struggle to sleep if I'm not passed out from alcohol I am going to give it everything not to drink today  That's good to know  I felt great yesterday but maybe it was a mind over matter  I was so proud of myself for not drinking on NYE that my body felt great as a result of that     Today perhaps my body had decided to take more control of the situation    I had a shower and that helped considerably and boy  how good it felt to be able to wash off a phantom hangover as opposed to temporarily masking a real one with a cold shower only to have it come back tenfold an hour later    Thank you for your assistance   We got some Wanker in our sub fap  Been here  a few months  and now its OK to go around attacking Fash and  I  Nerve of some people   It took

can make you want to rip your hair out like a crazy person  and at the same time be the most awesome thing ever  I had no idea what being a parent was really like  So serious cudos to you Triple Jack  keep at it  I'll not drink with you today  Day 2  not drinking today  Waking up without a hangover fely amazing today and I don't want to lose that feeling tomorrow  I found that drinking masked my problems    Just because I got sober didn't mean I got a pass  I had to front up to all my financial stuff and the wreckage of my career    Luckily I was single   no kids     Have you found r alanon  That sub is full of folks who have been where you are  Nothing beats brown sauce   HP   it has to be HP   on a hotdog  Not sure if it's around where you are  certainly hope so  As an atheist   lol  I love that line  I'm appropriating it for future use  The nightly quantity isn't too extreme  but doing that every day is enough to wreck your liver if you are so disposed    ill have to figure out what to pack for a trip also wd and out of beer and only one shite benzo left  also got another email from mom that iam disappointment  That star looks great on you  Congratulations  To celebrate  I won't drink with you today   Back on the wagon after a bump in the road knocked me off last week  Not drinking  though  Fake I'm not so far in myself  so please take my advise with a pinch of salt   Unfortunately he really has to make the first step of his own accord  Pot may or may not be the cause of his depression  but he's certainly trying to use it to run from it   After a long time of smoking I admitted it was actually just making it worse  i was constantly zoning out picking myself apart  replaying scenarios in my head and beating myself up for my actions  Depression is really excarcebated by this  because you're not living in the moment    When he decides to quit again  make plans with him  keep him busy  away from his friends  the first few days are probably the hardest for cravings  For me it was mostly boredom or stress that makes me want to smoke  But after a week without it I saw objectively for the first time that smoking isn't going to make that better  You don't own trousers  One cannot survive in the penguin costume full time   at some stage it'll need a wash  I shall look forward to day ten in that case  and all the days after    It was relatively mild in comparison to what you seem to have gone through I think  Well done on making it out the other side    I guess we like to assume that stopping drinking will automatically mean we wake up on day one and everyday after feeling like daisies and with a spring in our step    The harsh reality is after years of abuse our body  and mind  is going to punish us for taking away what it craves and we'd be fools to expect we'll get an easy ride    But I'm ready for the ride   I went end of 2015 twice  but haven't since  The person I saw was starting to see things I didn't want to admit to and I stopped going  2016 then went to shit right away  I know I need to go again   I will not drink today And to attack you about your subject expertise as well  Dumb  Simply dumb  Dunno  if they did then that's a really stupid decision  Ok that makes sense  maybe it could also mask emotional problems but then how could you really tell I guess  Ah no I haven't but I will check it out  Thank you  I'm sorry to hear what you are going through  What about opening up to your brother and telling him how you feel  Is that an option  Inspiring For me  the fear of failing is huge   It's terrifying  almost so much that I couldn't even think about not drinking because I was scared that failure was inevitable and would tip me over the edge   It seems that for a lot of people here  myself included   alcohol misuse accompanies depression and other mental health issues   I know that I drink to avoid the depression etc  and I know that drinking also makes it so much worse   So it's hard to but the breaks on a cycle like that   Are you able to see a doctor about your drinking and how you're feeling about things at the moment   They may be able to help with support to detox  perhaps you can explore medication options as well   I did that a few weeks ago and it was terrifying  but worth taking that step   You are right that no one else can change the way your mind thinks  but there are tools and resources that can help you work through it yourself  It is possible to change the way you think  it really is  Congratulations on 72 hours  For me  it's been a journey of removing reminders of smoking as they come up  like if I'm taking a flight  I'll sometimes suddenly get a craving even it it's been some time since I quit  so be patient with yourself after this time as you may still find you are triggered to want a smoke out of the blue  If smoking was triggered by stress I like tinybuddha com to find articles to help me through  I would think so   but this is just my opinion   if THC is stored in your fat working out releases them into your bloodstream yes  but guess who comes next  Kidneys   excretion    So yes working out right before a test is a bad idea because you are releasing the THC  however doing it well ahead of a test OR when you don't care about a test would be a great way to get it out of your system    Also   I am training for a marathon right now and the running has been bringing up tons and tons of phlegm and tar from smoking and I can't think that this is anything but good    that shit shouldn't be in your lungs lol   I would cite this  I feel like a bad scientist not citing  but I'm being lazy so maybe someone else can chime in too     I will not drink today   Here you go  https   www reddit com r stopdrinking search q title 3Abored OR title

best thing out for yourself  I am keeping alcohol on hold  just over a week now  but only two beers in two weeks  and I feel like a different person  It's been a very cool experience   with a pen that had the logo for the medication on it   That's surreal  I would have been wondering if I was in a "Matrix" movie  Yeah  I remember having it a while ago when I was having 'a week of no drinking' that lasted a mere 3 days  and I felt short changed    'but hang on Mr Body  I'm doing a good thing here and I  didn't  pump you full out poison last night so why aren't you making me feel amazing when I wake up  Why do I feel almost as bad '   I guess it has become confused and just assumes it's going to wake up lame and crippled  A placebo effect of sorts    Thank you  It really feels worth it     I'm in  Congratulations on your year  The benefits seem to just keep coming  I am to please   Sometimes I'm just too lazy to post so I just put my story in the comments of someone else's   I'm now officially out of booze but duck it's Monday so I can always get more   A break is in order though as my livers starting to really hurt   Looking forward to a weed and Xanax filled day   Oh but those nips from the bottle were delightful and the Packers won yesterday and are the NFC champs      Oh but didnt you hear Fash and I are lying about that cause society just loves  CA  Junkies  It opens so many doors  for us that we cruise Reddit looking for shit to do  Unfuckingreal  I really hope hes ashamed of himself  And  Im not causing shit on Fash's oh wait your thread  haha by exposing him  Shit  he probably doesnt even know the History of this post even  Thank you    You are doing the right thing  Keep on being awesome  It likely has a lot to do with duration  quantity  body mass and metabolism  Your body has to process it like anything else  and it takes a while  However  it's the mental re wiring that takes the longest  You went from weed    happy to       happy to  good habits and decisions    happy   The stress is piling in a vicious way    but I won't have a drink today   This made me laugh  Thank you for your post  Gets me thinking SOBER  Day 6  I won't drink with you today   I am with you  Had a bit of a hard time falling asleep last night  but waking up felt good  I think it was just the face coverings that were outlawed   But I still find it hypocritical for a country that won't let you name your kid Adolf  Watery eyes reading your post  I see this is how it works  Call me sensitive but Im freaking happy for you and for us   Happy 2017 for us  I wont drink with you today  He actually wrote about it in his autobiography    along with many rants fueled by his use of LSD  I'd take the whole thing with a grain of salt   I will not drink today  Plus it's time to start counting calories and dropping these 30 or so pounds I really don't need   Well not everything can be flawless There's some good and there's some bad   I think  this will help us focus on the good  Hey  thank you so much  I've had counselling before but I'm definitely going to look into it again  In the past I was quite resistant because it bought bad memories into the present which id rather forget  but obviously burying things doesn't work otherwise I wouldn't be drinking so much  I can definitely relate to the 'just having a good time' thing too   Exercise is the best thing I can do to help myself  it's like a healthy form of self harm  lol  Happy and healthy life is definitely what I'm after  Thank you for sharing your experience with me x  Incredible  Congratulations on a year    Congrats on your year of keeping your promise to yourself  It has been a pleasure to be sharing this journey with you   I've done quite a bit of digging around and have come to my own conclusion that this is talking specifically about sociopaths  psychopaths  schizotypal people or just people with such a low IQ that they don't know the difference between right and wrong  Typically people who are acutely mentally disturbed disabled and continue to be so after they quit drinking   The Big Book was written about 4 years after the founding of "Alcoholics Anonymous"  Over those fours years they had hundreds if not thousands of men and women come to a very small number of AA groups and try the 12 steps  Because AA was not like it is today   widely published and promoted by rehabs and doctors   in the early days they'd only get "low bottom" alcoholics who had tried everything else and were desperate enough to gladly submit themselves to the rigours demanded by the 12 step program  Consequently from these desperate people they got really good results  it was very rare for someone to fail   to go back to drinking  But very occasionally they'd have a fellow come to the meetings with what we would call today an acute personality disorder or acute learning difficulties   In my seven years of recovery I've bumped into one or two  This is out of the many  many hundreds that I have seen come and go at several thousands AA meetings that I have attended  The 12 steps will never work for people who don't feel any guilt or remorse  who don't have any resentments  "Children of the Lie" M Scott Peck calls them  They are just not capable of the type of self examination required in step 4 and the on going self examination step 10 calls for  They simply cannot see how selfish they are  I once tried to sponsor one such individual  He had a drinking problem alright but he also had an acute personality disorder  He was literally unable to understand what to do in step 4  He simply didn't have the cognitive ability   in other words he was "constitutional incapable of being honest with  himself "  It wasn't his fault   "he was just born that way" as the Big Book put's it  But he was very much the exception  not the rule   Skip through a few pages until you get to page 65  Can you understand the table  Could you write something like that about the people in your life  Now turning over the page to page 67 third paragraph  can you put out of your mind the wrongs others have done to you and see your own mistakes  If you can answer yes then you are capable of being honest with yourself and the twelve steps could work for you  Whether or not they will work for you is an entirely different matter and rather depends on whether or not you choose to work them   most alcoholics myself included for many many years preferred to drink rather than work the steps   I have had other sponsees and many of them also fail at step 4 but it's not because they don't understand what to do  rather they just don't seem to be desperate enough  In time though  after a few more years under the lash of alcoholism many do come back with the desperation I eventually had to put pen to paper and they also make a start on actually doing the steps rather than pontificating over them  Sure  of course  All of the ones I had been avoiding by staying drunk for years  And the ones that staying drunk for years had caused   By being sober  I was making a choice to join the adult world  and start taking care of the issues before they explode into real problems   We call it "Cleaning up the wreckage of the past" and it is part of step 5   Once my head was clear enough to recognize the problems  I was able to handle them   It is part of the promises  "We will intuitively know how to handle situations which used to baffle us"   For you  however  I would HIGHLY recommend r alanon  It will not keep your Boyfriend sober  but it will help YOU deal with his being a drunk  Man  I totally get this post  My two kids are beyond bonkers at this point  and they don't go back until next Monday  I used to drink all the time after being triggered by my kids  Glad I don't have to do that these days  I usually have to walk out of the room for a few minutes and take a few deep breaths  or make a tea or something like you did  Congrats on 70  3XJackontheRocks  I had to focus on the similarities in other people's stories and not the differences  The differences are just my "yets"  the things I haven't done yet  I will not drink today  Will do  Thank you again  May I suggest reading "the naked mind"  It's not your fault you drink too much  The book will explain  You can change before anymore harm to you is done  I'm supporting you  We all are   I won't drink with you today   I will not drink today  The good thing about not drinking  is that you can react to those situations in much better ways when you're sober  as compared to when you aren't   Nope   Been binging over 10 years  Approximate amount varies  3 bottles of wine to whole bottles of vodka   Yes we can  I'm aiming for 30 days too coz then I hope the habit is broken    Edit  not suggesting I'll start again after 30 days  Just want a less scary goal for now   Congratulations on the new job  and thank you for the work you do  Thanks for being here and sharing your experiences with us too   I will not drink today no matter what happens  Found it on Amazon   I'll give it a try and report back   No more fiends in 2017  Hear  hear  Hey  I've tried the EMDR too  I think it definitely helped some of the trauma from being so 'emotional' and freed me to be able to talk about my experience objectively  In the past I was resistant to counselling because it bought back memories but I now realise if I'd just dealt with those feelings at the time I probably wouldn't of dragged them around for so long  I'm going to look into therapy at work  also I know when I'm working out physically my mental health is sooo much better   Thanks for sharing your experience with me  I really appreciate it    Switzerland is my favorite country  which I have visited in my life   yeah fuckin A that's bang on what happened to me every relapse  I learned there is a quieter  patient  more thoughtful  and considerate person under all the boozy bravado  I learned that when I don't constantly seek other's approval  I leave some space to work on being a better me   I am not drinking today   Staying strong and I will not drink today  In those first few weeks I was googling  "one day sober"  "two days sober"  "n days sober" to see if I was on track  Reading whatever I could  I found r sd around day 20  maybe my google skills as not so good  I had no designs on a dry 2016  just a dry January  I don't know your drinking history  but there is a reason this is called recovery   My mantra in 2016 while kicking alcohol to the curb was "health and wealth"  I got there one day at a time  I won't be drinking w you today  thank you    I have an appointment with my doctor to hopefully get my anti anxiety medication changed  I will not drink today  I've always liked that quote too  I relapsed so many times thinking  "well  shit  I've never really made a huge mess of my life  I've never been arrested  I've never lost my job  wife  house  etc   " I had to learn that everyone has a different bottom  and it all depends on where you stop digging   Oh man  those post alcohol shits   mine smell like nail polish remover or something  yeap shes great though and so was i untill alcoholism  I read a book called "Waiting  A Non Believer's Higher Power" published by Hazelden that really helped me wrap my head around the steps without the God language  I consider myself a pretty strong agnostic and I've been helped tons by AA  by the community aspect but especially so by working the steps  If you are willing to work the steps  you will quickly see what they mean about those who are willing to be honest versus those who aren't  Try talking to a person who is drinking himself to death yet still thinks he doesn't need to change anything about how he lives his life and you will see a man who is incapable of being honest with himself    I promise you  if you go in looking for things to disagree with  you will find them  If you go in looking for things that can help you  you will find them too  I've learned that which ones I focus on is a decision I can make  I for one am glad that I chose to ignore the G word and get to work   Nailed it  Right with you  What will you do differently this time when the urges hit  I'm glad you've figured out the pattern  but that was only half the battle for me  Best wishes  I stayed up most of the night and am now kicking myself because I want to be asleep still  It's so warm under my blanket  '  No one's fault but my own though    I don't know if we have a meeting today because of the holidays etc  I'm going to pull a lazy ass repeat of last Tuesday and just throw a hoodie on and pretend to be presentable  At least my hair looks nice since I dyed it yesterday    All my roommates  none of whom work etc  were asleep by midnight and their lazy asses are still in bed    I'm apparently the only one who gives a fuck that we're supposed to be ready by 0900  Oh well  they're about to get woken up by the lights because it's 0845 and I need to find my clothes    I broke my wonderful streak of two months of no puking  but I think it was a fluke tbh  I took a drink and I guess my brain was not expecting it and I choked and gagged on it and blam  It was not the violent dry heaving I'm used to and I didn't feel sick after so I'm just going to chalk it up to swallowing too much at once  Jesus fuck this entire paragraph sounds bad out of context       I devoured an entire box of the triangle parmesan garlic Triscuits and they cut up the roof of my mouth somehow  Now everything burns    I have to decide today if I'm going to keep my phone with Verizon  which is shitty here and like  15 more  or go switch to metro PCS  no idea how shitty the service is here but it's cheaper   The main dilemma for me is that I actually like this phone and I'm very  very particular about customising my phones and I don't want to give it up now    Aaaaaand I'm procrastinating getting ready  I'm sorry you have that feeling of failure despite all those sober days your rockin' self accumulated   To me  this night sounds like an inadvertant success   After all  you were able to reencounter many aspects of alcohol which now abhor you   And no major harm done  fortunately   I bet you are excited to give this another shot     We are in this together   I won't drink with you today  Have you tried talking to your doctor  You may have a chemical imbalance that could be treated by a different medication  If you are on medication or plan to start medication  especially anti depressants or mood stabilizers  you should be on them sober so you can let your body adjust and know how you feel  Good luck  We're coming for you  Liverpool  You're attack is amazing  but your defense is dogshit  Generally speaking I like Germany  besides Aachen   they're basically the same as the British  Just have the occasional tendency to go insane once in a while   Banning the hijab is a reactionary and disrespectful move though  It's also contrary to their constitution  which is supposed to be based upon the most liberal  freedom of movement and expression laws ever created   I'd be surprised if that's enforced  sounds more like headlines for someone trying to make a name for themselves  Yep  another day Day 6 here  We got this  I won't drink with you today   Checking in  Day 6  I won't drink with you today  I wish I had done this   He told me he shared with his buddies his desire to stop drinking  and it was a repeated lie   In fact  when one of them came over while he was drinking and I referred to his drinking being a problem and a threat to my safety  the friend looked awkward and completely caught off guard   Meanwhile  I was hiding all of this from my friends and family because I was ashamed   I felt so isolated  and I think if it had been out in the open sooner  I would have gotten out sooner  because he just wasn't interested in getting better   Yes  many addicts  mine included  do not want others to know   I would argue that if I had to deal with the consequences of being at the mercy of his untreated  by choice  disease  the least he could do is allow honesty about what I was going through   It would have saved me years of living a double life on his account   Yes  it is likely that he would have refused sharing  but had I thought to bring this up  it would have been the thing that allowed me to stand up for myself when I was feeling so lost and out of control   And if the forced issue of him sharing was his hard line  I would have confronted so much sooner that this was not someone I could be with  the amount of numbers i know back to front is one of my biggest fail points   i couldn't delete them   all the best to you my friend  keep fighting  Abstinence April   I like that   I will not drink today    I didn't force myself to stay in on NYE just to turn around and drink alone two days into the new year     Hope things are getting a little easier for you   Hang in there   We've got your back  Way to go  there's some great honesty here  Defense looked at little better against city but don't disagree that it is the Achilles ankle of Liverpool  yeah netflix marathon FTW  literally only thing i could do for 4 days  too sick to even get up and score   edit  all of the suggestions here are excellent  big fan of loud music  got really into Macklemore on this recent kick  Most of my friends are big drinkers and great people  everyone has been supportive of my quitting  and no one makes a big deal about drinking around me  which  for me  makes it really easy not to drink  The thing is  drunk people suck to be around  My pals and I went out to an event a couple weeks ago  and I had to bail before the after party because by that point everyone's mood had changed  suddenly everyone was very into talking about how bad their childhoods were  everyone was getting a little aggro about misunderstandings  and misunderstandings were happening a lot  because everyone was so focused on their personal drunk crises   All this to say that "fun" drinkers really aren't unless you're one of them  You might find that yourself in my position  extricating yourself from social situations once the same story about your friend's mean mum is told for the fourth time that night  It feels pretty great being sober enough to know when to leave the party  highly recommended     So sorry to hear this  Sobriety might not help get it back  but it will help with this not happening again  Best wishes  Me too   Oh my  me too  One that doesn't always have to worry about my next move   The best  I think Merkel was feeling the heat from her immigration policies and had to throw a bone to the fascists  That is really interesting  thanks for clarifying what it means     I don't do AA  at this stage  but i am not ruling it out   but I started reading the Big Book a few days ago  I figure there's no point dismissing something I haven't read  and so many peole here have gotten value from it  so I'd be silly not to check it out  right     Anyway  I admit I found that notion of being 'constitutionally incapable of being honest with themselves' a bit hard to get my head around  so it's useful to hear your perspective on it   Out of interest  the Big Book is very much written in the style of it's time   do you know if there are any updated interpretations  or newer versions that are worth looking into   Macklemore   Starting Over  Interesting that the urges came back strong after almost half a year   You mentioned that you have made a lot of progress but how are the urges if they arise now and what actions do you take to cope with them  Checking In    Johny Cash   Hurt  I think you mean Nine Inch Nails    Yaaas girl  5 months sounds like forever from where I'm standing  so thanks for the encouragement that it can be done  GO YOU  It's surprisingly easy to quit  just make sure you do something during the times that you normally smoke so you never think about it   I found the benzo quit easier too  Or else I've just forgotten how bad it was  I think I've been so out of it on many of my addictions I didn't have the brain calls left to even accurately observe WD's   I get into this annoying state of mind about kratom  all wine and roses  and start really missing it  Although I've only hit this snag since I ran out of BSO  Have some on order to arrive tomorrow  but I've pretty much decided to track some down at the health food store TODAY  This is ridiculous  I'm right there with you  It's my day 2 also  I will not drink with you today  Yeah  I hate changing phone services  Of course they know that too  Maybe call up Verizon and tell them you are switching unless they offer a discount  Sometimes works    My kids start back at school tomorrow morning    in 23 5 hours   but now   to survive today  Hello fellow empath  I love you  too   I'm so happy neither one of us is smothering our true selves with alcohol right now     I will be sending you loads of healing vibes     And hey  I'm proud of you     Thank you  I considered that last night or the night before I can't remember  but Im just so afraid of admitting this to him or anyone  I am going to get through today and go to AA meeting as soon as I can  Many of us drank heavily for years  then found out that when we were sober we had a big pile of mental problems right in front of our sober faces  Stopping the booze just brought these problems to the surface and forced us to acknowledge them  they were always there  the booze hid the problems  it did not cause them  This is often made worse because alcohol has the effect of stunting emotional growth  leaving many of us as teenagers mentally  I found that being active in recovery forums combined with councelling  exercise  good diet and spending a lot of time reading recovery material helped me a great deal   The fact that he used to drink and now doesn't should not be used as an excuse to treat you poorly   A jerk is a jerk  dry or not   Thanks for the reply  i am fairly new to reddit   I have to sadly admit that I gave in at the last minute   Ten minutes before the liquor store closed I ran over and got a mickey of jager and a small bottle of johnny walker   The hangover was pretty bad   Weirdly enough  I dont feel like a complete failure for drinking   I dont plan on drinking again  but the lure of new years eve got to me    In those first two months of sobriety I had thick brain fog that forced me to keep lists to remember many trivial types of things  My brain fog lifted on day 53  Best wishes  Well fuck  that defeats my whole argument  Cheers to your mom  Joel MAtip is pretty good at Centre back  And  you still have Steven Caulker  a Tottenham youth trained defender    and for some reason Caulker never gets gametime  like never  It's so weird  because he's a very good defender   What would I do in that situation when I already had therapy for 4 years and just had my last session  In my country I am now required to have a 2 years break before I can start seeing any therapist again   I basically feel the same as OP  I have recently doubled my SSRI dosage after about 3 years on the same dosage  as told to by a doctor    its been about 3 weeks since i doubled the dosage though thought they shouldve taken effect by now I'm at work  with no coffee  no food  cause the cafe is closed today  on what should be a corporate holiday   But the supreme overlords dictated that we have to be here   So I will take it  spend time reading random stuff in reddit  and sleep with my eyes open   But I won't drink today     FTZ   One thing I'm starting to appreciate is that a constitution means whatever the people who are willing to ignore it want it too mean if they are in the majority   Consider Japanese internment camps in the US  I will not drink today  Hey  that isn't how drug tests work dude   Read the directions for it   A faint line means that you PASSED   The line is either there or it is not there   It is a 1 or a 0   A yes or a no   The line being faint doesn't mean there was "some" opiates in your urine   At home instant drug tests don't really display nor determine whether there was a little or a lot of the substance present   They display and determine a strict yes or no   A faint line does not mean the presence of opiates   This is a really common misconception   Most people believe that faint lines mean that there was some of the substance present which is not true at all   People need to read the instructions   Please have your girlfriend read the instructions and my post if need be   Please let me know how things work out   Also  eating three poppy seed bagels should not cause you to fail an at home instant drug test   That isn't nearly enough to trigger the test  I know you can do it  I personally listened to recovery podcasts my entire first day and it helped tremendously  I'm almost at a week  no urges whatsoever  and feeling great  Just know that you are not alone in this journey  hmm  sorry to hear that  this is the first time we've tried giving away promo codes for an in app purchase  Its quite a new thing from Apple  How's it going so far OP  Congratulations  This is very inspiring    There's nothing quite as sad as seeing a person stay the exact same after many years  Especially when they don't even enjoy where they are  Lack of personal development  I think Merkel was doing an incredibly humanitarian act  yet some pencil chaser slipped that in on the side   Hey  thank you so much for sharing your story and congratulations on your sobriety  The guilt is what upsets me the most too  I'm lucky to have an amazing partner but that does make me feel all the more bad  But that's also my main motivation for giving up so it works both ways    thanks again   Can I ask why you don't feel comfortable seeking out help from a therapist   Have you been to one before   I'm such a big fan of therapy   Here's why  this is what they have studied for  this is their area of expertise   Friends are amazing  but I don't know that it is fair to ask a friend  presumably close to your age  to be the primary source of comfort and advice about something this huge   Alcoholism  addiction   these are diseases so complex and damaging and distressing that they are fields of study  huge groups have formed in reaction to coping with them  AA  Al Anon    Even my dear friend  who is in her mid 30s and herself married to a recovered alcoholic  simply will not be as good as a therapist because she isn't trained  is very familiar with what worked for her and her husband's situations but not all addiction  and she has a life of her own and problems of her own   I lean on her and she is s source of comfort  but a therapist can offer so much more   Addiction can be ugly and embarrassing and shameful and horrific   Going to tell my therapist about all of those things  is so much easier than sharing all of that with the friend  or watering down the story to make the friend or me feel more comfortable    This isn't going to be easy  I'm afraid  so I suggest getting all the help you can   trusted friends  therapists  Al Anon meetings  read books about being the child of an addict   Do it all  Thank you for your support  it means so much  I will get a hold of this and read it  I read the Alar Carr stop drinking book about a year and a half ago and managed to stop for about a week then gave in to temptation the following weekend after a good bad day just an excuse to drink  I felt such a failure that so many people had managed and yet again I had failed  it was an excuse to drink more  I stopped trying after that until now   Your thoughts on attending AA    I'm not an AA member but was curious on your thoughts of using their method of getting sober  I tried them in the beginning but then went onto creating my own system of re wiring my mind and changing my perception of alcohol   This system works for me  You'll have to find what works for you  You will be dealing with  severe cravings in the beginning  There's no sugar  coating it  As time goes on it gets easier     whyquit com  http   whyquit com john stop smoking cravings tips embracing crave episodes html I had a lot of respect for her as well   Maybe you're right   Maybe it was a compromise as part of a larger package deal   I hope so  Hey  me too  I grew up with alcoholism in my family too  Ironically  despite all the pain it created in my life  I ended up down a similar path  I'm now sober too  Now that I've worked steps though I've become involved in family meetings   There we remind people of the three C's  which are  1   We didnt cause it  it is not our fault that the other person drinks  it is their private battle 2   We cant control it  we have no power over the other person's desire to drink 3   We cant cure it  it is an illness that cannot be cured through any known medical remedies   Getting involved in meetings and stepwork is what saved me from my own despair  Consider actually attending meetings in your area  they may even have AlaTeen depending on where you live   Also therapy with your dad can be helpful I imagine  When I was out using my wife and parents did a couple sessions  It seemed to be helpful and eventually I came to my own place of action  put my hand out  and asked for help   Good luck to you in the new year  This is just like me  I have failed before and I use that as a reason not to try because the failure makes me feel like even more of a useless waste  I am scared of going to doctors  simply for the reason of my kids and job  I couldn't bear to lose either  if I did I would be dead within about a week I'm sure  Im going to try AA again  I can't go on like this anymore  I will not drink with you today  SD  No matter what happens  I will not drink  Day 9  here I come   speaking for myself   my attempts to quit kept me drunk and sick  As hard as it seems  SURRENDER to any power greater than me is the only thing that worked   I don't drink  I surrender  That's it    Tea is my BFF   Add a little honey and mmmmmmm  Proud that you saw the evening for what it was and went to bed sober  I hope everyone is well rested today  I will not drink today  Good morning  I will not drink with you all today  This article makes it sound like she's all for it   http   www bbc com news world europe 38226081 Not going to drink today no matter what life throws my way  Actually  he has already made a post here and we dealt with it in modmail  Your comments in this thread are fine  because it's miserable Monday related  but please keep the drama out of the rest of CA   I know you haven't posted elsewhere in the sub about it  this is just a modly announcement for everyone's benefit   Cheers    I always get sick a week or two after kicking   Thank you for your post  Taking time to inspire another human is an act of LOVE  I'm glad your here 1 2 2017 to share your story to this 6 day girl  Thank you   I won't drink today with you  Remember 1 day at the time   Well  the dosage and amount she's using does in reality matter most of all  The rest of it is subjective moralizing  Sorry  just my two cents   Just try being gentle and understanding with her  And    communicate  It's going to be a great year   You don't have to apologize for the the length of any post  We are so happy to have you sharing with us   Welcome  back  to the ride of your life  and the best group of people to weather through it with   I get the appeal of wanting to do it at home because its more comfortable  but everytime I tried to do it myself I just fell back into old habits after a few days because nothing else had changed    Unfortunately getting out of your comfort zone and being around those strangers might be the best thing for you  it gives you a chance to get information you may not have and to see for yourself what can happen at every stage of the game  I know when i saw the guys who had been at this for 40 years I didnt judge them but I knew I also didnt want that to be my life   Everyones path is different  but growing doesnt happen where your comfortable  Maybe think about trying something outside of it    Either way good luck  and stay strong Great job  momma   No  I have leggings and a few pairs of jeans but they're too big  I prefer dresses etc    But undergarments  I have bras  That's it   I totally trust that  Ahaha     I love you too  I won't drink with you today  Instead I'm going to focus on healing  Stay good to yourself  Happy 2017 Ok  well good luck  The  stopdrinking IRC chat is also a pretty good place to get support  as I am discovering   What a well told inspiring tale  I am glad you are here  Very motivating and inspiring to this sober drunk  Thank you so much  I'm going to just forgo ONE drink   The First One So far cleaning has gotten me through the morning smoke   appreciate the advice    I will not drink today  Hes a Very angry drunk  You guys gotta keep an eye him  And although he called me out you dont see me doing the same  I dont know how thats OK here M  Clear Year  Not sure if it's been suggested as well  but the The 30 Day Sobriety Solution has been amazing for me this time around  I listen to the audio book every day and I follow the steps they give me  I'm amazed at how much easier it's been quitting this time   A fellow SDer recommended it to me on Xmas day and I haven't looked back     I too have three kids  I too used to drink every single nighta bottle plus of wine  Granted  I am only 9 days in today  but I feel so much better  so much more solid  And they can feel that way for you as well   I wish you all the strength and love you need right now  Don't go too hard on yourself  Shame is what often makes us drink so much  Please go get some help  whether it's downloading the book I recommended or reading The Naked Mind or I hear both at the same time works wonderfully   You got this  but you have to want this  Willpower is only part of it  loving yourself and figuring out WHY you drink is also a big part of it   So much love to you  Be good to yourself   I have to remember that every day I don't smoke is a win   It is overwhelming because I feel like I've lost part of my identity    but that is not a bad thing at all  Random drug testing   Kidding  I'm a photographer or something  I will not drink today  I can't believe how much I love my life now that I have left alcohol behind    Thank you all for being here today  Indeed   I only need to see as far as the headlights   and  have Faith in the face of Uncertainty  Powerful post  u DidntDrinkAgain  Thank you for sharing  On the day you checked into the hospital  I was having my last drinks  I'm glad you are recovering  although I'm sorry you are still have some residual side effects  Let's keep this sober journey rolling along  sign me up Just one hour at a time  my friend  You are powerful and can overcome this  We need you here  and the world wouldn't be the same without you   When I notice my Actions  I've prepared my self to consciously choose   Why is there so many excuses for drinking    Because people with alcohol problems are very creative and motivated to find these excuses  I had a million of them  and stayed dependant on alcohol for way to many years    How do you stop the excuse making    Thats the tricky part  If you read as much as you can here at  SD you will find many ways people stopped making excuses and stopped drinking  You can stop drinking if you want to  It is up to only you to do it  not your girlfriend  Your drinking is your choice not anything to do with her    Thanks so much  I'll post again in a few days  Have a crazy busy week that I hope will keep me distracted for the most part   So far just repeating "I don't need this  I don't want this" over and over has been helping as I work past what would normally be my morning blaze  You've got this  Almost there  You lucky bastard  haha  Congrats to you too eh   It's true  I want this  I need to stay focused  When I feel down or ready to cave    I need to remember I wanted this  I will not drink today   Those are some great milestones  congrats   i've been there   hope you're able to replace your stuff with minimal difficulty  Just to follow that thought  and I am not saying I have the answer  by any means   I am clueless myself  just muddling through   I can see how you feel that going to a doctor might affect you keeping your kids and job   But perhaps NOT doing that might lead to the same outcome  or something worse   I can't tell you what to do  but perhaps instead of a doctor  you could talk to your brother   do you trust him to understand and not judge     I know it's tricky with family  so I won't assume he can offer the support you need   you should trust your judgement on that   If nothing else  we're here for you  and coming here is a great start     You're doing brilliantly already just by talking about it  so don't underestimate your bravery or strength   And I will not drink with you today if you want  Been quite a few days now   Feels like an eternity   Seemed impossible at day 3 but getting to visit the family  after a year  has definitely helped too  I will not drink again  I will not drink with you today  I think it's already as cheap as possible  unfortunately  I went around and around with them already because they messed up porting my number and also lied to me about the data  who the fuck sells a smartphone with literally NO DATA  I don't mean it was slow or cost overage fees    My phone literally only got on wifi and had no option for mobile data whatsoever until I gave them an additional  15  Considering I'm on the bus for a few hours a day sometimes  and the buses here don't have WiFi like back home    That was a pretty big issue    I loved Verizon when I had them a few years ago but not so much lately     I relate to all of this op  mostly I'm struggling with a lack of direction  I've never known what I wanted from life  any time anything peaks my interest I get bored eventually and make excuses not to persue it  My brother is vegetarian and used to order McDonalds cheeseburgers without the meat  Also  YOU are not a complete mess  Alcohol has a way of making us believe we are a complete mess  The cycle for me was so simple  drink a lot  pass out  wake up in the middle of the night hating myself because of how much I drank  vow not to drink the next day  wake up with the intention of not drinking  by three PM  I'm at the liquor store because all the negative thoughts about drinking fade away    What is helping me this time is realizing every time I want a drink  and I do   is that happy awesome feeling I get when I initially start  It lasts for such a short time  I spend the remaining time chasing that happy feeling and in turn start feeling even shittier and shittier    It's not you  It's booze    You can do this  I did a sixty day taper  God it was terrible  A couple of great benefits to it though  in that you can  somehow  keep functioning just about  The big benefit for me though was it was so horrible  just the thought of it has stopped me relapsing  Hang in there  You can't force someone else to quit    he has to take the steps himself or it will not work    sorry     I can't drink anymore or I could die  so the decision was easy    Most  heavy drinkers that have to make a change experience  what you're dealing with  Most have to find something to keep them busy for the first few months   Once you take the drinking hobby  out of the equation other interest just seem to pop up     It takes time and it's not easy  Sorry to hear this  but yeah  sounds about par for the course  Kratom is such an absolute bitch   Oh yeah  fancy   I'll look at the schedule  I've enjoyed the evening meetings at Westport Baptist near where you stay  Id for sure recommend   one of my 2017 goals is to attend as many new meetings as possible  so perfect time for you to ask      Then why do you want to quit if it's so great   Check the side bar of this sub  you can download This Naked Mind for free   It sounds like you just went in expecting sobriety from weed to cure everything  A lot of people  myself included  have made this mistake  You need to be actively trying to improve yourself daily  Look for a job  Work on your resume  Its not gonna fall into your lap because you decided to quit weed  Weed is a huge de motivator for me and I know stopping won't magically motivate me  Give it some more time  I had been sober for 5 months at one point and I was feeling the same way around the 1 2 month mark  I won't drink today Are you doing a stable scheduled and measured taper  It sounds kind of chaotic  I could see how that would just throw your whole system into a state  Hope you did it  It was my first day too and I did not drink with you  Not drinking with you today either     Do you know 'about' how many teaspoon 20 grams is  I still haven't gotten a scale  Im stuck on my taper  Holidays didnt help  Reading all these posts scare me since Im a long time user  9 years  ugh   Good for you    It took me a long time to be able to change my habit of daily drinking  and smoking     Although my badge only says 7 days  I was alcohol free for 29 31 days in December  I only slipped up around the holidays and only drank a few beers each time    However  my goal is lasting sobriety so there's still work to be done    Let me know if I can help in any way  For me  it's not the big ticket items  It's being able to spend here and there on hobbies and eating out without experiencing any of the anxiety and remorse that I experienced before because I I had been terrible with money and spending so much on booze  Being able to spend  50 on something fun without cringing in the slightest is pretty amazing     A sexually abusive relationship     An undiagnosed anxiety disorder     How poorly I was balancing my life because of the two He's saying he has quit and he wants knows he has to defeat it  I'm just wondering what steps I can take to push him in the right direction  Surely people who have quit also receive support from other sources and not just from their will power alone   Yay  My star finally turned 4    Today  I will add another day of not drinking   I'd happily use it once or twice a week  But I know I'd get into a mind set where I was just trying to get through the shitty non kratom days  It's so not worth it  I will not drink today  Sounds almost like she's on extracts   that for sure is not good  I would just ask her nicely without attacking  us addicts can be very defensive  I love this  A few years ago  I decided to stop using the phrase  "I'm busy" as an excuse for why I couldn't wouldn't do something  This post helps to further articulate my opinions on how we spend our time and why   No drinking for me today either   I've got too much to look forward to     Good job  and great advice I bought myself a few little gifts to mark one month of sobriety   a new fountain pen and some gorgeous inks   Calligraphy is the reason I gave up smoking a year ago  it's difficult to smoke and write at the same time   and now that I've stopped drinking I am far more focused and less shaky  so my writing has improved loads   I also find that calligraphy allows me to clear my mind  and it's a great way to avoid the creeping boredom in the evenings that usually led me to the bottle   Plus  it's super satisfying  I wouldn't see any reason to force yourself up after eight hours  I naturally sleep a lot more in the long nights of winter  Do you feel groggy from too much sleep or does it feel like the right amount for you  Are you in a wintery area  It may be to much medicine and your body still adjusting to being without buds  Stay strong and talk to your doctor's again  Suicidal homicidal thoughts are side effects of ssri type meds  I will not drink with you today  That was my New Year's Resolution actually   Doing okay so far  but I worry about what will happen once I'm back at work given my picking gets way worse when I'm stressed   I had never actually heard of liquid bandages  but they sound awesome and I'm going to pick some up ASAP   Good luck to you  You weren't alone   Awesome and all the best in the new year  I will not drink today  I'm right there with you  Message me if you wanna talk tips or anythinf  anytime  Good luck  let's make 2017 our bitch  Yeah  the hilarious part is how we all  at one point or another  thought we were hiding it or it wasn't  that  noticeable  I've come across things I haven't worn washed since I quit and every time I'm like "holy shit  I smelled like one of those giant cans you see outside businesses that are just overflowing with butts and trash"  I choose not to drink today   I had some of the worst nightmares I have ever had when I quit smoking  L I feel for you  know that this gets better soon x  Not drinking today  Hello all  I am sitting on 87 days and choose not to escape reality today  At the very least you can save some money by buying your booze in larger bottles and cut out the bar drinking    I feel you  I had to just plain throw out my tweezers because I couldn't take it anymore   I use a facial trimmer for my eyebrows   It's like a small electric razor   Cutting a hair isn't as efficient as plucking it  but if you really need to stop the tweezer addiction cold turkey it gets my recommendation  The trick for me was to learn to identify and not compare  I was the same way   until I realized the feelings they were talking about were the same as I was having  AA saved my life in large part because I understood I was not as different as my inner addict wanted me to think I was  Yeah MN winter sucks   It was a cold walk to the tavern last night and the snow wrecked my hair  I will not drink today     I made it through day 1  I will not drink today    Hey  you made it through your first two weeks that were also THE TWO HARDEST WEEKS OF THE YEAR to avoid drinking  with Christmas and NYE badgering you to grab a glass mug tumbler  Congrats  Keep going    I will not drink today  I will not drink with all of you today  have a great one  With you   Day 2  I was so depressed in the midst of drinking that I just didn't care if I lived or died  Today  so early in my recovery  I already feel so different  I actually feel the fog clearing  and my body healing  Yes  it's hard  But our bodies want to heal  and are amazing at doing it pretty darn quickly  Now I care very much about my life and health  my family and friends  and I care about you  It will happen for you too  You've taken the first step  you see  You are NOT gone  You are here  among friends  Fight hard  You can do it  You CAN  His post was removed  your comments remain  You seem to have some reading comprehension problems today  Thank you so much  Im going to do this right now  I definitely feel you about bandaids   I pick at my fingers till they bleed  and that's when I feel compelled to put a bandaid on   It works to heal the area but as soon as it's off and I feel that dry flakiness again  I just pick at it again    it's a horrible cycle   To try to help myself  I've used moisturizer whenever my hands felt dry  hoping it'd smooth over all the problem areas and reduce the compulsion   I've tried foul tasting nail polish too  because I often pick with my teeth   Recently my newest tactic has been trying to fidget with something else once I catch myself having the urge  because for me it's largely a nervous habit   These things haven't cured me completely  but I think it helps little by little   It's just a matter of remembering to do it before you do too much damage to your fingers  which is the hardest part by far  Yup  including one from myself a few weeks ago    i have really gotten into skincare  so I splurge on products or services  when i was drinking i could barely look in the mirror  After 5 weeks i find my skin is looking better and I am sure the extra attention is helping a lot   That shit was ridiculous    Sugar and heroin pills dissolve the same  didn't you know   I'm just making up this thing called solubility of course  The fact that I spent years in an actual fucking laboratory means nothing  I just need to go get a spoonful of sugar because that's definitive proof of his claims      And you've wasted all your drugs all these years  WHY AREN'T YOU HEATING THEM UP    Lolol  I don't know if you've ever even seen oxy tbh       And none of us are addicts or have any idea what we're talking about    Why the FUCK would someone pretend to be an addict and would y'all 2 deal with modding the other sub  which can be an absolute zoo   I don't mean that in a bad way  but it's a lot of work  just for shits and giggles  Like    Are you fucking kidding me   This  Having one drink has zero appeal to me  In fact  it sounds awful because it means that I'd have to stop myself after one  Zero is so much easier than one  Well done my friend  well done indeed  The valium will keep you alive if you have enough of it and don't drink while you're taking it  that can kill you    The good thing about valium is it has a long half life so it's easier to get off of it because it's somewhat self tapering   I'm not sure what the daily dosage would be to keep someone at your level from having alcohol withdrawal seizures though  I feel you   My dad especially likes to hound me for my finger picking   One time he got mad at me for doing it at a goddamn  restaurant  and it hurt me so much it was hard not to cry in front of the waitress   It's so exhausting trying to explain why I can't just "stop " Not drinking today   Checking in Most of the time I would say I'm groggy and takes me a while to wake up  But sometimes it's not always like that  I don't know  I'm so up and down mood wise  I can't seem to level out   It has been unseasonably warm where I am at  I live off the coast of the southern states in the us  It's been 60 70s  When normally it's in the 40s or cooler   You said you'd be accepting sign ups for the next 14 days and I commented yesterday  day 1  and have been p free for exactly one day      Maybe I said it wrong  please sign me up  Dayum Smokey     Even I'm not that salty this morning  Well played  I didn't see the January one in here    been clean one day already  so please sign me up  I won't drink with you today  Like with all things in my life  when I go to meetings I try to go with an open heart and absorb what speaks to me  With a respectful smile  I set aside what doesn't  That includes a lot of the capital G god references  This is my part of my spiritual path and practice  to make use of what cultivates my empathy and compassion  and set aside with a benign respect what doesn't   But after six months  it's funny how my perspective on some of these outdated Big Book passages have changed  Any West World fans out here  I can see now there are some blind spots in me just like the WW hosts  After some programming updates  I'm beginning to notice doors and clues where I didn't see them before  and some of the stuff I'd set aside earlier is beginning to speak to me even though I'm coming at it from a different perspective  I think setting things aside with benign respect rather than cultivating resentment towards them has helped me see this  Yay I got a full house    Wait  this isn't poker is it  I lose again   Great idea   There really are so many advantages to sobriety beyond the obvious ones   I will not drink with you today   some nice upgrades to my roadbike  and some really good meals  well done for those 9 days  you are doing great  Your are 100  correct regards loving yourself and this is definitely something I need to learn as I don't even like myself  Im going to read both of these books  Im so grateful for everyones help  I never expected even one reply so it really is so kind   Yep you're bang on  Let's do this together  Keep fighting the good fight    Sorry for your loss  You could try  "The Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions"  https   www amazon com Twelve Steps Traditions Alcoholics dp 0916856011  and  "Living Sober"  https   www amazon com Living Sober AA Services dp B0048C7TFA    they both helped me a lot and were written 15 and 30 years after the "Big Book" Alcoholics Anonymous   But the one book  that is not published by AA  which told me the most about AA and really helped me come to terms with practicing the 12 Steps as an Atheist is the book  "Not God"  https   www amazon com Not God Alcoholics Ernest Kurtz dp 0894860658  by Ernie Kurtz I'm not drinking today here in the U K      Classes begin again tomorrow and if I want to graduate   I have to not be a drunk fuck      Dont forget the over 37  years Fash and I got together with first hand daily experience  What does that mean  And we are lying cause it so cool to be Junkies these days  You know with friends dying weekly cause of fent and doctors being pressured to cut scrips  This idiots a Danger with this bad information he is mouthing off on  Hes watched Trainspotting and tried to shoot pharms a bit and hes the expert  Yet in the other sub a dozen users told him he was wrong  But hes not gonna let the facts get in the way of an arguement  Then theres the deleting of replies cause I called him on one them  It upset him enough to PM me last time so I wont bring it up again  And you watch S he will stick his nose in this thread even though he is not welcome  You are about the tenth person whos come forward to complain about him  Yet Fash and I are the problem  Fuck Him  And see Im not exposing him  Yet he calls me out earlier  Coward  Hello   I knew from growing up I had a predisposition towards addiction if I wanted one  I was 26 before I started drinking regularly  I already had an established life  hobbies  circle of friends who I knew and didn't care if I drank or not   A lot of people I've met on my journey have drank since their childhood and all events in their life have revolved around it to the point where there are no friends who don't excessively drink  No hobbies that don't revolve around sitting at a bar  I've even heard people say "I don't know who I am without alcohol "  I've also heard several times that people will judge you on your consumption based on their judgements of themselves  If you're abstaining then they might feel guilty  But that's them  not you  There are events I've decided not to attend because I didn't want some acquaintances to feel like they had to alter their behaviors around me  It's probably not a situation I need to place myself in anyways   Last point would be euphoric recall  If you are to see your drug of choice you might be tempted based on the possible rewiring of your brain  Not everyone has this of course  but it is something to be aware of  In testing they placed triggers in front of various people and addicts brains lit up when their drug of choice was shown   I definitely relate that I do not want to be ruled by this and give up everything I enjoyed in the past   things I enjoyed before I fell deep into my addiction  That said  I'd be very careful with where and whom you place your time with until you have a strong handle on what made you want to stop in the first place  Sign me up please        I love this last paragraph  Well said  Oddly enough  Kava Kava tea has proven effective for anxiety for some people  It has a GABA producing alkaloid in it that can provide fast anxiety relief  If you are taking any benzodiazepine based anxiety meds  like Xanax  Klonipin  etc  I would read into the effects of ingesting Kava in tandem with those before taking any   The leaves community will always have your back as well   There's a program you can download called Cold Turkey  You schedule in your study time and you are unable to access social media sites during those times  im in  please add me to the list Not going to drink today  But I will think about all of the stuff that deciding to drink has cost me over the years   I'm gonna stand over there and watch you tear assholes  A rare Smokey day indeed  Honestly  once you realise you don't need cigarettes any more and you're free of them  that was an incredible feeling  I'm so glad you've escaped them too  Don't rush to drop the nicotine levels in your juice  Take it easy and you'll get there  trust me  Now I treat my vaporiser like a glass of fine wine  I usually use it for a short while in the evenings when I'm unwinding  I don't bring it out with me  At one point I was worried I was more addicted to vaping because I would bring it everywhere  but you generally go through that stage when you drop the nicotine and you vape more in reaction  It does level out in time  Now that I know there's no nicotine in my juice I'm just not that fussed about it any more  It's just a treat for myself at the end of a long day   Day 2 for me as well  Woke up with a huge hangover yesterday after going out on NYE  I have to do better this year  The stakes are much higher in 2017  Child on the way  new job  new house   Well  good luck and see you again in about six months   How do you climb a staircase  one step at a time  Love this  It applies to so many things other than drinking  Thanks for posting  It happens to everyone  When I drank after a few months off  nothing terrible happened  but like you  I also woke up with a cloudy the next day and realized how much I missed the feeling of waking up with clarity and energy  I also noticed when my friends were throwing away half finished drinks  which was a huge  bright  glowing red flag reminder to myself that I have a problem with alcohol    I'm glad you realized that drinking isn't for you  and that nothing terrible or embarrassing happened  I'll gladly not drink with you today  Many people report quitting greatly improves mental health and makes you more able to deal with hardships  Good luck and stay strong  Focus on getting off the alcohol  After that is under control  you can re evaluate the other substances issues in your life   I will not drink with you today     I still feel really groggy some days       Still better than being super hungover   There isn't one close to me honestly  Where are you from  In the U K  It doesn't seem very popular therefore not very wide spread    I'm just gonna see how I go this week  Hopefully it's mostly mental  I need to get my anxiety disorder in check too as that's what makes me want to drink so I can just let go and chill   I will not drink today  no matter what happens  Thanks for the idea  Here here  I'm desperate to go to the pub today after having a shit time with my ex girlfriend  who  no suprises I lost due to drinking   But i'm hanging in there  just going for a walk instead   Day 2  I also find a shotgun clears my sinuses right up  Hobbies  Picked crocheting back up  Made a couple of nice throws and covers  Does tea drinking count  Books  Tons of books  both paper and audio  Amazing what a better attention span does for the enjoyment of them     Bought  Really small things in general  The biggest advantage is that when unexpected expenses arise   it isn't as devastating   Glad to hear things are going well      There are a few ways to track your progress  An excell spreadsheet is a good way too tally on what days you slip up then this can give you averages per month for you to work on  The badge counter is a bit primative but each to their own   Great  I will join your January 2 "party" and not drink with you and your daughter today  good on you  the good news is that associations like that fade relatively quickly  id be very surprised if they survive a 30 day streak I will not drink today   Lots to get done before back to work tomorrow   Oh  this is really useful  I'll check them out  thanks  after you get done with the "safe withdrawal"   which we all hope you do   Staying sober   is  going to be 100   mental  Thanks   I'm thinking I'll be there later this spring so I'll have to check some out    You never do  I originally quit because it was making me anxious   and I was using it to hide from my problems thinking "I'll just go back to it when I find nicer smoking buddies " It's been nearly a year and a half    Gotta get over the taste though   I will not drink today   When I was 8 but didn't start looking at Internet porn until like 16 or 17  When I was 26  that was 4 years ago  I decided to do something about the habit but took me another two years so 28 until I started to see porn and masterbation as two different things  These forums have come along way since I first started seeking out information  like 6 years ago you wouldn't have found information on these problems like there is today  Be on antidepressants whilst sober   Being on them whilst unsober doesn't target any potential self medicating   I will not drink today   Maybe I'm alone here  but I still smoke pot  I don't smoke everyday or even all day  Normally just a puff or two at night  My anxiety is off the charts and I don't take perception meds  Drinking was my problem  I would never  ever go to work stoned  but I've gone to work drunk so many times   You're not unique  I've seen GAD disappear in many  many lives after a brain gut normalizes  Seems to take between 1 3yrs  Jeej checking in  Happy new year everybody  For myself it has worked out pretty well  My close friends just accept I don't drink anymore and the ones who still drink like a pirate every second they get I just don't have out with  Nothing makes you feel like you made the right choice like being sober around a bunch of drunks  Even at family gatherings after you see someone on your third drink you start to think to yourself "oh wow  this is what I was like the whole time " I support my friends who no longer drink and I find other things to do with the ones that still do  Meet your friends who still booze for lunch or day time activities and then plan other fun things with the ones who don't drink  I don't judge or get involved  Everyone is on their own path  Work on making yours more positive and everything will level out accordingly Do you want to quit drinking  We can help with that  but only if that's what you want  not a fan tbh  the problem with a "keeping score" model like this is that it doesnt really track progress either  it just remembers stuff  also  once the numbers get somewhat high  it starts moving at a snails pace  with a shit ton of work required to even marginally improve the average or such figures    not saying the badges are perfect  but  i like them  if you can learn to not catastrophise a reset  they can be a great tool   That might have been a better option I am again inspired today by something someone's posted  Keep it coming y'all  I've been trying to write my relapse story to post later but every time I try to edit it  it gets longer    Oh my goodness  thank you  I won't  We'll keep fighting the good fight together   Yes  thankfully I always keep tea at work   I normally drink it more than coffee   but I just can't seem to wake up this morning   Something about how "I'm not even supposed to be here today "  haha Yay the holidays are over  Not drinking today  Congratulations  Well done and thanks for the inspiration  Happy New Year of freedom  Almost 39 days   I know that feeling of not caring  I suffered from it when I was 100  NEET   Try reading this  https   www reddit com r StopGaming comments 5kt3pt why games are bad for you what i learned from the    It might explain why you don't care anymore  Then just try a 90 day no gaming and no porn detox  Why no porn  A lot of the time we addicts switch from one destructive activity to another  Playing countless hours of video games and watching lots of porn look very similar   just you in you room staring at a screen and getting ridiculous amounts of stimulation from it   On a chemical level  your brain gets even more stimulation and pleasure from porn than gaming  https   www youtube com watch v 7oFVOJf0TzY   so don't switch from beer to vodka   I'm not saying you need to reinvent you life  start new hobbies activities  because that might seem scary and might stop your currently lazy brain from starting  Trust me I was there  Just detox  Just don't do those two things  Do whatever you want for those 90 days except those two things  stare at the sealing for all i care  maybe try avoiding drugs and large amounts of alcohol    but I'll leave that responsibility to you   Just make a pact with yourself not to do those two things  and no substitutes either   No Twitch YouTube Gaming channels  Instagram for half naked chicks   ecc   See for yourself if after a week or two of 'not doing' you'll get the desire to do something that is actually productive  But for the moment  just don't do those two things I did exactly this once  My god  worst decision I've ever made  For one day I was all 'I'm going to get control  find a better job  get where I want to be'   cue 6 months of unemployment on welfare  I'll never go back there again  Well done for getting out  I salute you   Thanks for sharing your story with me  You're right about the fact that it only gets worse  I think alcohol is so deceptive in that for some people there is never that car crash moment of realisation  Alcohol sneaks up on you so slowly that you can't recognise how much you've changed and are damaging yourself until it's too late     I'll bet that your drinking has a lot more to do with your mental health than you think it does   I think I've been coming to this conclusion today and for a while now  I've been convinced that depression is the sole reason for my despondence  and that it's something I only need to live with and survive through  But actually  I think my alcohol has a huge part in my depression  You'e right about not being honest with my therapist  I haven't come clean to them about how much I drink or the frequency of it   I think I'm going to try and do this alone for now  I have a huge support group of friends and family  my mum just called me as I've told her about all this and how helpful you've all been  and she's all for keeping tabs on me and is amazing at advice  Fortunately she's a mental health manager so she's very knowledgable about all of this   Again  thank you for sharing this with me and for giving me a little bit more confidence in myself    Honestly  reading all of these comments has made me feel just a little more confident about a future without booze    Thank you so much  Your approach and mindset are so refreshing and free of shame  It's an amazing perspective  one I am insanely jealous of  You just gave me my second big goal of 2017  Thanks for sharing  Ahh to dart between discussing German foreign policy and ladies knickers  Only on CA  Goodness  I needed this  Thanks for sharing  Not drinking with you today  I will not drink today  Woohoooooo  The Onion says it's the land of 10 000 retards  Just keep it up  Best iv felt in a long time     That I have no idea what to do with my life    Ruined my best friend ship I have ever had and   probably will never get that back  we were friends for 16 years  fuck love triangles of confusion    zero social life since   last event  hermit life has taken hold  weed makes this life tolerable   Have been smoking for 8  years  last year took a few weeks off here and there  this year it's done son  have basically hit rock bottom in my mind  which is good cause I actually feel like I can do it  the other times their was always a part of me that didn't want to quit  now theirs no part of me that wants to smoke    I would like that  thank you  I am going to stay on here  between reading The naked Mind someone kindly pointed me to a free download   My brother is a great guy but has never struggling with the issues I have  drinking especially is not something he has ever bothered about  so I know it will be hard for him to understand how its not just a case of "stopping"  And I like him to think Im strong and coping with life  Even though I am not at all  If you struggle to quit cold turkey  I'd say buy a vaporizer  5g a day is outrageous using any method other than joints   A long time ago   before I knew about reddit    I used to manage some streaks like 30 or 60 days and then relapse   I never felt I was making the change I wanted  the reason    my lifestyle  if you are reaching streaks of 30 days without a new way of life   your streak will mean nothing    you will binge again    in my case meditation has been part of my daily life   thats the main reason of my streak    I had like a 10 year porn addiction  in 2013 I got the right info to make a change   but it was until october 2013 that I could start my current streak  before 2013 I tried and failed many times   I don't count that time because my lifestyle didn't provide a solid foundation to make recovery a reality    so  in my opinion it depends on what you are doing for your recovery Day 2  feeling positive and supported by this sub  I will not drink with you all today  I know  this model just helps us remind the days we succeeded  Luckily you are only 24 and have plenty of time to turn your life around  If that is what you want  Not today  Not today  Not today   Agreed   OP   THIS is officially what alcoholism looks like   I love my nomo counter     It was definitely a huge driver in my sobriety  The thought of resetting my badge here and resetting my nomo counter always gives me intense anxiety and that extra incentive to put that drink down  And all the money    all the money  Instead of that massive oversized 90 dollar bottle of bullet  I can instead but three pairs of 30 dollar pants   Well  that is totally different  but since majority of people here keep score  then why forget the winning factor  I quit twice   the first time I mega dosed Imodium and the second time I only took three or four tablets every other day  sometimes every third day  That worked a lot better  and I was able to taper down with no problems  I mainly took it to stop the vomiting and shaking  I'd say you can take a lot less than you think you need  Even if it did extend my withdrawal  it was necessary for me at the time  I prob took it for a 2 week period or maybe 1 5  Don't let it overwhelm you  You are still young and in time this will pass and just be a bad memory  Hire a lawyer and try to get the best deal you can  then buckle down work and get through your punishment  hopefully probation and community service  then get on with your life and use this lesson to help you to never drink and drive again  I got lucky when I was a few years older than you and ran my truck off the road and through a fence when I was just a year or two off probation for a DWI  I drove drunk the whole time I was on probation and just got "lucky"  Twice I got pulled over and the police let me go  I could have easily died in that accident  A 2x4 was sticking through the windshield into the passenger seat of my truck  If someone had been riding with me they would have died  Had I gotten another DWI before this it would have motivated me to stop this dangerous behavior prior to this accident  Luckily  nobody died and I got off with a public intoxication ticket as they could not prove I was driving the truck because I took off walking after the accident and only remember waking up while walking down a dirt road  While there have been a few occasions  I pretty much quit driving while drunk after this    I am just trying to put your situation into the best light for you  If you take it as an opportunity to learn a lesson and adjust your behavior  it could have been the best thing to happen to you  If you were driving that fast at a 1 8 you could easily have killed yourself  everyone in your car  and other innocent people on the road as well as causing some PTSD to the first responders    If you need to stop drinking completely to stop this behavior  then please do so  I am sure this sub can give you lots of advice and resources for getting help if needed  I am not one to tell you how to do that  just wanted to let you know that you are not alone and your life is not over  Did you not look at porn between the ages of 8 and 16 or were you implying that you were looking at other forms of pornographic media other than what was available on the internet  Something something alone and wanting more  While having moar   Praying I wont drink today  Good luck everyone  What a great day to start your freedom from the grips of alcohol  I won't drink with you today   Well back to day 1  I'll go through periods of LOTS of picking and then periods when I'm not picking  Seemingly not by any willpower of my own  I'm just    not thinking about it  But then if I start thinking about how I'm doing so well with not picking  I'll find myself picking again because I've brought it back to my attention  It's hard to put a number on the days because  when I'm doing well  I'm not counting the days    One of my resolutions for the new year is mood regulation all around  that seems to help my picking the most  It was nice to quit drinking when I did because this year the holidays didn't put me in too bad of a hole  I feel like I spent my booze money on gifts  which is a great feeling  I also felt like I could buy myself things I needed like new skates and new snow boots   As far as hobbies  I've taken up crochet since I stopped drinking and it's been really great  It gives me something other than sipping on a drink to do when just hanging out with friends or watching tv  I can't drink and crochet at the same time  I just gave a friend the scarf I made for him for Christmas and he was so excited about it  Such a good feeling  TMI   I will not drink today  All of us alcoholics have done things we are not proud of   You can't change what happened   You can only make changes going forward    Do you have a plan   Rehab  Therapy  AA   Also  might I suggest you post on  r stopdrinking    It is a much more active sub   I will not drink today I can see how that would help  My whole life I have struggled with one addiction after the other  and always believed it to be part of my personality  Managed to quit drugs cocaine ecstasy  and cigarettes when i had my first child but replaced with the more acceptable drug alcohol and this is the hardest fight yet  Appreciate the reply and best wishes to you too  My day 2 too  Stick with it and stay connected to this sub  We can do this   I don't consider that a relapse  A relapse is when you fall back into old habits and erase whatever progress you made  You made a mistake and learned from it  Good for you for quitting ciggies too  That truly is a disgusting habit with no benefits whatsoever  Keep on truckin u brookeslegit   NO  The earlier the better  Porn has no benefits so why not quit  I will not drink today  This 2017 wagon is getting crowded   Lemme on  Day 17 cold turkey off of 40 to 60 g day  Sleep very fitfully  wake up with waves of anxiety  I've had this Christmas break off and I'm going back to work tomorrow  and I'm completely terrified  Sweating like crazy at night  wake up every hour little less  have a zero motivation  I'm really worried about work  I have so many things that I've left unfinished  that demand my immediate attention when I get back tomorrow  Really   After all my drivel and bullshit  THAT'S where CA draws the line    I have to poop too  Do you have the kids today  If not  why not try making some tea and hanging out on the couch with this sub for a couple hours  When I couldn't do anything else  I read people's stories here and it sparked some motivation for me  Hope to see you around     You have found a good place to go to  here  You'll be ok  Don't let your thoughts consume you  Your alive  I won't drink with you today   Yes  it is different for everyone   I just wanted to convey  that even if relapse  the progress we made doesn't gets lost  That time is still accounted for  we don't start from zero  we continue from there  And that is what I think this model will convey  Way to go  it's good to know that all the things I am missing right now  are possible by quitting  Thank you for sharing  Sorry but I don't fully understand what you meant  You mean that alcohol intake could be a reason for my GAD  I had similar thing earlier in 2016  ending a stint of abstinence with a single beer   that's all it takes  The important things    recognizing it's only a 'battle' lost  and you are able to make clear self observations to learn from as you move forward  Good luck  look  i dont think youre ready to be a cautionary tale just yet  i mean youre young  youre free  you have a fucking degree to work with  i mean  just go reset your badge and go tackle day 1   I think the best reminder or coping mechanism for that is how you felt the morning after the day you relapsesd   The guilt and the unravelling of all the progress you had made    Tell yourself that that one drink won't even feel good  perhaps not even taste good  because the moment it touches your lips you reset  You've gone way back to the beginning and you have to endure those awful first days all over again    Stop that one drink from happening and you don't have to suffer day 1   groundhog day   Good luck   I've got to start getting my shit together and put away my Xmas shit  clean out the fridge  wash the kitchen floor  etc  Then I have to get some actual paid work done because I am broke AF  I didn't sleep last night   but only had very minor WDs from drinking for ONE measly day  I have 8 benzos left but gotta save them in case I go off the wagon before the 15th  blessed script renewal day     grumble grumble  Great post  Thank you  Thank you alot  I already started going out more the past days  but another reason which is probably the reason why I wrote this post is that I lost the feeling of self worth  On top of all these problems I struggle with a girl which ultimately got me on an all time low    I will take your advice to heart  but I am currently really fucked up in my head because of all these mixed moods  I wonder if those of us who try so hard to be seen to be strong   the people who try to cope with too much   tend to be more likely to get a bit crushed by the weight of things and end up having issues with alcohol and other substances   But you ARE strong  you've reached out  you're raising kids on your own  you're working  you're doing a LOT to keep it together  and there's no shame in getting help for your sake and for the sake of your family   I do find that people are often far more understanding and forgiving than I expect them to be   coming clean to by business partner was nerve wracking  but I've had nothing but support and encouragement from him  even though he hasn't been through this kind of struggle and doesn't really understand the idea of not being able to 'just stop'    Either way  you're here  and so are we   We've got your back  so if you need to be sad  or angry  or frustrated  or confused or happy  or  if you want to be pointed in the direction of good resources  you have come to the right place  Makes sense to me brother  I'm scared to death to sleep most of the time  because I wake up  in inexplainable land     20grams a day   I'm not even sure how much that is  so I could of taken 6 x that a day    Does anyone know about how much fits into a "00" Capsule with the fine flour powder     No I haven't quit yet and haven't started a taper yet  I'm trying figure out Just how I'm going to do this exactly  If I do   I quit a couple times before   I'm still piecing together events that has happened in the past 2 years and also before that when I quit  I'm not jumping into Withdrawal without of plan  that's for sure   Been there and it was hell    i know its a sin to put ketchup on it but i like it A sobering reminder that today is not promised and that I will not pollute my body with toxins   Thanks for sharing   Control the things you can  get them into meetings for kids with alcoholic parents  therapy  and Amazon Prime books their way that are relevant   Continue to talk about it with them and your dad   One of the most difficult things for those with addicted loved ones to deal with is the silence or denial surrounding the existence of the addiction   Every time your father denies he has a problem  he is telling them their reality isn't what it really is   That causes serious emotional damage   If you talk about the addiction with them  you will continue to validate their daily reality  which will be so empowering to them   This validation is one of the reasons that Al Anon is such an amazing resource   I'm hoping you would have shared if they are in physical danger   Either way  that comes first   I wouldn't hesitate to call the police if you have any reason to believe he is driving under the influence  advise them to do the same   or please call the Department of Human Services if your siblings are directly in danger   The emotional well being of children is not to be taken lightly    Yeah  it's so fucking cool to be a junkie  That's some HS bullshit lol  no one would voluntarily brag about things like shitting on the floor because they're trying not to puke whilst running to the washroom  Why   It's not exactly fun or glamorous      And I agree  I think people SEE the whole lighter and spoon thing in movies and make assumptions    Hell  I certainly did way back in the day  I remember the first time I ever shot up and I was like "uhhh aren't you supposed to heat it up or something " but my friends were like    nope   In retrospect  they were stupid as fuck and even they knew better  ffs   Hey  Fuck you too  man  Hahaha  I feel you  So many average idiots who do nothing more but sleep  eat and shit  And moreover they are comfortable living the rest of their pathetic lives that way   First of all  you are depressed  Here is a book that helped me and will help you if you use it  "The Depression Cure" by Dr  Steve Ilardi   I have very same thoughts from time to time  But you know what  You and I can always choose to just stop get back to gaming and forget everything  Hell  I would love to go back to WoW and CSGO  But that's selling yourself short   I'm not "gifted" nor "talented" in some special way  But I believe that average Joe like you and I can achieve things beyond average  Skillpower over Willpower  That's what I tell myself  Doing small things but doing them consistently is a way to go    Media feeds us bullshit about "successful" and "genius" people  90  of that is absolute horseshit  And you have a right to be mad  There are people who seem to be having it all  But fuck them  Big "fuck you" to all of them and others  Because they are lying pieces of shit  Everyone struggles   I have only one life and you  I suppose  too  So why bother about someone else's expectations  Progress as much as you can and forget about everyone else  You are changing something and that's all that matters  When I was 13 I actually hit puberty and was looking at the odd magazine here and there  wasn't till I was 16 that we got a computer with Internet at home  mind you this was like 1999 or 2000 ish  about 16 24 I wouldn't say I had an excessive use problem it was as I got older o was using it to escape not just cause I was horny  Hey  if you like it   go for it  Thank you   Thank you  I will not drink today  I am so with you  girl  I'm moving in 11 days and my  1 goal   find some friends  I'm not sure if they will necessarily be "sober friends" but they will for sure be friends where our  1 connection isn't booze  All my current friends  with the exception of one running buddy and one work friend  are from bars  karaoke   so they are mostly Facebook friends at this juncture  Holding a grudge  Whatever  As long as this person isn't sitting alone with another person as a "counselor" then everything is OK   Had a great day 1 yesterday  Today will be as good if not better  Not gonna say I won't take it   P  Wait  I thought it was a pissing contest    grabs mop and bucket  Thanks Lem  I mean really with this shit though Wait a second an organ donor on an alcoholism subreddit    You may wanna rethink something there    Lol  I know what you mean  Most of the world is off today  Or so it seems    You are sooo close to turning a corner man  This whole process can grate at your resolve to quit  It seems unending at times  I promise you that you will be okay tomorrow  may not be how you want to feel   yet  but you can do it   Maybe getting involved back into work is what you need right now  The diversion and the "go" requirement may push you through  I know when I got to the point you are  just over it and praying it would end  it was 2 days away and boy was I thankful  on my knees thanking whoever   You are almost there brother  You have come so far  Please don't pysch yourself out  You have warriored through don't turn around now  You can get it done  Proud of you   Not exactly uncommon in my life in general  tbh     Right here with you   I never had much passion for anything  I would switch from game to game looking for a high and an escape  I am on day 7 right now and even in the first few days I have been experiencing so many emotions  Anger  fear  hope  excitement   The funny thing is that I prefer even the negative emotions to the emptiness that I have experienced for so long  At least I am feeling something  It gives me strength to resist the cravings  They ebb and flow like the tides but each day has been a little better  I am looking forward to day 14    30     90     180     360    I know what it's like to experience suicidal thoughts  Just random ideas that popped into my head  One of the scariest symptoms of addiction is the powerlessness that we have  If you can accept that  it's easier to understand that the urges and ideas we have are our brain playing tricks on us  I hope this helps somehow   I will not drink today Doing it right  I asked him if you heat a pill and it melts all the shit do you want to shoot that  Thats a  no  The drug is soluble and the binders not  So you are shooting polymers and fillers when you heat  And thats OK  Huh Really  Glad I can help  Think about it like this  If you have food poisoning  your body makes you feel bad  'gush from both ends'  and stay away from food for a while  We all have been poisoning our brains for a long period of time  and now we need to stay away for a while    Good luck  And alcoholics    What is a full house of dicks      No drinks today  Welcome   I was just talking with a friend of mine   I honestly stayed away from sobriety for a long time because  I thought I had to be physically dependent on alcohol to have a problem   I came to realize that I could simultaneously have a problem with alcohol and not be alcohol dependent   I've found great support in the rooms of AA where I found lots of people just like me   I've also found great insight here at SD    When I think about what you wrote  I remember that my story is pretty much similar  Of course I always had anxiety problems  but I started drinking when I was in good state   and from the very start I couldn't moderate  Maybe I was just born this way too  Thank you for your words  Ounces  Lol  Thank you for sharing this  Don't donate the liver   I don't know how it works  I used to smoke 14g a week  100  at 8 12 joints a day  Sober now but still cough up black shit daily   Would love to know how he can have a smoke in the morning and quit during the day   I could NEVER do that  i have to smoke before bed then quit in the morning  no way could i go through the day without smoking again if i smoked on a morning   I'm with you  too  Day 1 and done   You're 25 years old and talking like your life is over  and it's too late for you   Do you know how strange that sounds to a 51 year old like me     Think for a minute about yourself as a 51 year old man   Imagine yourself with almost 10000 days on your badge     Begin with the end in mind  https   www reddit com r pornfree comments 2wdkvj a concrete tip for staying away from porn begin    Its a Beautiful Morning here in Wisconsin  I will enjoy it by not drinking  Our marriage counselor said that with addiction  the longer you go  the less intense the urges are over time  but if you succumb to the urge  the intensity resets to very powerful  and neurocircuitry  wise  you're back to square one  and the urges are shot up to the same potent max they were before   This could explain lack of motivation  vs  The numbers restarting   It's a cool idea though  but I think the less cpnsequences you have mentally for yourself for a relapse  the more likely you are to relapse   That's how it was for me with alcohol  I will not drink today  no matter what  Reading of another member's post on pancreatitis reminded me to stay vigilant   Poppy seeds will also help   A tea with 1kg should help you feel better   People like to say poppy seed tea is dangerous but in your case I wouldn't worry about that   Worse case scenario you will get high  Reading these posts  made me think  that maybe it was that "old self" is who we tried to escape   Just a theory or a BIG LIE     I started to say other things but  I haven't quit like I said and don't want to mess with anyone's mind but my own right now     That's one thing I don't want to deal with is other people's minds out there  In the Real  not here   I don't know if that makes sense to anyone either  I will not drink with you all today  I will not drink today  I will not drink today  Good luck  And try to find an alternate activity that gets you away from the usual routine  I'm even just trying sit in a different part of the house so I'm not staring at my smoking spot  This is exactly what I have been doing kids happy having a chill day playing Sims so I don't feel too guilty for not giving them all my attention  They have accepted that I dont feel well  told them it was flu   Im going to read some success stories too like you suggested  I dont want this feeling of being motivated and ready for change to stop  Well done for your own success  that must feel great  All that says is some vape juice contains diacetyl  Nowhere does it say anyone has actually gotten popcorn lung from vaping or that vaping puts you at risk for popcorn lung    Again  there isn't a single documented case of vape related popcorn lung     Again  cigarettes contains 750x the amount of diacetyl than any vape juice  and yet there aren't even any documented cases of popcorn lung from smoking either    Again  finding a juice company that still uses diacetyl is super rare     You should try actually reading the articles you link because now  you  are supporting my argument  Thanks    http   www snopes com vaping causes popcorn lung    http   tobaccoanalysis blogspot com 2015 12 new study finds that average diacetyl html m 1        Not drinking today   Just for today   Not thinking about tomorrow    Sign me up  Day off today and then it's back to work tomorrow  I will not drink today   What a great post   Thank you for sharing      I wanna finish my stash off so I have none left Yeah once self driving cars are roaming the streets I won't have anymore excuses  You might add r petioles for those who are in the group of people r leaves does not cover  Clothes to replace the ones that no longer fit  because I was no longer taking in a bazillion bloaty calories of beer  And then clothes to replace those  Me too  Whew  Made it through the weekend  I will not drink today   Lol  I'm vaguely reminded of the time my roommate several years ago was hell bent on shooting Xanax     Is it possible  Yes  But it's not water soluble and the fillers will fuck your veins to all hell if you don't know what you're doing     Y'all want endocarditis  embolisms  etc  Because I'm pretty sure shooting a bunch of fillers and random shit is a great way to increase the likelihood   Happy almost 1 year sober friend  Exactly 3 weeks for that beautiful chip  Keep up the work Get back on the wagon   We are here to help and encourage you   One day at a time    D10  v2  all's well  I will not drink today  Worked out  cooking breakfasts for the week  still have tons to do before going back to work tomorrow  Vacation has been awesome  Don't give up   This sounds like a suicide letter to me   If so  just know that these feelings will pass  and that you can succeed with this battle   Your life means something  even if you can't see it right now   Please get help if you're suicidal   You are not a bad person  because of the addiction   Your brain is programmed to feel the way you're feeling right now  and you CAN change that   You CAN recover   You CAN be happy and have a normal life   You CAN do this  Or is it exciting to think how much more you'll have this year to spend on other stuff  Thank you for this Need it today    I learned how to be quieter  I was an insufferable know it all when I drank  and sometimes still now   I have been learning to be quiet  listen to others  seek advice  gasp    and generally offer advice when asked rather than ubiquitously  My millennial tendency to think of myself as 'a special snowflake with unique opinions that I need to share with the world' is hard to combat some days  but I am learning slowly   I dont get on with any member of my family  smoking weed let me ig ore all shit  now im sober we havent spoke for ages and i'm leaving them all for good   Sounds like a bright start to the new year  Love it  Thanks  It's hard as fuck to do  but in my experience  every time I binged on porn  I sooner or later binged on League  The reward circuits are  connected in the brain  so I think it's a huge trigger  I can't give up masturbation though  I need release once a week at least  so the hard part for me will be to masturbate without porn  The speech is called "This is water " It's fantastic  I will not drink today   Thank you for the words of encouragement  I really needed to hear some Yep  your just getting too personal  Good luck with your poop  Are expecting a solid one or more liquid   Count me in   not drinking with you today  I had a friend die as a direct result of shooting pills and that creep has the nerve to say to me no one ever died from shooting pills  WTF   And the Endo Fash had twice and me once was what  More lies so we look cool  Godamn enough   Edit  Sorry I didnt have Endo  I cant remember the name right now  But I had a bleed in my lungs from shooting drugs  Even without heating I still had enough in my rig to cause a hospital stay of five days with oxygen and a Big Time warning from doc that next time a bleed starts it might not stop  And I will bleed out in my lungs  Basically drowning in my own blood  Nice eh  Cant you see now why we lie about this  Fucking Dumb Ass   But this is cool eh S   Fuck  This is one of the reasons my ex bf broke up with me  I was am trying to improve my eating habits and try new things with the help of a psychologist  but he thought I wasn't progressing fast enough  Other people don't fully understand what it's like to have this fear constantly and that I have developed a habit that is hard to let go of  The 4 and 9AM trips had good consistency  A frat house Never once in 13 years did i get brain fog  not once  Not once got tired or lazy  i do t u derstand how people do  it got me Up and about  got me to sleep so i wasnt groggy in the morning  i used to smoke 14g a week 8 12 joints a day for 13 years everyday not once breaking that  Now i quit cant sleep or eat for over a month and i dont want to do shit all ever  Brain fog after smoking to me just shows your brain aint developed enough to smoke to begin with  Well done bro  feels good doesn't it  I may be coming out of my flatline already as I felt an energy surge on waking up  rather rollercoaster like  I may have been dreaming last night but can't remember what  I felt at one point like I was going to O but it never happened and I fell back asleep again  I have a bit of a cold at the moment which seems to make my urges return  Awesome stuff on your streak  70 days tomorrow  As a fellow tall thin man  duly noted  wishing you a quick recovery  Yes I quit adderall over a year ago and it definitely didn't help with the anxiety although it did with the crippling fatigue  I'm glad it helped  Here's to 2017 being poison free  Here's the tough lesson I learned when living my own personal hell of being in love with a wonderful  loving man who also had the disease of addiction  and depression   there was is NOTHING I could do to influence his sobriety or his drinking   I gave all  I loved  I supported  I paid for therapy  I went to therapy with him  I bought him art supplies to work through his demons  I meditated twice daily with him  I went on middle of the night runs with him when he needed to get energy out  we went vegetarian  we went to the gym  we went on hikes  we got a pet  we read and read and read about it all   The thing is  NOTHING I did or didn't do stopped him from drinking or encouraged him to drinking   That chaos existed apart from me  I just kept making the mistake of thinking that if I lived close enough within the chaos  I could control it   I was wrong   So let me start here  with love  it sounds like he is a very sick man  who has wonderful qualities or you wouldn't be with him   You said you were worried that he might drink himself to death if you left  but it sounds like he has already been trying to do that a few times  if not on a pretty regular basis   You also said you wanted to give him a second chance  but it sounds like that maybe was the 3rd or 4th or 5th chance      So be easy on yourself about doing for him and bring there for him because it sounds like you've been doing that   My question to you is  Is it working   I gave mine at least 100 chances   At least   I kept telling myself  my therapist  my friends that I wasn't ready to walk away until I felt like I had done everything I could do for him  for us   The truth is  I finally was ready to walk away when I finally admitted that all the things I was doing   it wasn't working   Sure  he had ups  sure he had months of sobriety   But sum total  all that bending over backwards  worrying  helping  frantic searches in the middle of the night   it wasn't working   Mostly because it wasn't up to me to do anything   Of course I don't mean be kind and caring and supportive   I mean it wasn't up to me to figure out how he could control his chaos and addiction   That was for him and him alone to fix   The hardest thing for me to swallow was that my love wasn't going to fix him   As an recovering addict  congratulations  that's hard work   you already know that   So here is the advice I would give myself 3 years ago if I could   1   Make a list about what I want in life  what's important  what goals I want to accomplish  what's not getting done that might regret  2   Double check that list to make sure it is really important  3   Ask myself what is standing in the way or preventing that from getting done  4   Make a plan to overcome or remove that obstacle   Only you will know when you are ready to move away from his entirety   meaning his good and his bad   It's not easy whether you stay or go   I hope you are going to AA and Al Anon meetings in the meantime   They will remind you of the importance of taking care of yourself and how important it is to work a program   And when you decide it is time to go  that means it is time  so please don't guilt yourself into staying  You have me in tears here  but in a good way  It means the world honestly  I have no real friends as Ive managed to isolate myself completely  other than work friends who dont know the real me just the fake me that I am through the day  You are right  a hobby is exactly what I need  Ive always put off anything that has me away from the house for too long  even resenting the kids after school clubs as it cuts in to drinking time  but I need to be out of the house  especially on the days they are not here  well done to you for your acheivments and thank you for taking the time to reply to me   Look  if mice are given cocaine every time they press a button  they're going to press that button over and over repetitively  because it makes them feel really good   It's super normal to want to feel really good as frequent as possible   That is normal across all animals  including us   But take the mice off the cocaine and they recover   It just takes time   Us addicts have trained ourselves to become impatient to gratification  and that's normal for addicts  but if you can just buckle down and get some cognitive behavioral therapy and develope positive coping skills to get through the depression  anxiety  and cravings  I give you my word  it works if you stick with it   It is not easy  but it is not impossible or even very difficult if your mind is in the right spot and set on your goals   Keep your focus on ypur goals  and that will help you to push through it   But developing coping skills is necessary  and cognitive behavioral therapy helps you do that   YOU ARE  NOT  A FAILURE  YOU ARE  NOT  A BAD PERSON  THESE ARE LIES THE ADDICTION IS TELLING YOU  YOU HAVE NOT FAILED  I'm so sorry for all of the pain you're experiencing  It really can get better  I have had similar feelings of despair  I feel like I have lost am losing everything  and I am so afraid to lose everything  that I want to just make it stop  effectively ensuring that I lose everything   Drinking is the easiest way  oblivion   Then it makes  me feel worthless and increases my self loathing  It's just bad feelings begetting bad feelings begetting bad feelings  It reminds me of the Bright Eyes song  "Hit the Switch"    I'm thinking of quitting drinking again  I know I've said that a couple of times  And I'm always changing my mind  I guess I am  But there's this burn in my stomach  and there's this pain in my side  And when I kneel at the toilet and the morning's clean light pours in through the window  sometimes I pray I don't die  I'm a goddamn hypocrite    After 86 days without drinking and some therapy I can report that I am still depressed and have psychological emotional problems and messed up thinking  but  I feel WAY better  Part of it is just removing the depressant and no longer feeling the pain and discomfort that drinking heavily bring  If you feel really bad physically it's harder to keep it together mentally  Part of it is the sense of accomplishment  And then a big part of it  for me  is removing  well  reducing  the total obsession with drinking  I can actually do things and pay a little bit of attention without obsessing over when I'm going to drink again    Good luck  You're not a bad person  You are addicted to an addictive substance  It's hard to escape from alcohol  but you can do it and it'll be worth it  I am signing up  The exams start in February  so with all the studying and other recovery stuff that I do  no gaming should be easy  Thank you    how long did you have them for   It took me years to curb my addiction  this is my longest streak by far  once got 50 days last summer but nothing else close to this  Don't give up  one day you'll find a way how to control it  Good Luck  I'm not drinking for the next 24 hours  So  at least until 7 53 a m  on Tuesday  January 3  2017  Everyones brain reacts differently to different chemicals  You may be right though  I am 18 years old and started smoking daily around 12  I should probably note that the only brain fog i got was the morning after or hours after burning out  Picking up my 2 year chip tonight  probably best not to show up drunk  I won't drink today  Don't be too harsh on yourself bro  There's still much time left  Start today  its never too late  Become porn free  Now is the time  At the end of 2017  you will have gained a 1 year streak  You can still achieve anything you want  Be dedicated and focused on your goal  Yay not today bro  30 days tomorrow  I will not drink today  The first time I took an extended break  wasn't planning to quit  I did the math and realized my shitty job in no way would support my family  girlfriend was pregnant at the time   So I got my shit together and increased my income by roughly 100   Went back to smoking once I was comfortable in my new job and being a dad    This time around my life is in better shape  Since I stopped about 5 months ago  I've come to one major realization     There is absolutely JACK SHIT that I'm better at when I'm high  The only reason this illusion was created was that I was smoking so much that it was normal for me  So in the short term  I would be "better" at certain things if I had smoked recently  Once I stopped for over a week this illusion was shattered   I'm on day 8 and read your post and was like  that's me  I've been sleeping ridiculous amounts of time and I'm still exhausted  Feel lethargic  grumpy and miserable  Maybe it's our bodies getting back on an even keel  Good luck to you  I won't drink with you today   That's a good resolution  Mine is to do more productive things when I'm home alone  I noticed a couple weeks ago when I was wrapping gifts and making cards for my family and stuff that I didn't think about picking even once  I was occupied doing something that brought me joy when a lot of times  I'll do things that are nonproductive  like binge watching Netflix  and I end up just bored and anxious and inevitably wander into the bathroom to pick  The first handful of meetings I went to I was a mute   I was basically a houseplant   I didn't utter a single word   AND THAT IS OK   However  when I finally decided to open up and speak a little  I found that it made my nervousness disappear   Everyone in that room has is going through the same thing you are   They are there to help  not judge   Give it a chance    All good so far   Best of luck to all  I recommend you get the "Adult Blocker" chrome extension and make a habit of asking yourself why you visit any particular website  youtube video  or tv channel  Good luck    u greatmainewoods  https   www reddit com user greatmainewoods  on   r stopdrinking  https   www reddit com r stopdrinking    In reply to  Now I am relegated to a dull lifestyle    I have to disagree with you  I think you will find  like me  that life without alcohol is far more rewarding and exciting than life with alcohol  Alcohol makes things boring  when you are not drinking   It's not that those things are necessarily boring  Alcohol fucks with the reward center of your brain  It takes a while for you to get to the state where just doing things like hiking  cooking  a sunny day  board games  movies become as rewarding as alcohol  You may find that it's more rewarding to live life without alcohol  I did     Wow  Another comment to make me count my blessings  You give powerful advice of acceptance  which is definitely not something I have been practicing  In fact  I regularly engage in thinking that somehow acquits myself of personal responsibility for my situation as a way to avoid accepting it  This was a powerful comment  Congrats   Thanks for sharing your story with us  I'm starting this new year with enthusiasm and positivism  knowing that if I'm sober I can be focused on everything that's valuable for me and my family  So I won't drink with you today  where everything starts   I will not drink today    This is exciting  I never have been part of this before  Makes me smile and I needed that   Good luck to all   All good so far   Get the "Adult Blocker" chrome extension and make a habit of always question yourself why you are doing whatever you are doing  It sounds like you handled the situation well  Don't beat yourself up  When you  actually  only have one drink  that's not going to kill you  The issue is when one drink leads to 10 drinks   So you're good to forgive yourself and move on to the next day of 100  sobriety     Thanks for the support   The same happened to me on Christmas  must have been some kind of stomach bug  I know exactly what you mean about how it feels good that it wasn't due to booze  It sucks that your boyfriend asked you repeatedly  If it was someone close to me asking me again and again after I already told them I didn't drink  I would get furious at them  For me weekends were are hard because of all that "empty" time that is so easy to fill with drinking  In my moments of strength  or regret etc  I would brain storm a hobby or something to go out and do    Make a dinner our of all purple food means I have to shop and cook  Go to the mall with my best friend and see who can model the worst outfit  Find a fan website for my favorite book and post crazy theories  I dared myself to do one thing like this sober and then another and again until I didn't have any more empty space in my weekends   Man the first week was ok  sleep was fucked and no appetite  week 2 rage on the whole meaning of life set in  that stayed till 1 month mark  Get ready and be prepared  buy a punch bag  that shit is godly  "Move a muscle  change a thought " I have analyzed  ruminated  dug deep for the big W  Why  Why   and none of that helped me at all  What did and does was folding laundry  mending something  cleaning the drain  shoveling  The sentence you've quoted above is the most helpful thing I've ever heard  Thank you   I have ocd and pubic pulling trich but I find that I do this too yeah  i don't do that anymore   No problem     Walk tall friend  you ARE doing what so many of us were are so afraid of  THAT takes a huge pair and a total overwhelming desire to kick this plant  It's no small feet  Keep rocking it  Lol what he said that  Uhhh okay    And yeah  the last time I had an IV and they had to go for the femoral after blowing over a dozen spots was really fucking fun and not awkward at all  The pictures of the PICC line they had to give me one time because my veins are so fucked off    nah  I made that up  All photoshopped lies      Nevermind that more than one person from this sub has physically seen me in hospital    Ahaha   I posted in this sub on my third day of sobriety  I received several messages congratulating on my decision and many words of support and encouragement  Little did I know that those words would reverberate in my mind each time that I found myself in a moment of weakness  just knowing that there was a group of people out there fighting the same fight that I'm fighting today made all the difference    This was my best New Years to date and I have myself  my loving wife  and these kind strangers to thank for it  Happy to have you here  I will choose Life with you today   Still comfortably in bed  6am here on west coast  Insomnia I think from getting on subs still  Today third day on em  Havent even been able to do more than one day since moving back to city couple months ago  Still gotta taper from xanax  continue to smoke etc  someday i may return to program  For now tho  the big thing is    Anyone relate   40 70 a day when I make  100 130 is just too much  I am 25 and want to travel more  india this summer  and am getting no where w this habit  Lotsa days I just dont care though  just about working towards that moment of catharsis the needle provides and that erodes desire worry about the whole other section of life  Why have all these complex cares when getting through my day to just nod smoke and watch tv can satisfy  Hard often for me to answer that  to remember why when i first wanted to be a punk i dreamed of something other than work sedation repeat yet somehow  in a different form  here we are  Regardless  enough about me  grateful to have taken my sub this morning and save my wallet n veins just for today  Like a couple of weeks  I think all that unprocessed anxiety just needed to come out somewhere tbh   Thank you for the kind words    I'm definitely the type who will go from 1 drink to 10 drinks without realizing it  I'm young so I've been able to justify my behavior  but I'm also old enough now to realize it's abuse and not just being a "weekend warrior"   Oh snap   Projecting their own insecurities all the time  Literally introducing me to new people saying "Here's  u IrishOrganic  he doesn't drink"      smh Well first off  alcohol doesn't really cook off  Here's a link   http   www todayifoundout com index php 2011 11 alcohol doesnt really cook out of food in most cases   For the last 2 years I have dithered whether or not to eat anything cooked with alcohol  My current thinking FOR ME is it is OK if part of gourmet cooking  Notion is that it is part of the flavouring and not alcohol for drinking  This is a fiddly point that I am not happy with  And is just for me  Mileage may vary   edit  I should add that this is my current thinking  For near 2 years I banned intake of alcohol in any form into my body  This relaxation is because I love gourmet food  I hope I haven't chipped a hole in my armor  I intend to proceed VERY cautiously  I spent 150 bucks on LivePlan and actually wrote my business plan    I finished it yesterday  I will not drink today   I will not drink today  It snowed like hell in STC last night  I wasnt about to trek out  even to the corner bar    Hope you made it back alright and didnt passout in a snowbank and get frostbite haha   "You"  your consciousness  are separate from your brain  When you go into life autopilot and let your brain take you to do what it wants  it will make you roll up some weed and smoke it  because it is addicted to the routine  "You" know why you have to stop  and "You" are the one in control of your brain  Force willpower over your actions and stop letting your addicted zombie brain smoke weed  It's a tough internal battle against your very being  but it is possible because you are the ultimate boss  Fuck that noise  Yes  but I still do "monkmode"   I hope you really like the job  Oh Fuck ya  Reg doc visits are a peach  From how easy it is to find veins to draw blood  To the look of disgust  when they see the marks  Not to mention the sudden shift in care and policy  Pain meds for a broken hip fuck him hes a Junkie  Give him 500 mg Ibuprofen stat  I would laugh it it wasnt true and so fucking sad and wrong  Not today   It could be a regional area thing  Or maybe just a thing they do at his homegroup  Or just a thing he does  I've been to enough meetings in almost 5 years in NJ and I've never heard that      Ya  I should have clarified that while I don't feel dependent on alcohol  I do feel it is still a massive glaring problem in my life       My last bout involved getting off the commuter train several times on the way home to relieve my nausea  aka throwing up behind posts and hoping station attendants weren't watching  Not exactly the most  social behaviour       The worst however is being a lethargic sloth around the house all the next day  not getting anything done  As someone who's very driven to achieve my goals in life  this is beyond frustrating    Yeah I think I'm gonna talk to her  it can only help  I know at the end of the day though I have to be strong enough to do it  I have definitely been short on self care as I've been caring for others  I've learned that I do best with one small change and  if it is an action  that it is best done upon awakening  My January plan for self care is taking the first 30 minutes each day to do something for me  Right now  that's 30 minutes of yoga  If yoga ceases to be fulfilling  I'll switch to something else  No matter what  the first 30 minutes of my day will be for me so that I can continue to care for others for the remainder of the day   I will not drink today   Go to bottom of the page and turn "Restricted mode   On" I'm glad you all made it through  I just reread the slogan   the way I was pronouncing it is   Less Fiends in Twenty 17    I like   Less Fiends in '17   or maybe   No Fiends in '17   Congratulations on 100 days  I will not drink today  I'm reading a book called Mean Mothers and the beginning part is all about this great fallacy that our culture clings to that mothers are somehow  because they gave birth to us  loving  wonderful  and caring creatures   It's this kind of belief that has you and had me continually mistreated by our mothers  yet reliably going back for more and feeling uncertain about cutting ties with her   I cut my mom out of my life for a year about 10 years ago and I have not regretted it one time   After a lot of toxic and sabotaging behavior directed at me  I told her that I thought it would be best if we stopped communicating for awhile and that I would reach out to her when I was ready to speak again   About a year later she offered  through email  to do therapy with me  so that we could work on the relationship   At the end of about 8 sessions  the therapist told me our work was done and my mom and her needed to spend time individually working   To this day I have a relationship with her that more closely resembles an acquaintance   Again  this is something I feel great about   If you haven't read the book Boundaries  do so   It will help you figure out how to set boundaries with your mom and everyone else   Don't let anyone make you feel guilty or bad about your boundaries   If your boundary is that she can't be a part of things if she drinks  then you can know that if she missed your wedding  that wasn't something awful you did to her  as she might claim   but rather a choice she made   Set the boundary with her and let others know so that you can feel supported and she can't twist it   That will at least set the stage for her to own her actions  though it doesn't mean she will   If you simply back away and don't tell her  she might not get the message  she might get the message and blame you for neglecting her  and or you lose out on the opportunity to teach others how to treat you   That doesn't mean she won't try to retaliate  but unless you are worried about your physical safety  I say be very clear with her about your boundaries involving her   I'm sorry your mom is doing this  I was in a minor accident  not my fault   However police came and I was in the back of the patrol car filling out insurance info  answering questions   So glad I wasn't fucking drunk  as it was a time of my life that that could have easily been the case  and the accident could have been far worse  even a fatality    Good that you quit   just one of the many freedoms of sobriety  taking your life back feels so good   Don't worry  your balls will not explode  I can tell by personal experience as i am 6 days into NoFap  It will go away with time  your body will adjust accordingly  Great advice   It is worth it  I'm into nightly ice cream  but that's ok despite the fat around my belly  still smoking  but finally can see quitting in my future  In the beginning  my sponsor told me not to make any major decisions the first year  Stopping drinking and staying stopped one day at a time was and remains my priority over everything else  Whatever happens  I won't drink today  So many people are resistant to the religious dogma in AA  yet many continue go because there is something there that works for them  community  etc    My own personal approach when I went to AA was a combination of "fake it til you make it" and "take what you need and leave the rest "  That is  staying alcohol free was more important to me than the specifics of the program    But why would you want to do a thing like that  Yeh no more artificial nuts  all my nuts are going to be free range organic   But what about corn   I got a massive headache that lasted through days 6   7   Woke up today feeling pretty darn good  however   You never know what your body is doing to purge all the accumulated poison  and what nutrients and micronutrients have been depleted in order to accomplish that  I've been trying to eat as healthfully as I can  and added some green tea into the mix  I'm also taking some vitamins  For sure not a doctor though   Stand strong  fellow day eight er  We can do it  Welcome  When you can  check out the links on the sidebar  I will not drink with you today  Yeah I'm nearing 30 and am in a similar stage  I live in a big city where many people stay single into their mid 30s and maintain an early 20s lifestyle all the while  I recently attended an acquaintance's 33rd birthday party that included beer pong and people clogging the toilets with vomit by the end of the night  Of course not everyone continues on this way  but it's very easy to surround yourself with similar level partiers and never feel like it's a problem      I got a ride home   well I ride to an after party anyway but it was across the street from my house so the stumble home in the morning wasn't too bad   Of course I couldn't find my shoes so I wore my friends boyfriends slippers home   Still need to return those   Lol I'm also quitting after 8 9 years  Really tough  I've been going over two months  and am at 4gms a day now  from 40 60 day  Had to switch strains 5 days ago and staying at the same dose has jumped me back into more intense withdrawals  Holidays jacked up my taper too  It really is scary to see how few people are quitting from 5  years  though if you loook you see some long term users that have successfully quit with long tapers  I'm trying BSO next week to go cold turkey from  hopefully  2 5 grams  A week after that I'm at Disneyland for a week and hoping that'll distract me enough to push me through week 2   Weight of a teaspoon varies a lot due to things like grind and moisture content  I'd guess 1 2 grams a teaspoon  Maybe I'm way off though  I will not drink today  I will not drink today  I'm just angry about WD's  Well I'm not really withdrawing anymore  because I was able to down some soup and my bac is now probably too high to call this a taper anymore  I'm listening to the audiobook of the girl on the train  And I like it because there's finally some good descriptions of being an alcoholic and blackouts    But it also annoys me that the woman is able to not drink for a few evenings while my kindling is getting worse and worse    And can somebody just explain to me why it's legal to sell something you can die from when you suddenly stop consuming it after you did for a long time  Why doesn't a bottle have the same warnings cigarettes do    Going to stop whining now  Happy New Year Fap  Well  I drank more yesterday as well  I don't know why  But that whiskey is going down the drain this morning due to being "I never want to drink again" hungover this morning  Yeah  numbers don't lie      Big props for taking an inventory  It is a hugely useful piece of the process  I did this  too  first in 2013 and then compared to 2014 month to month when I really started my alcohol reduction  It became a healthy challenge  seeing how much I could reduce spend  Most months  I was 50 60  less than previous year  Kept a VERY simple journal to track  What I also liked was way less bottles clanging around in the house  going out to the garbage    I hate that sound  lol  Good luck   I've started back numerous times after a quit with the intention of only taking it a couple times per week  Every time has resulted in every day use within a matter of a few weeks  I'd highly recommend not taking it again  I won't drink today  I got too much life to live   This year I hope to   1  graduate 2  go to Cuba 3  win a fitness contest 4  meet  real  friends  One 00 is 1 2 grams depending on how tightly you stuff it  in my experience  To think I was shoving 40  capsules a day down my throat a few months ago is kind of disgusting  Having to hide capsules at work  sneak them through states where Kratom is scheduled  etc    SO ready to be done  Yeah    I love when they ask "where did all these bruises come from " all accusatory    Um  from y'all  I don't typically miss  ffs   To the drain it goes  Do I have to continue posting here about my updates or are there designated threads to do this  Yesterday after having a hangover from new years eve was really tough  but I managed to keep it up and I'm still going strong    Back to work tomorrow but I will be present for my family and I will not drink today There's an entry in the sub's FAQ about this   tl dr  more booze remains than most people realize   Whether that makes cooking with booze "okay" depends on each person   I avoid foods cooked with booze but allow some things like vanilla extract in cookies and soy sauce with my sushi  I know it sounds scary but your body is urging you to binge because it is chronically hungry  Start slowly upping your calories by a few hundred every couple of weeks until you're up to a normal level where the binge eating reduces   Start at 1500 and make sure you actually eat  even if you think you're not hungry  I'm also considering how it may be due to other factors that I was ignoring because I was attributing it to the alcohol and yet even with the removal of it are still present   vitamin deficiency  not enough iron  not enough nutrients  old sleeping habits  body clock routines etc    Our first thought is to assume it is linked with alcohol withdrawal  but perhaps it's something else entirely that now needs addressing since we're in a better mindset to approach and consider it  and subsequently rectify    I'll be making a conscious effort to eat better and trying to reset my alarm clock so I'm getting up early regularly  which is difficult as I work late most nights  and seeing if that helps remove some of those waking symptoms    I shan't drink with you either  Best of luck   I made a list of things to do to keep me occupied  but I find my mind always coming back to "I can drink while doing those things " I'm unsure of how to break out of that mindset   I appreciate the response  Here's to another day 1 I guess  That's oddly specific    I will not drink today  I will not drink today   I would love to pull out a few quotes from your post  but the whole damned thing was just so good   Setting aside your writing style  which I thoroughly enjoy  you'r choice of quotes alone was wonderful  but the whole thing was just fantastic   I really appreciate that you took the time to show us what your journey has been like   I love hearing from people who have made it a year  which seems an age in my newly sober mind    it does more than give me a sense that this IS do able  it also reminds me that it's not all good all the time  but by accepting the tools  resources  advice and opportunities I have at my disposal  I can do it too   Anyway  congrats on year 1  and thank you  I hope to post something like this on my 365th day  It gets easier  Im not much further ahead than you are  but I find that most or my cravings are situational based  For example  after morning coffee I want a smoke  After time  the cravings and desires are more bearable  and only last a few fleeting moments    I find that smoking an invisible cigarette helps when it gets really bad  Just pretend that you are smoking and the deep breaths calm me down   You got this   Thank you for the reply  I also managed depression and anxiety with alcohol  which naturally made both worse  ultimately  I also used alcohol to socialize  After all  alcohol lowers inhibitions   How else would I confide in others  and vice versa  without it  How else would I be witty and charming rather than my laconic and introverted self  Without booze  I will never be that person exactly  but I've discovered already that I'm just as willing to listen to a person in need and sharper without the booze   But yeah  that first week was full of me feeling flat and dull  And I will probably feel that from time to time for a while   I think it's because I trained my brain to think there is no other way to relax  socialize  or have fun  I have to unlearn what I have learned  and that will require patience   practice  and time    Have you considered attending a support group like Smart Recovery or AA as part of a non boozy activity to fill an evening   Or   for that matter  another type of support group    Wishing you all the best   But its fun to lie about it right   Junkies live such a carefree casual accepted lifestyle  Holy Fuck Ive never heard of a more stupid arguement than  his   And S I added an edit to my other reply  In case you missed it  Unlike no nuts I Want the facts here  Keep it up   Sounds like a fantastic deal  Love when shit like that works out   So shoes MIA or did he take them  I'm not sure which test you bought  but most of those have an associated lab that you can send them out to  It's not cheap  but if it proves your point then it might be worth it  If not  buy one that does have a lab today  Take it in front of her and go to the post office with her to mail it out  That gave me goosebumps  Thank you for sharing and so many congratulations on 2016  3 What  I think it's interesting that you put your state of mine  hungry  down  When I was in rehab  they told us this acronym HALT   hungry  angry  lonely  tired   that would make you more likely to slip   drink  So  you know  halt if you're feeling those things  Thus was my first nye sober  too   good job     Congratulations  What an honest  beautiful post  You are an inspiration    I will not drink with you today   Could be wrong  but I think they're mixing up Gastrointestinal Disorders  GID  with Generalized Anxiety Disorder  GAD   I'm in literally the same situation  except I'm a guy  My fianc is wonderful and she constantly has to babysit me  My advice for you is to realize your blessings and use them as motivation  I will not drink with you today  Day13   I'm at the point now where I feel like I've done it  I've gotten through the woods   I don't worry about how where and when I'm going to take another dose    I don't feel anxious   I haven't noticed paws at all during this process     Still feeling a little sluggish but that could be from the weekend of unusually heavy drinking     My only problem now is that little voice in my head that says hey a small dose would be really nice right to clear up that hangover    I probably should just go to the gym   That should clear that up     Happy new years everyone    I'm so happy for you  3 This is for people struggling to quit forever  If you are looking to restart  you are in the wrong place    As someone who is just starting  reading this really  really helped  Just the drinking  Don't need it today  there's too much to be thankful for  Happy to not drink with you all today   I'll not drink with you today  I protected myself from alcohol by not having any in my home  staying out of bars and away from anyone who abused it  There's nothing so boring as watching others overdrink  I stayed home or went to an AA meeting rather than put myself in risky situations   And we are so disposed   Keep going mate  I freed myself from debilitating bine drinking and now I'm set to graduate with my English BA in May and start teaching high school English in the Fall  None of these things would be possible without being sober  I won't drink with any of you today   Checking in Check out the naked mind  free on sidebar    the 30 Day Sobriety Book  I've also downloaded the apps Habit Seed and Nomo  I'm trying to keep myself busy with fun sober activities  I have a very similar story to yours   will not drink with you today   Rehab is the best option  in my opinion  It was one of my best decisions and started me on the road to recovery  They will know how to treat your withdrawal  or refer you to an appropriate detox center   make a note of those feelings    specifically how awful you felt  and how fearful you were  hae it on hand so when you next have an urge to drink  you can read it and remember  the pain of the next day is not worth the poison  i have been doing this the last day or two and it helped me through NYE Here we go  Round two and you'll be stronger for it  I'm here because I want to stop letting my wife down and getting so crazy drunk that I shout and scream at her about     everything  I'm not drinking with you today    Black mucus and phlegm  for over a month  it happens   Checking in Stay strong   the holidays were especially tough for me too  I told my family I don't drink anymore yet I was offered alcohol at least twice and even given beer and wine as a present   I said no and gave that shit away to friends I know who will enjoy it   I will not drink with you today  This is awesome  I'm not down the road that far  but found I have an urge drive come along with quitting to do other beneficial things  I'm not sure if it's a subconscious thing to stay busy  some desire to take better care of myself after years of neglect or what  I've been doing situps pushups at night  drinking a lot more water  and cleaning the hell out of my house   Over my xmas NY break my wife and I purged probably 10 paper bags of clutter from various rooms of the house  reorganizing the kids' toys and whatnot  Maybe it's just that I'm not obsessed with going outside every hour or so to smoke and I actually notice have energy and time to devote to things I've put off or ignored  In any case  it feels amazing   Just wanted to say I think I can relate a little and good for you  I  too  have really enjoyed the freedom I feel from not smoking  Like "What do I want to do " with the answer being literally "anything" vs  never taking on "too much" before as it would prevent me from smoking     Great work and thanks for sharing  You're the one who started it yesterday   I know that feeling of waking up    like with eyes WIDE open thinking  "wtf    how did I even get in my bed "    It's the worst     Having the anxiety of going through my phone just terrified of what I could have sent people  or asked for     I am not drinking today with you   Let's do this  If you break down the amount of alcohol you would actually receive from eating a dish cooked with beer or wine  it's very very minimal    For instance  if you poured a whole bottle of wine into a stew  five drinks  and let it cook for an hour  it'd retain approximately 1 25 drinks total  If you think about it  pretty much any stew large enough to accommodate a whole bottle of wine is going to have alot of portions in it    So imagine that 1 25 drinks being split 6 or 8 ways  Even with seconds and large portions  IOW an  extreme  circumstance   you'd be getting less than half a drink    Point being  although there is clearly a school of thought that claims alcohol is so "cunning" that even a single drop  literally  should be avoided  there is another that would basically say   is it more disruptive to your joy happiness to feel you can't cook with wine than it is to ingest a very small quantity of booze in your food  Because realistically  things like over ripe fruit and all manner of sauces and condiments have little bits of alcohol in them    Speaking only for myself  those little anomalies were never my problem  Mine was with purchasing booze in a glass and consuming it liberally and repeatedly for hours  days or weeks at a time    So I will always drink Kombucha  would have a NA beer if it appealed to me and although I rarely cook with wine  wouldn't hesitate to do so if a recipe called for it  But I'd never  ever take a glass of beer  martini  etc to my lips    Just my 2c  Not fair  indeed  I don't think I was ever not drinking when I got the flu until a couple of weeks ago  I was rather amazed at the similarities of shittiness between a hang over and the flu  Who knew  I did something similar to you  Smoked about the same amount daily for nearly a decade and threw away  1000 worth of paraphernalia and took it one day at a time  I actually cried the night before because it felt like I was saying goodbye to a part of myself    and I was scared of who I'd become without it  That was almost two years ago now  Incredibly  the urges are still there    almost as if I had smoked yesterday  They are most strong when I'm bored  Watching movies  playing video games    none of it has the same appeal as it used to  Exercise has been the most crucial component for me    My best advice is to tell you that you'd be doing yourself a disservice if you think it's going to be easy  And the recovery from addiction never really ends  even with a substance like weed    Besides exercise  it's really important to find a new hobby or passion to replace all the time you used to spend getting high  For me  it was making music  but for others it might not be as simple as that  I think most marijuana addicts are always going to be addicted to something    it's just part of our personality  So the trick is to find a healthy alternative  Good luck  My intention is that if I'm out and about  I'll eat things cooked in alcohol  but won't use it to cook at home   I doubt I could stop myself from drinking what was left    Hi  I'm trying today to go to 3 grams  New Years Eve was awful with shaking  depression  racing heart and dizziness  Went to a restaurant for dinner and the noise and lighting made me feel horrible  Went to bed at 7 pm although very hard to sleep  This is the first time I have felt this horrible  Today is easier except for these nasty cravings  Kratom is constantly on my mind  The psychological part is very hard because the first thing I go for when awakening is that first dose  I'm very anxious  so lethargic and down   Why not  If I may ask  AA made you toss those drinks back  Just ran my first 4k since a while  That should help me through day 2    Hello me  Yup  I am also in the same situation  drinking til I black out  behaving horrifically  swearing 'never again' then doing it all over again   Same  guilt  embarrassment  the whole package  over and over and over again   And the fear of failing   If I try and fail  that's so much worse   But  failure is not inevitable  and it is possible to stop   It IS   This is a great place to be for advice and friendly  non judgemental support   People here have all reached a point where they realise they can't  won't go on as they are  so there is no need to cover things up   My advice  for what it's worth  I am pretty new to this   is to read the posts here  talk openly here about your fears and worries  use the resources listed on the sidebar  the books and FAQs especially     If you can  find someone in real life that you can speak to  doctor  trusted friend or family members  counsellor etc   and be brutally honest about the situation     You can do this  you have support here  and I will not drink with you today    Here's a resource that you can browse  Hope it helps  I'm sorry this is happening  Others have given you excellent suggestions      http   kidshealth org en teens coping alcoholic html Good for you  I will not drink with you today  x Welcome  I won't drink with you today    i absolutely agree  the past year or more   ive learned a lot when it comes to relapsing in a healthy way    or even just dealing with any kind of failure in a healthy way  i like to 1  come to terms with my bad guilty feelings 2  find something to feel good about 3  brush off my shoulders and keep going  The hardest part is  2  I like to look back at how addicted i used to be  even just 2 years go  and think about how ive gotten to where i am today So glad you can share the knowledge  Happy New Year   Yeah  that was me  too   LOVE this  Will give it a try today when I start to feel listless  Thanks for posting  Thank you hexqueen  Happy New Year   Oh I see  that's good     Why do you think that the community needs to be harder on you  Is it because you think that is what will trigger the inner change  It sounds like you don't have the confidence that you can create that change on your own   There is something psychologically holding you back  and until now you have never successfully stuck to your plans because you are not aware of what it is that's holding you back   You gotta try to figure that out   Are you comfortable with serious introspection   5 days is something for sure  I must have tried to quit 100 times  most of them lasting about a day or less  It's so crushing to go to bed so determined and wake up with literally none of the resolve I had the night before   So  yeah  when something like a day 3 or 5 rolls around it feels like riding a bike with no training wheels for the first time  Celebrate away and be proud  Update  chatted it out with my housemate  She didn't realise it made me uncomfortable and won't bring him over as often or for as long  and if he is over he won't be in the communal spaces so I can cook in my pants and not feel weird  I really think my sobriety is allowing me to be a grown up and sort things like this out quickly  Rather than dwell and get angry  Hooray  The liquor industry is covered because they tell you to drink responsibly   https   youtu be EJT0NMYHeGw I will not drink today  That is impressive    Do you still have to make a big effort not to drink after so long  While I agree with  u mj0r I think this comment is both a bit harsh and naive  People have gone back out over the most trivial of things  A broken shoelace was the infamous one in my old home group  Kratom could definitely do it if the person was not ready to give up    If you think an active opioid like Kratom could not be the trigger to get you back on the needle then I strongly suggest you reevaluate your complacency  There's book in the side bar called This Naked Mind  give it read  it helps a lot and you can join IRC as well  thanks for the response      the thing that really bothers me is i tell them straight up  i am an alcoholic  and i cannot be trusted to drink alcohol  i will drink myself to a very early grave if i do not stop  im 22  etc etc  obviously i cannot make them stop drinking themselves          but it feels like i am trying to quit heroin  and all my immedeate family have needles and and dope lying around the house  because thats what alcohol has become for me  a hard drug that i only take alone  and for them they need at every single social event    and i keep wanting to distance myself from them  and i am not sure if that is a wise choice or not  The 4th step should also include positive characteristics  not just negatives  It's also important to do a fifth step as soon as you can  This is an important growth step  Feeling shame and regret is normal and healthy  When we are sober  it is much less likely we will engage in the behaviors that are causing you pain now  They are in the past  not today  You have changed  Wouldn't it be sad if you were so cold and hardened that you didn't feel regret   I avoided parties where alcohol was central for the first 3 or four months sober  Now that we are out of the holiday season  for the most part  that shouldn't be too hard to avoid  Once I was comfortable with my sober self I found it much easier than I thought possible to go and have fun with friends without drinking  I make sure to bring my favorite NA drink  usually some kind of spicy ginger ale  bonus points if it looks a bit like a beer bottle   and have a plan to leave early if I get uncomfortable  Best wishes  Day 13 here  I am exactly where you are at too    libido and appetite are in full swing  been drinking pretty frequently  im mostly fine but sleep is hit or miss  Last couple lines in your post resonate heavily with me  bagfullofbuckles  Lets fight this shit  And TypicalStoryTime  youre almost over the hump my man  Youll be feeling GREAT so so soon It's really interesting to just observe now   and be grateful we got out  Not today  Yassss   You're awesome  The storm before the calm  Pearl stay right here and ADJUST  You know a few days and back to good  You

could relate so much to everything you wrote   My life was a total mess too   I couldn't see it then  could only see some of the problems  many others I blamed on circumstance or other people   but I see it very clearly now   Mentally I was a wreck   Numb  apathetic  irritable  hating myself  resentful at life  making horrible decisions with major consequences   I felt completely stuck and hopeless   I couldn't clearly see my problems  and I couldn't see the connections between every one of my problems and my compulsive gaming   Today it's crystal clear   Constant gaming and sleep deprivation were trashing every single area of my life   I also couldn't see light at the end of the tunnel back then   Today the light is all around me  I'm living life and walking through the tough stuff  taking care of myself  engaging with people  learning  growing  appreciating   My motivation has come back to life   I'm more often positive than negative these days   I see the progress I've made and the actions I had to take to get here and I'm motivated to keep putting one foot in front of the other and enjoying the journey   When I was in the depths of the addiction  it's like I had a thick black cloud around my head  blinding me to the reality of my situation and the possibilities that lie beyond   That darkness seemed impenetrable and permanent   But that was an illusion   I just needed some support and guidance in getting honest with myself  taking effective action  avoiding self destructive action  and accepting what I needed to heal and learn and grow   If you want to

definitely true  I was on this sub every 40 to 60 minutes until day 6 or 7   That plus youtube sitting in bed  hoping for 20 minute naps while on my Gatorade drip   Since I've started some books  have great support from wifey  saw a doctor    even tried NA beer so I could still enjoy pizza   football   I've been super busy with moving and looking for a new career so that has helped   Meditation is

great many of us did not come from a background of heavy problem drinkers  if not downright alcoholics  It's an environment and possible genetic component at work  I know that's true of my family too  In my case  it made my family super uncomfortable to find out I'd quit drinking  I think because it made them question their own consumption  I learned to have patience with them  and make my excuses and leave early if feeling uncomfortable  There is no need to cut yourself off from your family  but I made room in my life to care for myself first  which felt a bit selfish but was really what I needed  Now that I am much firmer in my sobriety I have no problem being around people who drink  even to excess  Best wishes  I am halfway with you   Quitting smoking at the same time would be tough   I have slowed down my smoking tho    and I am confident that with no more drinking  which when I drink heavy  easily I smoke a pack at night    I will eventually be there with you   Best of luck  Glad to hear that man  Stay away from those  I'm on my last pack currently   Parents house  Their wine  I will not buy it ever again  Not even to cook  Yes  and no  The physical urge fades over time however even that is still a trap  and a pretty big one  Just because I have not had a drink in a long time does not mean I don't have a problem with it and it gets easy to forget that which  leads back to 'since I have not had a drink in a long time  maybe I could have one ' yeah That is the little reminder that I still have an issue with the drink and I still have to have my guard up and go to meetings  It is that cunning for me  Otherwise I am literally able to go long spans of time without even thinking about booze  but just because the physical urge is gone  the mental one is still there from time to time  Well  day two and I'm not experiencing anything physically wrong  just a bit nervous and mentally fried but I'm not sure if it's the lack of alcohol or something else  I'll keep an eye out and make sure everything else is good   Aw  man  my eyes are leaking  So glad you're here with us  Thank you so much for sharing your story  I will not drink with you today   I used to do this  Didn't work too well for me  I got real tired of people telling me how they don't drink as much as they use to  And the ones that are still where I was seem a little uncomfortable with me  I have new friends now  It takes time  If the reason for these events is to get drunk  I wouldn't even consider it  Remember the reason your going if you do and always have an escape plan  Good luck Thank you for taking time to tell us your story  You are an inspiration   Hello and welcome  I'm glad you're eyes are opening  I hope you'll find this sub is just where you need to be      I'm a day or two late to the game  but have been clean since the end of December    so sign me up if possible  Else  I'll just check in as I go  Happy new year  all  If they go back then thats on them  I'm talking about using kratom as a stepping stone  I will not drink today   I found it really helpful  as a result of reading  The Easy Way   to reflect on what nicotine is was really doing for me  Like back in time  what was my 7th grade self lacking that improved upon taking in nicotine  Did it improve anything   All I could really ever come up with was feeling sort of a dizzy rush for a few seconds and fitting in with the kid I wanted to think I was cool   Fast forward 15 years  What was nicotine doing for me  I honestly couldn't answer the question  I was waaaay past the point of saying stuff like "it relieves stress" or "it relaxes me " I just believed I needed nicotine  but couldn't verbalize any specific reason  It was more that I was scared about not having it or losing out on  something   even though I couldn't name it  that made stopping seem terrifying and impossible   A lot of the time it wasn't this conscious  but I noticed feeling antsy  irritable  distracted  thoughts running a mile a minute  etc  when I'd try to quit  perhaps like you're describing    I posted about the mental quandary I was in  here  https   www reddit com r stopsmoking comments 5hsrh5 easy way subscribers help processing my  if you want to take a look  It finally came down to believing that nicotine is the reason I felt like nicotine did something for me  Rationally  I couldn't name anything so what should be the big deal about stopping  Why should I feel antsy about quitting something where I can't even name a genuine pleasure benefit improvement    Anyway  I share this way of thinking as I hope you can get to the point some way or another where you aren't in a "battle " This last time for me I didn't experience any cravings at all  I have some hyper awareness  like "I don't think I'm craving  Am I craving  No  I'm not  But am I "  about being a non smoker  but not anguish or feeling miserable  It's been great  The times where I've had to grit my teeth constantly have always led to me crumbling  This approach  where I don't "fight" anything because I don't even think nicotine would provide me anything desirable  has been wonderful   Good luck to you and congratulations on both your time without a cigarette as well as continuing to push for self improvement  I'm 2  Feeling good  Nice not to wake up with a headache      We're glad you have you here  It's been good to see your username again  You know what really pisses him off  When you mispronounce it with a southern accent  Deeewaaars   Thanks for the wishes  I guess I wasn't trying to avoid the parties because most were pretty important in some way or another  I was also testing myself in a way since alcohol is embedded into my friends culture but they are the kind of people that can put half a glass down and be done which was never me  I have been using black coffee as a go to though when I feel it's getting to be too much or I need a pick me up  Yay for round 2  Hop on up here and tell us how it happened and what you learned    so we can learn  Welcome back  2016 was a rough year to stay sober in  that's for sure  Take it easy  I posted about this yesterday simply b c my 2016 ran similarly  I spoke with my father about my lackluster performance in my efforts to quit and he provided the following perspective  Paraphrasing  he explained to me that 2016 was my 1st year that I attempted to quit drinking and it didn't go perfectly  He explained that it was okay  He explained that I am quitting something that I have relied on for everything  celebrations  failures  love  heartbreaks  lifts  losses  coping essentially   for over a decade  He explained that it will take time  He explained that this scotch will be my last drink ever  He explained that 2016 was my 'crawl'  He explained that 2017 will be my 'walk' and 'run'   Use 2017 to 'run'    Good luck and congrats on starting up again    Thank you  It is hard not wanting to jump but i will stay on course  Mexico isn't until the end of January and I want to be feeling a little better by then  The weather here is so cold with very little sun right now  It seems to get harder on the bones the older I get  I am hoping a week in the sun will be a boost   Thanks  I'm doing my fifth step in a few days  I guess I just need some time between now and these realizations about myself    u otitropanit is right   Here is a link to find Alateen meetings in the U S  http   al anon info MeetingSearch AlateenMeetings aspx language EN This is a support group for young people affected by someone else's drinking   You could help your siblings find a way to get to their nearest meeting   I've heard teens say that even though they resisted this idea at first  they are glad someone made them go   My first check in of 2017  Happy New Year everyone  I wish you all happiness and peace  I will not drink with you today Right on and all the more power to you    I was just trying to say there are several schools of thought and that by no means is there a unanimous consensus among  say  medical professionals that trace amounts of ethanol in food have any bearing on one's decision to be abstinent  My own GP looked at me like I was crazy when I asked about this once   I like to make an Italian Zuppa Di Pesce once a year  well  I should say that I can  afford  to make it once a year       and cannot imagine leaving out the white wine  Just looked up my recipe though and realized it calls for 25 ml per serving  IOW about 1 6th of a glass  before  cooking   Cheers and good luck  You got this   I will not drink today  No matter what happens  I will face the night without dulling my senses  hard as that may be  good going for 16days  well done  I most certainly need to go back to doctors regards depression  I put this off as the thought of anti depressants scares me  but its got to be better than the self medicating with alcohol that Ive been doing  Thank you  your words mean a lot  its been a long time since anyone told me they are proud of me  And yes please it would be great to know others are not drinking with me today and i am not alone  So  so  so  so true  This is awesome and I am so grateful for moments like this as well  I've also been late and winded  not ridiculously but enough where I really have to focus on breathing "normal"  after a couple flights of stairs heading to a meeting  Picking a seat in the room sort of removed from people  not looking at them directly when I talk  always having coffee to try and mask the smell  carrying baby wipes in my car to wipe my hands face  etc   I was a major closet smoker  terrified of anyone at working knowing so it required jumping through  a lot  of hoops  It really made me ashamed of who I'd become due to my addiction  Avoiding after work get togethers because they'd be in close quarters and I always wanted to smoke first thing after work  Trying to avoid giving people rides in case my car smelled  Going in to work late and leaving early to smoke more  It's crazy what I did for cigarettes   Thanks for sharing this  It's a really good reminder that there's these sorts of opportunities for gratitude aaaaallll around to be thankful for each day  'Run' with us in 2017  Utilize r SD as your source of spiritual hydration  sustenance  and support   Keep on and good luck  We all can do it      I agree    I have quit smoking for 3 years I think  However  I will smoke about 3 5 cigarretes a YEAR  But I do not count them as relapse as I have beaten the awful habit of smoking  Max is right  You can stop this right here  right now  I don't ever need to feel like that again  I hated it and it really scared me  Turns out that feeling like that is optional  It's my option to choose  All mine  Yours too  Jump in with us here at SD  Let's not drink today  I'm here  I'll be sober today  I woke up feeling down and quite annoyed at life for no apparent reason  O' well     "You will not be punished for your anger  you will be punished by your anger " That's a big one for me  I can sometimes  feel  my liver when I'm in bed  A huge part of giving up booze is so I don't develop alcohol induced hepatitis at some point  or if it just packs up entirely  Thanks for the comment  it's definitely one of the biggest reasons  I know when I first stopped I felt overwhelmed  The thoughts of shame  guilt  remorse  angst  all threatened to drown me    What worked for me was to try and ignore the big picture  forget ALL the regret of the past  ALL the times I'd embarrassed myself  ALL the times I'd driven drunk and the shame that created    In the past  I would have a few drinks and could ignore all the noise in my head  But then I just decided on not drinking in that moment  I simply narrowed my focus  putting blinders on  what can I do TODAY to put myself in the best position to NOT drink    Then  after I strung a few sober days together  the noise started to subside  I felt stronger  more capable of facing all those things I'd done wrong  and trying to build a life where I wouldn't do them again    So my advice is to narrow your focus to what you can change today  no drinking  no "buzzed" driving  no black outs  no embarrassing episodes  The rest will come in time  Good luck  HALT has helped me a few times  I add an S for sick in case I'm catching a cold  It also helps me keep my temper with others  Are they hungry  Angry  Etc  This also helps me to not drink  People ask me why I stopped drinking  The problem is  the original reason becomes harder to say because my reasons are both increasing and evolving  As time goes by  drinking again seems to become less of an option  I suspect this is partly due to my identity   self perception evolving   I'm simply becoming a different person from making lasting positive decisions  It's a nice feeling  It's not a failure if you can learn something from it  It took me a number of stops and starts to 'get it ' I like the idea of printing it out and reading it  I keep a journal for that reason  Long after I've forgotten how bad it was  all it takes is a quick read through to remember why I don't drink anymore  Good luck  Woot  woot    You came to a good place  my friend  This is a great supportive community  It is going to be hard at first  You have to get through the first few days  but eventually  it will get better  You are strong  You can do this  We will be here for you to vent to   Back to the restaurant where I am the only bartender  I will not drink today  no matter how tempting  Barely 1000 is not a good day  Restricting is as bad if not worse than bingeing  You need to change your mindset   Any idea how long it takes for a gaming addict's brain to return to normal  I've been addicted to pvp games on and off for maybe 15 years now  Is there any stat on how long it'd take for my brain to return to normal after quitting  Its awesome to here someone say they 'stepped off' and it was okay  That's the whole point of the taper  right  I'm just gonna keep chipping away  I only ended up taking 19 grams yesterday  instead of 20    basically just taking as little as possible and saving it for before bed  I ended up having more than enough to get through the night  so I did well  Today I'll give myself up to 20 grams and if I need the whole thing  that's okay  20 grams is not nothing  but it's a hell of a lot less than I was taking  I AM ready to quit  I can only see things getting worse if I don't  My eyes are open  and once that happens  it's impossible to go back to your own ways without that voice constantly reminding you of what you're getting yourself into  I already feel way different  I was pretty numbed up from that stuff  I'm ready to learn to live with myself without being altered   even if it is hard  And I don't wanna hurt myself anymore    I love FR  I had the opportunity to see them earlier in 2016  before I got sober  Beautiful show  Wonderful song  Thanks for sharing     I will not drink today  Brilliant  Schedule the 5th step  and get it done  You'll hear people say that most people go back out at the 4th step and the 9th step  I felt terrible after completing my 4th step  I ignorantly sat in that feeling for 2 months  before someone recognized what was going on and recommended the above  The cathartic feeling didn't come from writing it out for me  The cathartic feeling came from admitting to God  myself  and another human being the exact nature of my wrongs  Sitting in the 4th step is a bad place to linger  Get the 5th step scheduled  and the sooner the better  Know that what you're feeling right now is natural  It shouldn't feel great to look at our character defects  especially when we've been blind to them  The fact that you feel the way you feel  is proof that you've done a thorough and honest 4th step  You're exactly where you're supposed to be  Now move forward  I will not drink with you   My best memories were of sober summers just enjoying life as it should be   Keep drawing on the good times you had in your sober summer     i will not drink today Your whole first paragraph describes me so well too  And regards the obsession I hear you on that one  I realised recently even although I dont drink from the minute my eyes open  I am thinking about it usually to convince myself I won't drink that evening  which changes throughout the day to "i will just have a couple" then depending on how day pans out will result in a 12 pack  You have done amazingly to manage 86 days and I want to be there as well  Thank you for your support  Awesome job making a tough decision  Keep strong  and good things will come   Okay  so u do get me  I've done cold turkey off full blown opiates and the physical stuff was awful  The mental part sucked but Kratom is definitely more challenging for me  I'd totally check into a psych ward if I could do it  That's just plain responsible   That's definitely how I feel  I gave up booze in Thailand for a couple of weeks and I found myself just going for long solitary walks by myself and becoming a little introverted because I genuinely thought people would be bored of me without alcohol in me  I think you're right about un learning things  I hope it goes well for you   I'm a little concerned about the support groups  My main concerns are     I don't want to be the guy sat there whilst everyone pours their hearts out  and I really have nothing to say other than 'I developed an addiction predominantly out of selfishness with no real reason to do so'   I'm concerned that groups like AA teach you that you do not have control over your disease  and therefore you must engage in a 12 step programme or something similar  Correct me if I'm wrong  but aren't a lot of AA groups concurrent with almost religious organisations  about relinquishing control to a higher power and engaging solely in the programme  I'd love to be able to talk to people impartially about my addiction  but I don't want to be part of any kind of group where you get a chip or something for every week without alcohol  That for me just makes me feel like it's  only a matter of time  until you relapse  something I don't want to do   Thanks a lot again for your continues replies    You're the one in control of your actions   You  did the hard work   congratulations  I understand the sentiment  And I agree  even though it would not have worked for me  However  I was replying to the context of your comment  It is entirely possible to end up back on the street from Kratom  With it been a steeping stone in the other direction  back to H  for some  Hence the broken shoelace example  Keep smelling awesome  Awesome  Congrats     Where I clung to my expectations about what life was supposed to be  about what I deserved  that's where I suffered  How limiting  if I were the one to decide my experience  It's a big  beautiful  terrifying world out there  and I can't wait to see what tomorrow brings   That's a great observation  I'm sticking it in my stopdrinking quote bag     Yeah  I was thinking a gradual approach  too  Now that I have taken my first step down  hopefully the next will be easier  I had a buddy switch from cigs to pot  He said once he got to a certain nicotine level in his juice  he began smoking pot and got a similar gratifying effect to cigs  Then after 8 or 10 months of pot  he tried a cig again and he wanted to gag after one puff  I don't make 75K a year like he does  so he can afford this solution        Good to hear   Not drinking with you today      hoose Life  Choose a job  Choose a career  Choose a family  Choose a fucking big television  choose washing machines  cars  compact disc players and electrical tin openers  Choose good health  low cholesterol  and dental insurance  Choose fixed interest mortgage repayments  Choose a starter home  Choose your friends  Choose leisurewear and matching luggage  Choose a three piece suit on hire purchase in a range of fucking fabrics  Choose DIY and wondering who the fuck you are on Sunday morning  Choose sitting on that couch watching mind numbing  spirit crushing game shows  stuffing fucking junk food into your mouth  Choose rotting away at the end of it all  pissing your last in a miserable home  nothing more than an embarrassment to the selfish  fucked up brats you spawned to replace yourselves  Choose your future  Choose life      But why would I want to do a thing like that         Sigh  it's your quote dude  I am literally in the same boat as you but I haven't quit cigs yet  not for a lack of trying   How did you go about that  I've tried weening and cold turkey and failed at both  Thank you   Thank you  I would also love to know where to find them  Well done on your great week  I have kept myself isolated so I can just get on with drinking myself to death without other peoples pity or disappointment  Coming on here today is the best thing I have done in a long time   Who gave you an at home drug test  and why   Also  has your girlfriend ever been to a Nar Anon or Al Anon meeting  or to  r AlAnon or the slow moving  r NarAnon  I saw them a few years ago   great show  great band  so many powerful songs  On their site  they sell shot glasses with "I wish I was sober" printed on them   it's amazing how transparent the lying And minimizing is when you are sober  also  sad   Congrats on 1 year   100 days  i was definitely a bit harsh for no reason  didn't really help get my point across   just woke up for work when i commented and i'm a cranky morning person  i don't really see the naivety in my comment but i could certainly be missing something  like you said anything can send someone back out if they are not ready to stop which include kratom of course  if they are ready to stop then they will stop and kratom will not put them back on the street  if it does put them back on the street they were not ready to stop  It's good for me to hear this    I've heard that voice you're talking about today  since I have not had a drink in a long time  maybe I could have one    and I'm just at day 2    It's good for me to know that that is not going anywhere anytime soon and I have to keep my guard up  It's inspiring for me to hear from someone who has been able to do so for so long  Thanks Well done and for not giving up after a set back  its not easy to do that  The support you have offered is helping me so much  Not OP but mine were SO much worse  and usually lasted 2 days  I got horrendously drunk on New Year's Eve but feel great today  I had never heard of pancreatitis until recently    About three weeks ago I started to get a pain in my left side just below my ribcage that wouldn't go away  I had been bloated for months and figured it was just what it felt like to be fat  gained 40 lbs over the past 2 years   I was used to occasional pains on the other side of my body  liver   but this was a new one  and much  much worse  Didn't want to eat  Heartburn every afternoon  When it just got worse and worse  I looked up my symptoms and knew immediately it was pancreatitis    Had one drink the next three nights to taper and none ever since  Pain went away within a day or two of tapering  Bloating is gone  no more heartburn  It's good to feel sort of young again   Sometimes a life or death scare is the kick in the pants we need to turn our life around   Thank you so much for sharing  You can do it  this is my day 1  we will keep each other in check I will not drink today  My sleep has been awful too  I already had a problem staying up way too late and not smoking has made it much harder to go to sleep  I've been getting 4 5 hours of crappy sleep a night  I actually just woke up from one of my first uninterrupted 8 hours  had a dream for the first time in months  but still feeling kind of groggy for sure  Oh well one improvement at a time I guess See  I get confused cuz grams is weight and a teaspoon is volume  I'm just capping my Kratom in the 00 caps  Each cap is about  5 grams  I figure the main thing is that u have to have some way to know that you're taking less  As long as u can tell that ur taking less  u know you're getting somewhere  The caps are a way I can do that    I'm scared too  but I also know that it can be done and fear is how we torture ourselves  even if nothing bad is actually happening to us  I'm trying to keep the fear in check  A little less over time and eventually that'll be very little and then nothing  I'm sorry you're stuck in this  but hey  we're together  right  R u gonna get a scale  A capping thing   Good luck  We all came to that point where we say enough is enough  You have a good community here that will be there for you when you are struggling  Soon  you will be at a place where YOU can help those people starting the same journey  Stay strong  It takes will power   You can call yourself whatever   an alcoholic  a problem drinker  someone who doesn't drink   The list of options is almost endless but as long as you are comfortable with how you understand the definition  that is okay for now    I prefer to say that I have a medical condition and that condition is called Alcohol Use Disorder   Do bear in mind that although you are comfortable with the term 'alcoholic'  calling yourself that to too many people may have results that you don't intend    The term alcoholic still has a stigma attached to it  and though that shouldn't be the case  the fact is that it is   People may not trust you as much as you would hope because they have a pre conceived idea of the word that doesn't match your description of it   They may understand the term alcoholic to be a weak willed individual who will lie and cheat and steal   You have already seen that as people put 2 and 2 together and reach 5  because they expected this definition to have been the reason that you were homeless   Alcohol Use Disorder is a spectrum  a range of conditions from mildly dependent to binger to highly dependent   It is a recognised medical term  for a medical condition   And most importantly  it is a term that does not give off so many negative vibes for people who have never experienced alcoholism and take their definition for it from the movies  and soap operas   which usually portray a dependent drinker is such a negative light   Those with diabetes don't call themselves a sugar addict  they say that they have diabetes which is a medical condition   People don't automatically jump to the conclusion that the person was a weak individual for eating too much of the wrong stuff and not exercising enough  Some great points here   I've been looking into karezza and find it very intriguing  because we equate sex to orgasm  but karezza limits orgasm  yet encourages sex   I wonder if we all have a false premise about orgasm being a positive for mental health   I used to think so  but my husband and I are on a 90 day reboot mard mode and we are happier  more affectionate  more interactive  respectful  loving  but damn is it FRUSTRATING at times   Plus my husband's ass is huge and perfect  so that doesn't help me any when he's changing in front of me   UGH god   K   Done perving out   Anyways  about the whole lusting and appreciating women's bodies  I think that's okay so long as it's not solely a sexual feeling   Women  are  beautiful   But especially with porn addiction  it's hard for some to view women's bodies and think anything but sex  like objectifying them   I feel like it's a confusing grey area   We're programmed to seek healthy mates that will benefit us in procreating and spreading our genes advantageously  but with the advent of false images  porn  magazines  tv  our brain is being super charged by potential mates that are perfect by the boatload  and we aren't designed to really handle that from an evolutionary perspective   Our brains don't know the difference between projections of images vs real people  despite us consciously understanding they aren't real  according to Satoshi Kanazawa  an evolutionary psychologist  and flippin genius    So  it's tough to know about that  and what kind of appreciation is okay   I once read a great point about lusting after women   A guy said  it's not similar to a landscape or a rainbow   You can't have sex or have a relationship with or interact with a landscape or a rainbow   That point stuck with me   I do know that my husband and I have a rule that we don't check people out around eachother  because it's hurftul  but we kind of understand that it happens outside of eachother's presence    I can say from personal experience that appreciation of someone can slip easily to extreme lust   I have no good suggestions on how to stop that  I had a coworker that one day I noticed how attractive he was  and then i full on was sexualizing him and checking out his ass and thinking really dirty thoughts all day at work  and sometimes dreaming about him   I could not have a normal interaction with him necause I was perving out on him hardcore and was awkward and not listening to him or having normal conversations   I think that was unfair to him  not healthy for my marriage  although my husband checked people out all the time around me  so I wasn't very comverned about his feelings at the time and negative   So  i dunno about all that   Maybe focusing energy on the significant other  if you have one  and building a strong healthy relationship takes care of most of that   I know that when things were good with my husband  I wasn't interested in other men to the point of perving out   great post with a lot of great thoughts and ideas   Thank you   3 Yep    My life as well as you know    I really enjoy losing absolutely everything repeatedly  It's fucking fantastic   Just do it    i did this for thirty years  don't wait 30 years    i can't even tell you how much better my life is today than it was on this day one year ago  my only regret is that i wasted so much time   Did you make it past New Years  Not being offensive just hoping you made it through without alcohol  Oh fucking thanks Fash       It is truly amazing when someone can stick to something like this for two months  4 grams day is so little  lol  Good job   I'm curious why you had to switch strains  I'm thinking I have enough to stick with the same strain the whole way  However  I'll have to open new bags  which bugs me  because each batch can be a little different  I'm using half green Maeng Da and half natural Thai    I thought a teaspoon was 3 5 grams  I'm very likely wrong tho  Lol  I've capping my doses with the 00 caps   Same story here  Except I messed up a couple of months earlier than December    I join you in another round and am not drinking tonight goddammit  Let's do this  My girlfriend's sister in law just passed away a couple months ago having the same drinking habits of you  She'd been doing it for 20 years tho  bottle of wine or two a night to herself  all while having a loving husband and daughter  She just couldn't make it for them tho  I only mention this because it happened and it's very real and very scary  You're taking the right steps and I'm so happy you're going ahead  Keep it up   Just about the same thing happened to me  I was nauseous when I went to bed NYE and spent yesterday watching TV  which I never do all day because it gives me trouble sleeping  Instead I slept last night for hours and didn't wake up today until 10 30  I haven't slept that late since I was drinking  I feel absolutely fine now  Maybe it was a sympathetic hangover   And I'm damn proud of us  too  This is an awesome story   Thanks for sharing  This   IS   a great place isn't it   Enjoy your day  Dude  I'm shoveling 40 caps down my throat a day and I thought that was 20 grams  Maybe I have zero idea what I'm taking and need to go buy a scale after all   sign me up  please Not you  u mj0r  I meant for the comment I replied to  I name dropped you as I agreed with your comment  You went about saying it in the right way in my book  The poster of the comment above  the OP   did not   Damn man  you're hardcore  I've been kind of easing myself back into it  Although  my first week I had a couple of beers and watched game 7 of the World Series with some friends  But yeah  that was definitely quitting on hard mode  Shit   haha  This sub was my main support in getting sober  I like that I could browse at my leisure and find ideas and inspiration  it was good to know I wasn't alone in my struggles and goals   I attended SMART Recovery for a while after about 9 months sober  I already knew I aligned with their approach and it was nice to get some face to face contact with other people in recovery  My approach is self empowered and I've found tools and techniques from both SMART and Cognitive Behavioural Therapy to be useful  If he comes for a rebuttal Im not sure to be in awe for the nerve or in awe for the pure stupidity of him  Lets  see what course of action he takes   I would just like to say  If reading this numbnuts just keep going  Nothing to see  or gain here so just keep walking  Thank  You  Wow  that's a frightening story  I think you're very lucky to not have killed or seriously harmed yourself  your friends  or innocent drivers and their families    Do you think you want to quit  I kept drinking after my second DUI and things only got worse  I'm 31 now and I wish I had stayed sober the first time I got clean  at 20  It only got worse for me  Even when I wasn't driving due to suspension  bad things kept happening   I think this could be a great opportunity for you to make some changes in your life and have a happy and healthy 2017  It may get worse before it gets better  but drinking helps nothing  in my experience   Sorry you're dealing with the fallout from this  but I'm happy everyone is alive and safe   Thank you  I need this  I am on day 2 again  It feels like it has been weeks though  It is all I can think about   this is a great post  i barely made any wanking motions at all    congrats and good luck  keep doing the work   Initally he didn't and his drinking problem persisted because I conspired in essence with him  He would start back toward saying it was under control etc and I would go along because I didn't want to rock the boat  I realized we both needed it out in the open so we couldn't ignore it anymore  Huh  maybe I'll give that a shot  I did already kill an aloe plant though  so I'm not optimistic   I kept it on hold as well  but have been easing myself back into drinking  I started going out and getting beers again a few weeks back  But I'd never gotten hammered  But it's whatever works for the individual  Best of luck to both of you  these wins are pretty rad  I am at the same point  I will be making a new years resolution to stop drinking   If I can't hold back by my own willpower then I will seek outside help   The best of luck to you   and I said I would finish the corn    I got the day off  Just sitting here morning beer  waiting for the GF to get off work  Actually a pretty great day for me                 Holiday's didn't even really go that incredibly bad  I mean x mas always sucks  but we did the morning with the GF's family and her son  which was actually pretty fun  Like  it is a kid's holiday  Watching him open all the cool shit we bought him was super fun  Ity wasn't until the afternoon  when we had to go do my family  that shit got awful  Ugggggh  Being sober and making a big deal out of a fucking meal  Kill me now  But hey  at least we can have long conversations about which roads connect to which and how much different this town looked 20 years ago  you know the most banal of all conversations  Oh  ya  of course we can  Great  Where were we on the "Kill Me Now" part  I need a status update pronto               But  like you said  it's all over now  and I'm back on my normal drunk schedule  so cheers  I definitely don't have the smoked out throat  but my hangovers have been pretty bad  I'm in my 30's  32 to be exact  and I'm told they start getting pretty rough around this age though  so I'm not shocked  haha  But I definitely don't wake up feeling like I swallowed a bunch of broken glass  Jesus thats a mammoth drop  How are you holding up  Good contribution   I needed not to be a party to the awful secret  I needed support  Stick with it   I'm a guy tired of embarrassing myself in front of friends and family  tired of waking up without being able to remember huge chunks of evenings  tired of experiencing panic inducing hangovers and the list goes on and on   I know if I have one glass of wine I will feel cheated if i can't finish the bottle   I don't like the person that I have become and that is why I will not be drinking with you today    Thats really sad  condolences to your GF and family  It is really scary as Thats not far off where I am  Built it up over 15 years from just drinking at weekends to adding a extra day either side  to every single day  Kidding myself that its not that bad cause usually just beer I drink  so its not real alcohol and wouldn't do that much harm  Appreciate the message and support  just what I needed today  Now three drinks in  I agree 1000     I'm soft when I first wake up  Now I'm loaded for bear    Where is Bear  January 1st                     4 years   many thanks to the subscribers here  you have helped immensely   Thank you    We have  sign me up Also I think at the time if goven the option he wouldn't have told anyone but I basically was at the end of my rope and I was like either you get serious or I gotta get serious about my next steps   You are doing it right  Yeah  it is painful to uncover the wreckage of our past  But as has already been pointed out  that is necessary to get to the 5th step  Then you can do 6 and 7  And you will feel better until you get to the next hard part with 8 and 9    Remember when you admitted that your life was unmanageable  Well  now you have a better idea of what that means  Remember that you just looked into all those dark spots with honesty  You felt all those feelings that came up  AND YOU DIDN'T DRINK OR USE     I repeat  you are doing it right   Early on  I kept myself occupied by gaming  reading  watching TV  and going for walks when I had the energy  Later on  I got more active  joined a gym  and took up cycling  I switched to sparkling water to satisfy the habit  steering my urges over to that instead  I will not drink today I know the feeling  My parents raised us in AA and alanon   They are both 30  years sober   I understand that some people find it effective  it's just not for me  I've only attended a handful of meetings  but I find the environment very depressing  Every one has their own way of dealing with alcohol  and the "admitting you're powerless" thing has always turned me off  Here's to not drinking today  friend  I'm giving it a go as well  Today I will not drink with you all  Understanding where you're at and how you got there gives you the opportunity to change where you're going   That was one of the huge benefits things I learned from the 4th and 5th steps   I had to forgive myself for what I'd previously done to myself and my life   There was nothing I could do to change the past   I could only change the present so that the future would be different   Holding onto the negative feelings associated with my past was only getting in the way of me becoming the better person I wanted to be   What you're feeling is right in line from what I felt   As others have suggested  get on that 5th step ASAP   The relief you'll feel afterwards is enormous  I'm not drinking today  Sorry you had to see that  I witnessed a fatal motorcycle accident when I was a teenager  I will never ride a motorcycle because of it  I agree with many of your points here  I also hate the cliche that "alcohol is cunning  baffling and powerful"  Um  no  it's a substance  One that disagrees with me  is all  I go to refuge recovery meetings  and I find them much more upbeat  The nice thing is that it is a group for any type of addiction issue people are dealing with  and let's face it  most people have an addiction or attachment to something  or someone   If you like the meeting sober people aspect of AA  RR might be a good alternative  Well done and nice post   Out of curiosity  did you stop the weed    Did it help at all   Though I have not had any in over 30 years I have considered it    I relate to much in your post and really hope I can make a year and beyond   Thanks for posting    I'm on Android  and use an app called pocketcasts  You can find them on iTunes if you're on iphone  There's a lot of recovery podcasts out there  but I've only tried out Recovery Elevator  The format and tone Paul the host has really resonates with me    He releases one per week  and has close to a hundred episodes right now  so there's plenty to listen to in order to keep you occupied   Plus  it's 100  free  I'd have to say if someone went back on the street casue of Kratom it wasn't the Kratom  They have a lot bigger issues  No one is going to steal or sell all their shit including themselves for some kratom it just doesn't happen     I can be cynical or grateful   This has been my biggest lesson I have learned since starting my sobriety   Thanks for sharing it makes a difference     The SUV he t boned was on the side of the road   This is one of the most common multi vehicle accidents for motorcycles   The oncoming car doesn't see the bike coming or assumes the bike is far enough away going slow enough and makes a left turn in front of the rider     "Look twice for motorcycles"   "Ride like you're invisible"  Welcome to the party  pal   The only appropriate response to the Fear is to drink it into submission   Sign me up please  It's a happy New Year  Welcome  Glad you're here  you're not alone  Let's do this sobriety thing together then  See my reply to u dartaga for the podcast details   Still in this  Hard to believe I would make it through the holidays and keep my number going  I feel like I leveled up making it through the holidays and sticking to the change I've been determined to stick to  Closing in on 30 days  Not drinking today  feeling like I am king of my castle  Hold my LaCroix  Im going in  Not drinking today  Went to yoga this morning and I have counseling this afternoon  Going to get some cleaning and quality me time inbetween   I thought getting sober would solve my problems  Then I learned that  I was the problem  Drugs and alcohol were the solution  Take away the solution  and I'm left with myself which is not too comfortable  That being said I stuck with it and learned how to live with new sober self one day at a time  I was able to grow into myself and conquer these problems that I tried to fix with booze  FOR ME  AA taught me how to live   Woke up fresh this morning alcohol free I will not drink today  Are you drinking Nyquil  Because you might as well be doing shots of Jaegermeister if so  I definitely wouldn't call this sobriety  for myself  I continue to smoke cigarettes  so I understand the trading of one addiction clinging to another addiction thing  believe me  But smoking has never made me black out or drive impaired  so for now it's continuing as a crutch  albeit one I'd love to ditch  Best wishes  Happy 100  And great job OP  Sorry  but I also won't be drinking with you today   Tomorrow will be a better day because of it      probably because that's how my dr pronounced it when he pitched it to me   You FUCKING POSEUR    OMG S   What a FUCKING LOSER   Hang in there  man  Almost every one of us have horrible stories that stem from drinking  and everyone I've come across here has been nothing but supportive and kind  Try not to get too down on yourself  friend  Every sober day from now on will get a little better  I won't drink with you today I would say that is not good  but I am no expert   The last time I did cough syrup was in 1993  and I remember getting really fucked up on it     You've got this    Keep that liver happy    Ah  Just very negative  Sorry for being a dip  Going to try and be a bit more active in here this year  Was a big help to me when I initially got clean  Hopefully I can help someone a little  But it will mainly be waffling and rambling  Ha   After been lovely and quiet over the holidays today the gym was heaving with newbies  Hopefully some at least stick around longer than 2 weeks   My sciatica has been playing up today  can't wait to get my scan and a referral onto the pain clinic  Hopefully the cortisone spinal injection will sort me out  I have been on  100mg Gabapentin 3x a day for about a 6 weeks now  Im uncomfortable uping the dose any higher even though I'm on the minimum dose  And i obviously refuse opiates and benzos as a long term pain management strategy  So hopefully the cortisone injection can get me off these meds  Surgery is absolutely the last resort  for many reasons   Took my lad out to the park  It was really frosty so he was saying "look daddy  Jack Frost has been " I told him that in the summer Jack Frost is so busy making ice cream there is no frost  He also learned why we don't jump with both feet onto iced over puddles  Haha  Hes tough though  straight back up and exploring the icy puddle again  Just with one foot this time   Other than that back on a good clean diet and looking forward what 2017 brings         I'd toss it or give it away  I think it'll just make stopping again harder  Just me though you do you I will not take drink today Thank you    Thank you   Thank you   Ya  for sure  Lem  My girl  Smokey be calamari salty this morning  It's just another shit post  god damn  Haha                Takes a thing to get me that riled up  I tell those I sponsor to not try to quit smoking while quittting drinking or drugs  I'm 18 months sober and still smoke  It's my opinion that quitting smoking at the same time as quitting drinking can just make you feel worse  and I have used cigarettes as a crutch to get through the hard days many many times  But I've heard it's easier to quit smoking when quitting drugs and alcohol  so it's up to you  As far as getting rid of The alcohol in your house  that's probably a good idea Glad your hanging in there  You do know it's inevitable that if you continue using that one day whatever you do for work will no longer be an option  Better stop now before that happens    Does the post work pin and nod infront of TV really satisfy  Or just numb  When I was in that position it just numbed  I had no emotions at all  never mind satisfaction  Grey day  5 minute rush  numb  Rinse repeat  Thanks  I really appreciate it    Personally  I do not think I can quit smoking at the same time   I am on Day 2  but still smoking   Smoking does go hand and hand with drinking for me for the most part though   When I drink  easily smoke a ton     When I am not drinking during the week  etc a pack can last me 3 4 days   Best of luck  Really what the fuck could he say  He has no sources or anything anyone to back up his claims   Thanks for this post Mouse  I had a 90 day stretch of sobriety last year along with many stop   starts afterwards  I'm ready to embrace an alcohol free life  looking back to last year when I was not drinking made me realize that I was SO MUCH HAPPIER  Here's to one day at a time  Exactly   I am reading this through tears at work  I don't feel alone in this knowing there are people who have also weathered their way through this  These past few days I have felt like a person who is giving up  who isn't strong enough or doesn't care enough  and who is doing something wrong  Thank you for reminding me I am not   Alright  today I am not drinking  Join me in facing life sober for another day  OK  Timbf  you gotta give me the short version  what the fuck are you guys talking about   Happy New Year   Hope you have a good walk and it can give you some more clarity on this journey we are on   Made it through a pretty tough night last night where I could have drank while playing Pokemon moon and watching Cowboy Bebop but I didn't and I feel great this morning   And I can actually remember what I was doing in Pokemon and how Cowboy Bebop ended  pretty happy about that even if the ending wasn't a happy one  Hey   Great job starting your first step in recognizing and desiring to overcome an addiction   That's fantastic   As the wife of a porn addict  I recommend not making your GF your accountability partner right now   I would ask a close friend to help you through these early steps   It may hurt your GF  and it's possible that telling her will only relieve you of guilt  while leaving her hurt   This isn't very beneficial for one slip   There's a cool program called ever acvountabile for u bucks a month where it sends reports of all your activity to an accountability partner   Realize that porn addiction is often a coping strategy for stress and depression and a lot of other things in life that's negative   It might be helpful to talk to a cognitive behavioral therapy counselor or addiction counselor about your porn addiction  so that they can help you develope positive and beneficial coping strategies to replace porn  Some great suggestions are on here in threads about doing positive activities instead of PMO   Like working out  doing a new hobby  meditating  tai chi  mindfulness  yoga  etc  Please don't get trapped in guilt   You're a human being struggling with addiction  and you were pulled back into it and slipped  but you can begin again  now and do better   It's a wierd balamce to not be so hard on yourself that you are emotional distressed  and use the familiar coping strategy of porn  yet don't be so easy on yourself that you let the addiction lie to you and tell you it's okay to slip again   Just remember  your next slip could be your last  and you could go into a full blown relapse   But don't beat yourself up over it   Sorry if that's unclear or confusing  but I hope this helps  Stay strong   You're still going in the right direction  Fine  I ADMIT IT      I've never shot dope    I've also never drank alcohol and I'm a virgin  The hospital doesn't know me on a first name basis and I have no idea what county jail is like because I've never done anything illegal or bad ever  I just wanna seem hardcore        Hahaha oh I know  Cant wait till  Fash drops in  Fuck the poor schmuck didnt realize who he was trying to BULLY   Like I told him time and again walk away  But no go   Nothing worse than a angry  insecure drunk  I feel the same way   Day 2 and everything seems a little clearer    it's nice to have some positives happen so soon  Right on  That's too bad  What's your new plan  So many good things in this post that I saved it  I was talking about expectations just yesterday  In years past  I always wanted a NYE party that played out like a feel good movie  always wanted a partner to be this way or that  always wanted my efforts to be rewarded exactly the way I envisioned they "should"  and if those things didn't happen  well  then everything was ruined and I was depressed about it  Or some variation of that  How much better life is without expectation  I realized with a new clarity  yesterday that a huge part of being truly present and mindful involves living without expectation  accepting things as they are  Expectations extinguish the opportunity to truly know who I am taking to and truly take in the present  And alcohol exacerbated that   Thank you for sharing your story and insights  You gave me a lot to think about today as well as inspiration and encouragement   I will not drink today Sorry to hear this man but you've got to face the music  Day one is today  Get help  re wire your mindset and get some help  It won be easy and will last the rest of your life but is worth it  Post here and post often  Good luck to ya   Switch to hard drugs   Hahaha you joke   I swear to God I keep expecting him to say "PUNKED"  got ya  u lemarchand put me up to it   But S hes not joking  Sigh  Holy Fuck   Add own pity statement      Thank you for sharing  It sounds like you have a handle on it this time around  I love the idea of printing out your post as a reminder  I don't have a tattoo  but maybe a little wine glass with a big red X through it on my wrist wouldn't be a bad idea as a reminder for when I am tempted  Ha ha  I wonder if anyone has something like that   Maybe have two parts of the tag  longest streak and current streak  That way you have a concrete goal to work towards if you're having trouble starting  to beat your last streak    and if you have a long streak you can still push to get it higher   Nice job  Happy to help  This group is amazing  I've come to so many of the same realizations because of it   3 You will be ok  You're taking all the right steps     This is the hardest part  realizing you have a problem and then taking that first step into Soberland  But you're strong and you can do it  We all believe in you   Don't do too much at once  For example  I am trying to quit drinking but I also really want to lose weight  But I am not putting myself through dieting right now  No way  I have consumed a root beer float every day since I quit drinking  I go through jelly beans and gummy candy and chocolate like it's my job  It's best not to try an conquer too much at once  imo    I won't drink with you today   He doesn't know who he's messing with    Y'all got  r o on lock  but I've been on CA for 6 years    I have a pretty low tolerance for the bullshit by now    Something something die in a fire  Lolol   Thank you   I'm proud of you guys  idk really  Purely anecdotally   when I quit multiplayer games  I noticed that I was starting to enjoy simple things like reading before bed much more  after only a few days or so  Thank you  You'll get there     I realised recently even although I dont drink from the minute my eyes open  I am thinking about it usually to convince myself I won't drink that evening  which changes throughout the day to "i will just have a couple" then depending on how day pans out will result in a 12 pack   I completely identify with this  I've recently realized that I'm now obsessing over  not  drinking   so I'm still thinking about it all the time  and eventually I'd like to actually be totally present   but it's a less destructive and consuming obsession   Add me please   Here's to turning over a new leaf in 2017  I'll eventually post more detailed stuff here  but so far reading through what other people are dealing with has given me great perspective on the situation   Thank you  Here's to your next sober year  Great advice    Yesterday I was in the grocery store  While everyone else appeared to by buying kale and bananas  I was buying chips  gum  sunflower seeds  hot cocoa mix    The concept of relapse is so hazy it doesn't matter  What is important is that you want to steer clear from triggers because it helps you abstain  A radical approach is needed when quitting compulsive behavior  Consider two things  1  The number of days does not mean much in the context of recovery and 2  If you really do everything you can to abstain  it no longer matters what consitutes a relapse  For me gaming is simply something I won't do  and while a relapse is still probable  if I work as much as possible to abstain  the only thing I need to know is that I've radically cut out every ounce of gaming from my life  Absolutely  You have a chance every day to wake up and choose to be better  Maybe this all happened so you could come to this realization  If I hadn't hit my own rock bottom  I certainly never would have quit  As much as it hurt every time I did  I wouldn't change it for anything because it helped me heal and grow  I'm sure later you'll feel the same way   Thank you for responding  it's good to know someone is out there  I do feel pretty alone right now and drinking to blot out boredom and loneliness has always been a problem for me  The anger was just over the top though  Like  jfc have the sense to admit when you're wrong     Wow  Thank you for sharing that   My drinking too was attached to a lot of what I thought I was entitled to a me just saying "fuck it  this makes me happy"  It made me miserable   Congrats on a year    Not sure I totally understand  but I'm definitely sure that the 'old self real me' is exactly what I've been trying to escape  Kratom isn't my first rodeo  I'm 38 now and I've decided I'm not willing to go thru life anymore changing myself because I don't feel like I'm good enough the way I am    I'm about to go back to school to finally work in the medical field  lifelong dream   I wanna pursue my dreams  ya know  Being numbed up on something just makes me stagnant  I wanna feel good because I'm progressing and out there living life   not because I ingested something that gives me a false sense of well being  It's hard  cuz I've been an alcoholic addict on and off for the past 26 years   since I was 12  That's a lot of sitting out on life failing myself and others to shoulder  I have had long term sobriety  the longest being 6 years  Then I got that little voice that said 'u don't need meetings you're fine ' I gave in  Then the next voice was 'u can have a little ' And eventually I gave into that too  I'm really enjoying the 12 step meetings  Those people have gone thru the same feelings and wasted their lives like I have  and it's inspiring to see that they've come back  Makes me think I can make peace with it too  And   if I can see this through  there will be people I meet who are in this same situation and I will be able to give them hope  THAT makes me feel good   Yes  it would be stupid to start smoking again   You are very bored and that is your go to activity   It's only been 1 5 months   My guess is that you may also be scared of what it means to get un bored  getting a job  saving some money  etc   I don't believe getting other drugs for depression is going to help when you're not addressing what's making you depressed   You're bored out of your mind   get un bored  Turtle  I lost my first boyfriend  as an ex  also   We had been broken up for about a year  but we were both still young when his accident happened   That was 10 years ago   This past year without drinking showed me I never fully allowed myself to feel this tragedy and go through the emotions   wth the help of my awesome therapist  I worked through a ton of stuff   The emotions are good     Now we can finally feel without shrouding our feelings with booze  Hello  I'm also one of those new years resolutions suckers  Not my first time trying though  I quit drinking last new years eve and made it 180 days before relapsing on a vacation   During that 180 days I lost 40 pounds and felt incredible  My work ethic improved and my business is now thriving as a result    When I came back from that vacation the vacation didn't end and I've undone almost everything I'd achieved over that 180 day period  I'm now starting off this year behind on work  struggling to catch up  and have re gained all 40 pounds of the weight I'd lost    I commend everyone for making the change but implore you all to stay strong  Every day gets better and better but one slip up can undo it all   This time around I've got some support  I've started attending meetings and will be more active with this sub reddit  this is my first post   I'm confident this year I won't be setting that badge back to zero   Fuck the zero    I will not drink with you today   Yeah  Mom is still visiting so all I hear is how good things were 20 30 50 years ago  I'm actually looking forward getting back to work  I was in the same boat this year   It culminated in a felony dwi and my kids being taken away from me   Will take about a year to get them back    When I drank  I was in this never ending cycle of drunk too high over to drink  It was so dark and so depressing     Through outpatient treatment  aa meetings and therapy  I feel like a different person   And it's only been a few months  I went to my first aa meeting the day the day after I got out of jail   It was the first time in years that I had finally found a little bit of hope   Wasn't much  but enough to keep me sober those first few days  And it just grew from there   I am still going through the court mess and that will be awhile before it is done   But it is so much easier to handle sober   Good luck and if you need anything  please post   there are so many people here to help     EDIT  have you tried calling your local AA intergroup   They usually have a hotline and some will even come to your house to talk to you    Not drinking today  no matter what  The dumb fuck doesnt even know that this is Fash's post thread  From back when it started   Its like Please shut the fuck up and go away  You are CLEARLY not wanted here   But his kind never learn  They lash out and swear till they get their way  But they dont understand its not their way its just the adults have wasted enough time on  the children  So sad really  I agree with all the comments already here  drinking alcohol can be a way to deal with stress  and if I get into a pattern of dealing with life's problems this way then I don't use the tools that I need to when dealing with them  I also don't learn any new ones  When i quit drinking I was a mess  I was full of fear  anger  guilt and incredibly selfish and I had given up my ONLY tool for dealing with stress  I don't know if someone who has never been addicted to anything can appreciate this but it is hell  My answer was not just to quit drinking but as others have said  to deal with my living problems as well or I would have exploded from anger and stress or started drinking again  Like I said looms    can I call you that  better than first name or letter  let  me know  Hes the  type who never admit they are wrong  He made a homophobic comment last night that he deleted  Fucking coward  I called him out on it  So whats he do PM's me with BS and deletes the evidence  instead of manning up Great member eh  Ahhh  Got mL confused with mg  And I'm a science major  Haha  Withdrawals make me dumb  I downvoted my own comment  But in 30 mL of liquid Immodium there are only 4mg of Loperamide which is what I've been taking  If I could moderate  I wouldn't be here   I tried everything to smoke in moderation  but it's just not possible for me on my own   If I have my way  I smoke all day everyday   Unless I am physically unable to smoke  I do not possess the ability to moderate   The difference between "normal" smokers and drinkers  and those with substance abuse problems  is just that   The obsession and compulsion to smoke and drink   I read an article once  top ten signs you are an alcoholic  number 1 is   you read articles called top ten signs     Long story short  in my experience  if you are here  and having a problem  odds are not good that you can moderate   Maybe you can  if you figure it out  let us know  but this sub is really for people who want to quit  not slow down I wasted yesterday and don't want to feel that way again    I am excited with you and certainly won't be drinking with you    When I was a teenager I wasnt comfortable with a therapist   I was almost in the exact same situation as you  alcoholic mom  supportive dad  My dad was the one who convinced me to go and it was the best decision for me at that time    Right now you have a tremendous amount of stress out upon you  You need to think proactively and consider not just how you feel at this moment but how you'll feel in a few years  You also might want to seek out an Al Anon Teen group  You can look them up online and it would put you in a group of your peers who are in the same situation    You sound like a responsible kid  Keep your chin up and remember you are only responsible for yourself not her  I did that too   That is part of the reason aa was so helpful for me   Not only did it keep me from drinking  but I made friends too    May I ask how you quit  Cold turkey  patch etc  I'm thinking of doing the same   You're freakin awesome  Thanks for being inspiring and telling it like it is and being a leader   Fantastic   "You are a gentleman and a scholar"    I've never read Carr's book  but it sounds interesting   Another book of note is "This Naked Mind" by Annie Grace  NICE JOB   HIGH FIVES    Checking in  I feel embarrassed to write this as it's only day two of the challenge  but accountability is important so here goes  I woke up this morning and was browsing through Instagram  bad habit   when I stumbled across a page full of scantily clad models  It wasn't porn and I didn't explicitly seek it out  but I still felt myself starting to get aroused by pixels on a screen  which is not good  Although I left the page pretty quickly and wasn't really tempted to act out  it's still a definite red flag that I need to pay attention to   Especially since I've had issues with triggering content on Instagram in the past  as I'm sure many of us have   Since I use it to help promote my business  I don't want to uninstall Instagram if I can avoid it  But I definitely need to set some boundries as to how I use it  and hold myself to them  And if this sort of thing happens again  Instagram is gone  simple as that  Because my recovery is more important than any stupid social media platform  Anyway  rant over  Have a great week everyone  Great  I'm normally a good writer but when I write here  it's always dry and confused  I reread myself and think "fuck it  I can't do better" and hit submit   Your writing is really good  there's something in the way you wrote things that people wrote a million times before  You made it sound good and funny and appealing  Kudos for the Louis CK reference  my favorite comedian who say things we all feel in a completely honest  brutal and funny way  I know we're not here to talk about writing style but I wanted to point that out   I think my problem with writing here is that I want to say too much and I end up repeating  just as I'm doing right now    Good writing and happy to see you fought your struggles  I will not drink today  I feel like I had three freebie days because I was busy on vacation with friends  Today  which is only the second day of the year  is where it gets tough  Alone time is not good for me   But so far I'm restraining  Very nice   Congratulations and thanks for your posts and insight  I have heard exercise helps with anxiety  maybe try doing a few push ups or sit ups  Sorry wish I had better advise  Weed was causing my anxiety  it's not fun     Just wanted to say I am in the same boat as you  my husband is a daily toker and isn't quitting  I know it will make things harder  But I feel stronger and more resolved knowing I can stop even when it's so accessible  It's a harder road but will be more rewarding in the end       Yeah I understand  I need an actual number as my goal of days  A detox in a sense I guess  I somehow managed to get in the habit of drinking literally every single night for the last 4 months  I dunno what happened but I know I need to break that habit  Sign me up  Kid  props to you for managing to not only blend in with one addict sub  but mod one as well    It takes effort    I mean you don't know shit about shit  but you went far  Yay    Good for you  how exciting  I didn't buy enough yarn at first either    now I have too much ahahah  But I just started cross stitching sooooo hahaha on to the next craft   D And I agree  these crafts are SO cathartic and help with my anxiety so much  I'm tapering so I don't have serious RLS right now  But I am experiencing its cousin   the obnoxious achy legs  RLS was a huge PITA in my past opiate detoxes  I tried quite a few things  I think the clonidine works best for me   the supplements and stuff didn't seem to work  but I don't know if it woulda been even worse without em  ya know    Yesterday  my legs were really getting to me  I forced myself to do the treadclimber and it seemed to help significantly  I didn't even do that much  cuz I just did a big Kratom drop and it's soooo hard to exercise  I mean  GEEZ  Lol    Caffeine does make my legs worse  but I still drink it  When I've done c t and had the massive anxiety  I absolutely could not have any caffeine  Like a sip would send me into a crazy panic  burning skin  etc    In the past  RLS and aching legs were my worst and longest lasting symptoms and drove me nuts  Tapering down on the Kratom and getting the leg thing back really scared me  I thought this was not an opiate  It was like caffeine  Oh well  Point is that it goes away eventually   Yeah  at the end of the day if you love multiplayer games  then it's your life and you should go for whatever you like    But for me  I still prefer not going back into competitive mode and playing for a better rank 10 hours a day since I lack self control to stop after 1 game  Watching shows on Netflix can be paused  there's no special skin or achievement that I am able to unlock and it feels way more causal to me than a Dota match  For me it's a lot about the addiction that's made me stop  I  too  am confused  Sign me up please   I am excited with you     Let's do this  I needed the face to face support of AA to stop  In my area there are tons of great meetings  with awesome people who are eager to help out and teach me how to stay sober   Online helps too  but I wouldn't be here without face to face human connection  You can do this  Hell yeah  man  Glad you are here  I relapsed so many times after going to an AA meeting  because I kept thinking  "I'm nowhere near as bad as that guy " I too had to listen to the similarities  and not the differences  and now I really enjoy going to certain meetings  Glad you don't have to dig any deeper  Those things  not losing a job  etc     are called the "yets " I haven't lost my job   Yet  I haven't been arrested   Yet  I haven't gotten a DUI  even though I drove drunk a million times    yet   Welcome back on the wagon   I will not drink with you today    I took a lot of short naps  drank a lot of club soda  took short walks  read non stop on SD  and told myself that it was okay to feel like crap taking it as a sign of just how addicted I was   I'd read enough to know that the physical withdrawal eventually subsides bit by bit  3 7 days for me    Lastly  I chose to see my discomfort at the dues I was happy to pay in exchange for leaving my drinking days behind   It's undoubtedly the hardest thing I've done in a very long time  but quite possibly the best as well   Good luck   You can do this  Nice  keep it up   You should be "normal" by tomorrow  though we forget normal means having emotions and stuff  I have had a look and theres one in my area tomorrow and Wednesday  neither seem to have childcare but on Wednesday kids at their dads which is a dangerous time for me so I am going to make sure I go and until then keep my mind occupied on here and other useful sites people suggested  Thanks for encouragement  same back to you   Buddy there is no SHORT  version  Check my profile and Fash's and see noob call Fash a twat a cunt and many others  And the shit he said about me  Holy Fuck Tuna  I was in the EXACT same boat one month ago  It only took a week before I was back to daily  After about 2 wks of daily use  I was worse than before and developing all sorts of terrible health issues  My thyroid has swelled and I feel like total shit  Today is Day 1 of CT and I reaaaallly hope I learned my lesson this time  If people like us could moderate their usage  we would have done it a long time ago  Even after this last go around  I still can't seem to get idea in my head that I need to totally let go and dump my stash  I worry about an eventual ban and that I'll "never be able to get it again"  I want to have a stash around for "rainy days" in the future  years down the road  but I just don't know if I can  should  It's so easy to get on a slippery slope even just using once  If you are like me and can't seem to toss your stash  I would suggest getting a time lock safe  I've started using one and it works but sometimes I wonder if I'm not just needlessly torturing myself  One thing is for sure though  if I have bags just sitting around not locked up  there is no way I have the self control to quit   Thanks man   I'm trying very hard   The worst part is  my family thinks there's something horribly wrong with me  since I never work our go out    I think the hardest part is getting out of bed in the morning   Ughhhh this is the most difficult thing I've ever done  but I threw away my kratom  and I'm fully committed to this   One day at a time  Where are you originally from  I've heard that Switzerland is one of the hardest countries in the world to move into   Got it thanks  And yes lets  I want to change so badly  I think these things are a "blessing in disguise" to make us grateful to be sober  You'll be ok  not drinking with you today   Terrible advice  He claimes Fash and I are poser Junkies and we dont know WTF we are talking about  Like Junkies are a grwat lifestyle eh Tuna It really worked out stellar   And apparently they have my shoes   I just have to go trade them for the slippers  Yeah I figured there was no certain answer to this  It probably varies between people too  I guess I'll just have to wait and find out  I hear you  I guess it's all about that thing I'm no good at  moderation  Great thoughts   Thanks for that  Awesome   Keep checking in here   As you can see  lots of info  support   success here on SD  Has resulted in my longest sobriety run ever   Most importantly  It is not killing me  though the first few days were challenging   Won't be drinking with you today  Thank you  I'm with you all the way   I have almost zero motivation as well   But I'm convinced there's light at the end of the tunnel   Hang in there  buddy  Good on you  Sounds like you're off to a great start already    We are still WAITING on that apology  Thats all you gotta do in CA  Make it easy bud  I've taken Adderall off and on since childhood  I'm a total addict  but oddly enough  I never abused it  It didn't tickle my brain correctly or something  I remember having some after I quit morphine and a couple weeks into detox I tried it cuz I was sooo sluggish  Somehow  it gave me anxiety but no energy  Definitely did not help and I didn't do it again    The crippling fatigue seems insurmountable  The only thing that has ever helped me is exercising  But I laugh when I read people advising exercise to people who just did a c t detox  How is it even possible  I remember 'exercising' to me meant a lap down the hall and back  Then I worked up to two  three  etc  it helped a lot tho   Lol  that kid has been playing everyone    You can try this at home  you don't need to be a junkie     Get a big spoon    Try dissolving shit in it    Salt  sugar  powdered sugar  baking soda  it doesn't matter     Waste your drugs here if you want to     We add heat because it aids this process     Every junkie knows this    They're frauds if they don't get this    You quickly notice your dope not dissolving    Only someone who has never done it before would claim otherwise    But don't believe me  try it out     I appreciate you like them  I did too  but they're full of shit    http   i imgur com 3A5eTzV jpg      look at all that not dissolving    Nobody who actually does this garbage is so stupid as to think you don't heat this up    They're fakes  "this guy can no longer choose to make today a better day" What an amazing  sobering  and empowering statement  Congrats for making the right choice  I know it is hard  and there will be tough days coming  but remember that YOU are tough  Tougher than the cravings  Tougher than the excuses  You are GOING TO MAKE IT  Keep checking in here when you feel the urge  Read others stories  See that you are not alone  We support you  Soon  you will be in a position to help others that are at the same point as you are today  Good luck  my friend   Not the only one  Thank who shall not be named for this  Do I need to pull up your PMs again  chief  It has been extreme lately   Kids must be on break from school  This is good advice  I'd recommend joining a starter course of something you'd like to do and talk to people there  I personally found climbing and dancing worked really well for this  especially climbing   Do it for your own enjoyment and just to get out there and be around people    I have seen people who were sober for 18 years go back out   The reason one particular person admitted to was that they stopped working on their sobriety  I am here  it is the new year   I believe the phrase is  bring it on  Thanks for this  as a newbie its really good to have people who've gone through it reinforce that even if it's not easy  it's worth it  Quit porn   Keep masturbating as long as it's not creating problems   If it is  cut back or you can just have sex only and not masturbate  It's really a personal preference about masturbation   Personally  i was a frequent masturbator and it affected my motivation and mood negatively   If this happens to you  you may want to adjust to less or none   It just depends on your preference    Porn is damaging on so many levels to both men and women  and damaging to relationships   Educate yourself on this  and you will see it has far more problems and negatives than positives   Google "negative impact of porn" and "porn brain changes"    Good luck young man   You're very astute to be asking these questions at such a young age   Props  Same  I don't want to have another year tainted by drug use  I was getting there last year  but this is my chance to build a new life for myself  and to keep drugs  and alcohol  away from it so that I can make something truly good out life    You can do this  I think  u dd4y's suggestion of making a proper action plan is a really good idea  I think I'm gonna have a go at doing that too   Keep us updated  Let's do this thayng I'm hanging in there  Trying to be satisfied with the progress I've made and not so laser focused on the end result  I'm just about functioning  Perfect way to describe it  This may take me three months  but who cares  I already feel way different and my hair quit falling out and my skin cleared up  I feel cleaner   I'm sorry  I've been in an obsessive place like this and I remember it well  It helps me in times like that to try and not be so hard on myself    the obsession is humiliating  particularly in how others interact with it  It's a powerful set of feelings  but it's only a set of feelings  a condition that will pass  Obsession is a burden I carry  and when I'm ready to set it down  I'll set it down   Amen  I heartily concur with your assessment that leaving alcohol behind is job  1 in these early days   I made the mistake of taking on too much at the same time I was trying to embrace sobriety   It set me up for disappointment and a number of relapses in 2016   What's different this time around is keeping my focus on not drinking  and taking small bites on the other things in my life   Also  I have a support system this time around  SD and a counselor   Great advice  Lol what  Homophobic comment    And yes calling me that is fine  most people have figured out who I am  Preferably don't add the y though because it's too easy to search for that   Thank you  24 hours in and already pulling my hair out  Just eyed up a bottle of wine downstairs for about 5 minutes  but I'm standing strong  Fuck this shit  I ain't doing it anymore  This group seems awesome  Thanks again man  That's awesome  Your skin looks great   Thats my greatest fear  losing the kids  and I can feel it getting closer with each day I drink  What I've realised is Im already losing them as I prefer to spend my evenings drinking rather than sitting with them  or if I read to my son I will have a beer on the bedside table  Its a awful existence  Well done for turning your life around and for taking the time to offer me support with all you are going through yourself   Life Ring is a group that I go to and have been pretty happy with   I go to AA groups and I get some of the things you are saying   The biggest positive takeaway from AA is hearing the other stories and gaining strength in my own recovery from that   The most difficult in staying sober for me is the feeling of isolation through the process  wow  ya  that seems extra ridiculous  Like  what  Who would try to be a poser about junk  What does that get you   Got my first DUI at age 31 38 days ago  notice badge    The first 2 3 days I thought my life was over  complete hell   Blew a  25 and drove away after a side swiped another vehicle  got charged with that too     Luckily I didn't kill or injure anyone   After those few days  I decided I refuse to let alcohol ruin my life anymore  I came on this sub right away and mostly just read  I stated going to AA and a counselor and couldn't be more at peace with my life rt now   Both of those were life changers for me    Even with all the legal shit  I have more hope  faith and positivity in my life than I ever had   We can all have new life if we choose too   You are 24  you can move on  it'll be ok   Keep your head up  it only gets better I promise   Best of luck   I tried AA once and found nothing in it for me  That was my individual experience    I thought I would never find a way out of the drinking cycle until I came across the book  The 30 Day Sobriety Solution   I talk a lot about that book on this sub  but I do not have any affiliation with it   other than it may have saved my life when willpower  AA  and self loathing couldn't   Amazing post   Thank you for the story   the inspiration   and the laughs    welcome Love this  Congratulations  Now I have paper cuts    From what I've heard TNM is a more modern  actionable and user friendly version of Carr's book  I have read TNM twice but have yet to read Carr's  I will  eventually  but for now I'm just going on what I've heard   Congrats on the clean time  man  That's great to hear   How you feeling    I find mindfulness pretty difficult to get into  but I'm gonna give it another proper shot  And maybe get into a Martial Art in the coming months   I've always wanted to  but I've just realized  if I can throw away so much time on acquiring  taking  and recovering from drugs  I can sure as hell make time for a new hobby that's gonna help me better myself   Best of luck  And welcome welcome      Take one thing at a time   Congratulations   A hell of an accomplishment    As someone who First Nations I take GREAT OFFENSE to that slur  Fuck man Gays  now  First Nations people  Fuck you  Right  I mean  I know I shouldn't complain  My family is pretty cool  but damn  these conversations are just so fucking boring  And it is so hard to put the mask on and pretend I'm a real person              I can do it  like  at work and shit  but at work I am getting paid  If you want me to pretend to be functional  you need to pay me  is my philosophy   Yeah   People offer me a beer and I decline   I don't like drinking "a beer"   My mind doesn't work that way  I had never heard of "wet brain" before surprisingly  That is not just scary but terrifying  Right up there with ALS  Wow    Another reason I am glad I quit  Not today Damn  that sucks  But you've been hear long enough to know we get ass hats sometimes  Just brush it off  you know that both you and Fash are loved  Wouldn't worry about some random idiot  When you have broken that trust  it's difficult to regain that trust and they were most likely using that as a tool to do so  Although  OP should do research  instant drug tests are  not 100  accurate  I have failed several for no reason  then proved clean by lab testing  Congrats on 1 year   Looks like you have made progress on many real life achievements over that year  Keep up the good work brother  ding ding ding  And dont forget the 3 5 hours on site everyday Fash and I do   Just because you know we wanna be cool  good luck i'm on day 2 also    Hell  you're lucky  That's about what I spent from the middle of November to New Years Day last year  Had my head buried so far in the sand I would ignore how much I was spending  Good on you for recognizing this   Posts like yours help me since it makes me think about how bad I was just over 9 short months ago   I was a miserable drunk and pill addict who often considered suicide   Help for me was a stint in rehab  then an intensive outpatient program and an AA meeting each and every day   There are people that care for you and want to see you get better   Please keep reading and posting here so we can see how you are doing  Take it easy at the gym  Don't exacerbate your cold         Day 6 is better than Day  1  All the physical shit will be dwindling down  Take notice of the symptoms that are going away    I always produced an ungodly amount of spit when detoxing  Fuck that sucked so bad    All the weird anxiety is totally normal  this you know   It's a new year  New start  Good stuff  Xo The guilt and shame can be crippling at first  They were for me  I completely understand how you're feeling  but don't let them win  I promise after you detox for a bit and find sobriety  you will start to see the beauty of it and your guilt and shame will be much more manageable  I am SO incredibly sorry you're feeling this way  I go to therapy and AA when I need to  and I strongly suggest you do the same  Without therapy  I don't know how I would have managed my guilt and shame  Wishing you all the best in your journey to sobriety   3  Hey there 2017  Didn't drink to celebrate  Not drinking today  Intend not to drink in the future  Good luck everyone  Edit to correct autocorrect   It's gonna get better  It's not always easy to stay away from it  but each time you win against that voice or that part of you that's craving for speed and trying to lure you into using  you feel so much stronger  You can do this    You can find a better way to live that doesn't lead to you feeling like total crap every few days after crashing   sign me up please  Lets do this  Totally appropriate  I tried NA beer when I was in my I can cut down on booze phase  I didn't really like it   Now it would be too close to the real thing  if I'm gonna drink I want to get fucked up  not just reminded of it   I do miss beer with yard work  house cleaning  and rainy days but those occasions called for specific beers and NA beer won't do    If I was at a bar and needed to hold and drink something I'd probably go with soda water but if I drank an NA beer I would not be upset with myself or reset my sobriety app    If it works as a crutch go for it  if it is just a stepping stone back to boozing it's probably a bad idea  I would never flush weed down the toilet cuz im against wasting stuff but that really shows you are determined to quit  GL  also running is really good  gives you nice natural high if you do it long enough  it is an awesome feeling  especially when you just wake up  dress up and go for a run followed by a cup of coffee  it is amazing start of a day Yesterday homophobe  Now this morning Racist  As a First Nation's person he seems to get great joy in calling me Chief  Like I told him  That is also a slur  Not drinking alcohol today  no matter what I am faced with    You're right  I thought of that later after posting  I just need to stay strong enough to always come to the conclusion that I'm making the right choice to stay sober  I have GAD  PTSD  and ADHD     I COMPLETELY understand what you mean in regards to these illnesses fostering addiction  It's funny because I leaned on alcohol so much for help with all of those things  but i am able to manage them and deal with them so much better without it     I feel like you just realized the same thing   Oh well  I guess there's just no easy way out of this craphole  Thanks   When I was a little younger than you I once was too drunk to get in a car that was driven by a drunk driver who crashed the car  injuring everyone inside  That was 25  years ago  One of the guys still today walks with a limp and needs a cane  That didn't deter me from drinking and driving  Nor did my own DUI about 3 years ago  I can only thank God that I never killed myself or someone else in all that time    In some ways  you've been given a gift   an opportunity for self reflection at a young age  and although I'm very sorry for the circumstance under which you got it  it's not a waste if you realize it as such and use it to grow    Good luck   Yes words to live by thank you  How would you respond with repeated attacks bud  I have never attack him    So tell me what to do   True  Its hard to separate numbness from satisfaction sometimes i guess  Glad i took my sub  Work is canceled today and def would be wanting to b nodding at home instead gonna try to go actually do something  Hey thanks and sorry for the late reply I was busy yesterday  So you're around like 20ish days  Everybody's different but you're through the worst of it and on the right track  For me the difference between day 10 and 20 was HUGE and so was the difference between 20 and 30  If you're not already noticing big positives you should soon  My appetite and sleep were pretty much back to normal by a month  Best advice I can give you is "time" as stupid as it sounds  I didn't realize how much kratom was changing me until I spent an entire month away from it  before now the longest I quit was 15 days since I started taking kratom  So basically I never gave my body and mind a chance to recover and I thought life sucked and I needed kratom when in reality I was addicted and needed to get away from it to be normal again  My goal at first was just to make it to a month and I decided to not even risk trying it again once because I feel so much better    edit  also its normal for a month to feel like a year when you go through it at first  haha  also see my comment above if you think about using "just once"  No worries   One of my kids still won't talk to me so that is tough   But right now  there is nothing I can do about it so no use stressing out about it   The best thing someone told me in the very early days was to 'keep my head where my ass is '  Don't worry about yesterday or tomorrow   Worry about right now   And to remind myself to stay in the present when I feel my mind wandering   It was a great piece of advice because I didn't have to worry about what was going to happen   I just had to worry about now   And take care of things I could control   like not drinking    Its hard to say  'I'm never drinking again' and feel a sense of accomplishment because never just doesn't come   For me  it's much easier to say 'I am not going to have a drink today' and actually succeed    When I have a craving or stress  I bring it down to an hour  or even five minutes   And tell myself I am not going to drink for the next 5 minutes   That much I can handle   Go for it    I'm rooting for you  today  Good advice from JonnYellowSnow  the chemicals in your brain need time away for them to balance out  You have probably missed out on a lot of things in the real world with family and friends  Try to catch up with those people and get to know them again  I know when I played heavily I just wanted the short version of every story from everyone  so I could get back to gaming  And even paying attention to the short stories I felt like I was faking interest in them  Look man  you have had shitty AA meetings  that doesn't mean AA is shitty   I'm gonna use an analogy a sponsor gave me when I told him I hated AA meetings   "Chicken fried steak  every diner and truck stop in the country has chicken fried steak  some make it really well  some use shitty meat or the gravy sucks or its over peppered  but some places its absolutely amazing   Now if this is your favorite thing to eat  you will try it everywhere you go  but when you are near home you know the places that have a good version  and you know the places that fuck it up   Why the fuck do you keep going to the places that fuck it up "  The message was  try new meetings  find different ones  and when you find one whose message really resonates with you  keep going to that one   It took me a long time to find the right meetings  but I am a regular fixture at those now  This is why I don't take to AA  AA says "surrender yourself to a higher power"  quit alcohol and good stuff follows   Know what  I used alcohol to avoid succeeding  to stay passive  AA is just more "stay passive" stuff   Happy it works for some  But it doesn't work for me or many others  I quiet exactly one month ago  for the 3 times    now I hope is forever  The stupid thing that make me smoke again is to try again to see how is to smoke one cig  dont try that  just don't do it  U will have craving for ONE CIG  please listen  don't  Also maybe u will start to feel tiered  anxiety and so on  but it will pass sooner or later  In your case like mine too much years of heave smoking  it will take a while to detox all that crap from cigs to feel like a non smoker  Stay strong and don't try that one cig  So far it's been over a week now with no kratom   Haven't worked in what seems like forever   I'm a server at a very busy restaurant  so there's absolutely zero chance of me being able to keep up    so I keep calling off work  Also  my family is worried sick about me   I wake up with overwhelming back pain and anxiety every day so far   My palms are sweaty constantly   Throughout the day  the fatigue waxes and wanes   My legs feel like rubber bands   It's hard to do anything except lay in bed and watch Netflix   Any rigorous activity wears me out rapidly   Hell  even talking too much wears me out   Prior to quitting  I was drinking a shit ton of powdered Maeng Da every day  several times a day   It got so bad that I actually started feeling dysphoric and detached from the world    I thought I had pneumonia or something   Nope   Once I realized that kratom was ruining my life I threw it all away and haven't looked back   I've experienced withdrawls from opiates and benzos  but none of that even comes close to what I'm experiencing now   I'm fucking  incapacatated     All the kind messages and comments on here are what keeps me going   You're all in my thoughts   I'm gonna keep on fighting until the day sobriety embraces me  Sounds like a great time   I love the Mountain Goats and that song   "No Children" is another one that I love  not as a celebration of the self destruction but kind of a catharsis   Thanks homie that's great to hear  You too when I was sufficiently horrified I stopped drinking  went to detox  went to outpatient  went to AA   Don't drink  make a plan  follow it with action  Repeat    you never ever have to have this morning again  I came on here to post this very thought  Well put  You can stop talking now  it's okay  The people at my clinic pronounce them     Suboxone     sahboxun      Methadone     methuhdone     I imagine its a combination of where you are in the world country  how the people around you commonly pronounce it  and how the person you initially heard say it  pronounced it   I pronounce "data" like   daytuh   instead of   dahtah   because I watched Star Trek growing up and my parents are Trekkies  for example   That might be a bad example  Nice  Vegan can be super fun  I've done it before and am thinking about it again  At first everything taste like you spooned it out of a diaper but your palette will change and you wI'll love it  I'm not drinking either after many many years of blackout drunk every night for years  20 fucking years    This group has helped me far more than AA    but AA was VERY helpful for the first few months  After that  I just logged in here daily and that has helped so much  I totally understand what you mean  I'm not too into AA because of the religious aspect and because it honestly does feel a little "culty" sometimes   Also  my sponsor situation didn't end up working out and was kind of weird     Whatever works for you  you should do     I keep AA in my back pocket for emergencies  and I know it's always there should I need it   I can see the recovery model working for someone else as well because it's leads less to an all or nothing thinking but for myself  I always end up relapsing and bingeing really badly every time  Getting an extra counter badge could really be helpful for those whom the abstinence model doesn't work  Homie I can guarantee you you don't wanna be just like me     lol but thanks  Haven't been doing too bad with the cravings lately but coming here definitely helps to remind me of what I was dealing with just a month and a half ago   You can do it man its hard and you might not do it the first time but if you really want it you can get back everything kratom steals from you Oooooh the suspense     Thank you    Congrats  man   Don't ever give in to that voice in your head   Get rid of all your drugs and move on   Going to the gym is a great idea   I have a gym membership but I feel too shitty to go  Thank you so much  I just went through the worst heartburn of my life last night  I had like 4 dose of peptom bismol and it barely worked  Im gonna stop taking the medication today but what should i do to combat this anxiety   Not to me  I think cold turkey is the only way  The withdrawals suck  but they do eventually ease up  You are poisoning yourself  You have to stop the behaviors that are making you smoke  You are tough  Tough enough to survive the withdrawals  The first week will be tough  Then the second week will be easier  And so on and so on  Today makes 18 days for me  I am feeling so much better than when I started  I don't want to sound harsh  but Man Up  You enjoyed the ride getting here  and now it's time to pay the bill  Quitting isn't easy  But it is doable  You have to be strong  Stronger than your desire to smoke again  We are here for you  Stay strong and you will see that  Woo hoo    That's amazing  Can I ask for any tips or tricks that helped you stop  Sorry to question in on your glory post  congratulations on not smoking and as someone who doesn't know you but knows the struggle dearly     I am so proud of you   What worked for me was goto as many different meetings around your area as possible until you find one your comfortable in  just because they are sober doesn't mean they are good people  I also try to goto one "men only" meeting a week  People tend to be more honest around their own gender  The last year I've been really into the Dharma Punx Refuge Recovery program which is meditation and Buddhist based for those of us whose higher power is ourselves  so instead of looking up  I now look within  I hope you find what works   Oh  I dunno  I say "Chief" a lot  too  I never even thought about Native Americans  To me  it's the same thing as saying "Boss"  I would obviously never say that to someone of Native American lineage  but on line  ya  I just say it as a thing  Maybe I should stop  didn't realize it was offensive              Are you actually a Native American  I never realized that  Huh  learn something new everyday  Way to go  You are one day closer to your new life     I've always marveled at the paradox of how things that are good for you make you feel like shit and things that are killing you make you feel awesome   This is so true  But there's a flip side to that  the more you do things that are good for you  the better you'll feel  The more you do things that are no good for you  the more you'll feel like shit  Based on past experiences quitting even if i'm past the wd's "just once" even if it truly is just once like ive done before  tends to set me back tremendously  I'm not one of those AA NA people who believes in abstinence from everything i'm just abstaining from kratom because of the way it affected me  Thanks and happy new year to you too     Do you have a bible in your home to fuck   I understand the feeling like you've thrown away a lot  but believe u foobarbazblarg  You're  barely  beginning  I'm thirty five  and the distance I've come professionally  even carrying this burden of addiction  is stunning  I look forward to the next ten years without this addiction with eager anticipation  Congrats on quitting  The brain knows how to get its fix  so giving up all gaming is the only way to do it IMO  My addiction to gaming easily transferred from game to game  It started on SC2  then Diablo 3  then Hearthstone  then Overwatch  then back to Diablo 3  It isn't as simple as quitting one game  as they all bio hack a part of our brain that is meant to reward us for completing achievements in the real world  Gabapentin used with Clonidine works quite well Lol I'm native too    Wtf   We have no control over our past  only what we choose to do in this moment   Choosing not to drink is the single best  hardest  thing I have done in a very long time   At only 29 days in  I'm beginning to feel a positive overall change in myself   It's been very much worth having faced my fears  I counted on SD for my support and got a counselor to help me process things   It helped me to let my family know that I was aiming to put alcohol behind me and let them know from time to time how things were going  Stay strong  It is always one day at a time  The people here are on your side  Keep it up   You're real friends will still be there for you   3 This has been my experience  Anyone else who doesn't want to be around you because you're sober doesn't deserve to be  Do this for you  who cares what anyone else thinks   Keep up the good work   Proud of you  dude   I feel exactly the same way as you  absolutely terrified of going back to work   Never surrender  never give up    you ARE turning a corner and everything is gonna be ok  I think this is just generally life for most people  its not rosey  its not sunshine all the time   Its hard to replace smoking weed with another hobby because smoking weed is a hobby in itself   Weed will always be a fall back for most people to rely on   I can't count the amount of times I've hunkered down with a sack of weed for a few days to let something blow over in my life   I never fully quit because I don't see a reason to do so   I take massive breaks to let my body normalize again and get into another routine   but I always hit a point where its like 'i want to smoke some weed'  and I just do it  because there's no wrong or right way to live   you just need to listen to your body at the end of the day and not ignore your personal responsibilities  Thanks I appreciate the support here    I just ignore it  when I'm sober ish  I have indulged in some flame wars when I'm hammered  But you will regret those more the next morning  cause  what the fuck  Did I just spend my whole night arguing with an idiot on line  What have I done with my life   or at least that's how I feel                 Think you'll feel better tomorrow if you just take another drink and forget about it  That's my advice   That's true too  I'm trying to keep that in perspective  What does "I'm a donut" mean    And you've got this  Not drinking today  My bottles do typically have warnings    Not specifically about WD though   "Recently  I had too many benders  far too frequently  and the consequences aftermath of them all just built up    My wakeup call was being found barely conscious  choking on my own vomit  laying underneath my mothers car at 3am on New Years Day  An uber driver had to ring my mum's doorbell to alert her that there was a lady collapsed outside her house   Also  Work is a fucking mare and a half  Dealing with these absolute pillocks " I attended AA meetings for about a month or two  but it was ultimately not the right kind of support for me  You are definitely not alone  SD has really been my major source of support  but part of my sobriety also meant taking better care of my mental health  so I've also seen a therapist and a psychiatrist over the last few years for assistance  Listen to this  it's more of a mental thing after three days but mannnnnn  If you do the "I'll just smoke one cig thing" you'll relapse every time  I have two or three times  I'm 25 and have been highly advised to stop smoking now to save throat and mouth  I know that should be enough to never look at a cig again but it's hard  I'm still young and somewhat stubborn with smoking     Thank you for the advice  I'm in a good place now but realise there could be a stressful day where I think one won't hurt  I don't want to fall into that trap  You stay strong too  you can definitely kick this thing for good   I have been reading your posts over the last few weeks and am concerned for you  If AA is not an answer for you I hope you get the help you need  There are lots of options out there    Please take good care of yourself  Welcome  Today is my day 2  I think a lot of us are starting  or starting over  with this New Year's milestone  I will not drink with you today   Martial arts is a great idea  I'm definitely going to give it a try too    I find being very conscious about causes and effects to be super helpful  I need it to remember why I do it    Currently eating and cooking and working a lot  Still can't sleep or control my emotions  Cried throughout Xmen last night  I mean really  We don't know what the future holds and what experiences will happen to us  No one can say for sure they are done forever with something  That is why addiction recovery teaches us to take it one day at a time  Everyday I tell myself "I don't know if I will never play another video game  but I know I'm not going to play today "  Checking in   I'm not in a city I'm in an unicorperated township and the people in charge devided they wanted everything to be miles away from the houses because they assume everyone is rich enough to have a car and if they aren't fuck them  theres no buses and its to far for me to ride my bike  this isn't the type of place where doctors come to you and its to late to sign uo for oboma care which is probably getting revoked when trump goes into office  I know people are just trying to help I'm not trying to find excuses its just easier said than done  Same  We will get through this  Its 1pm in the afternoon bud  What do you want me to do     The fact hes across the pond argueing at 12am or something shows how angry he is   And Tuna honestly  Do we want a racist  homophobic bigot here    Come on man  This is yours mine Fash's Lem's etc    Like Fuck we are having ONE angry drunk chase US away   Fuck that Tuna I'm an empath as well  I found that alcohol made the stress and emotions of others weigh even more heavily on my mind  Now I am able to process my and other people's feeling much easier and without as much anxiety  Wishing you all the best  Sober on  It's not a relapse exactly  but I would also say it doesn't really align with quitting  This is the easiest time I've had quitting and it's because I gave up all game related content  Every other time I would still watch streams and it would never end well   This is my goal hope plan for this upcoming December  But for now  I'm just focusing on January  Feel you  it's not a habit just something I had access too  I can relate  Lost a close to 6 figure job due to coke  I've no college degree either so starting over will be hard  Im going on 3 months clean and I'm starting over with my ex wife who had been very supportive    Luckily I've had long term sobriety so I know what to do but it's been hard  The depression was brutal but I've managed to string some days together  Stick with it     I know  And so is Ilovemyself and many many others  Ffs You don't have to label yourself as anything in order to benefit from not drinking  Many of us find the word a helpful tool to reinforce the fact that alcohol will invariably have negative consequences for us  Others find the word offensive to themselves but also choose to not partake   Whatever you choose  best wishes for a sober 2017  You may find the fine group over at r stopdrinking may help you in your journey  He trades time with you for alcohol  And he knows it  Dear  u HipstaMomma   It's been a few months   A   How are things lately   B   Do you have a  safety plan  http   www domesticviolence org personalized safety plan     Note that getting a restraining order is sometimes a bad idea   It sometimes makes the guy angrier   C   Does each and every one of your kids know how to dial 9 1 1  and have they memorized the number   D   Have you ever been to an Al Anon meeting     I don't work because of health issues  E   Are you signed up for welfare and or Social Security disability payments  14g a week  2 g a day at a rate of 8 12 joints a day  That is a joint with 0 25g  Skimperzzz   I will not drink today  I got sleeping pills for the first nights without kratom   Was from my doctor  5 pills in all  three taken whole and then four halves filled by valerian tablet   This last time quitting from about 15 20 a day with the above method I didn't suffer any RLS  I will not drink today  This subReddit is a great place to start   I also went to AA meetings which were very positive experiences   I was astounded to see just how many types of people had the same problems with drink that I did   Lastly  a therapist to help work through some of my other life issues has been a great help to get at some of the underlying factors in my drinking   Good luck   I will cheerfully not drink with you today notimeforwine  one thing my psychiatrist has me do is when i eat i set a timer to wait as long as i can  sometimes it's a few sometimes it's minutes but its progress    another thing that triggers me to puke is when i feel stuffed  so sometimes i eat half of my food then wait to see how i feel and if i want the other half in an hour or so so i don't feel stuffed  or if it's like on the holidays i chose small amounts of things i like so i didn't over eat anything    another thing i do is try to stay on a normal eating schedule and kinda eat the same healthy food on a daily basis  this helps me to know i'm not eating too much calories  if i eat rich food like cheese or something i tend to puke bc of fear of the calories  but at home i eat a lot of eggs  oatmeal  healthy choices so i'm feeding myself nutritionally and not eating a lot of calories  this helps me not puke bc i'm being healthy  choosing healthy food helps me a lot     i want to eat healthy and not high calorie   the holidays were really really hard and i puked a lot     but i'm starting over today with my normal food  i didn't bring holiday food home w me despite people saying "oh take some of this with you" bc i knew it would trigger me    trying to wait is really helpful too   also   this is a difficult disease and i strongly suggest getting psychiatric help   I agree  buddy  I wasn't trynna argue for him  I hate racists and homophobic assholes as well  buddy  You ain't gotta convince me  All I was trynna say was kick him and be done  You don't need to engage  Cause that's what he wants              But ya  he has no place here  GTFO  I'm on your side  mans   Hi  quick question  Quoting this phrase   The past  almost  3 years have been pretty tough in terms of getting up and doing anything     Did quitting gaming solve this problem  If yes  did you quit 100  and are you still abstaining from it       If no  what else did solve this problem  Thanks in advance    It just prolongs the withdrawals and keeps you thinking about weed Jogs long walks  Congrats to you   I forgot about sleep   The hot bloated nights with a full  sloshing belly   Yep forgot about those nights and don't miss them at all   Not drinking with you today  Thank you  Just woken up feeling pretty darn good too  so hopefully whatever that phase was  it's over  We can do it  you're right   I will not drink today    I'm not in a city I'm in an unincorporated township and the people in charge devided they wanted everything to be miles away from the houses because they assume everyone is rich enough to have a car  Oh       its too far for me to ride my bike  Fast biking is a skill   The more you ride  the faster you get   What's the most number of miles you've ever ridden in one day   Also  what are your thoughts on hitchhiking with female drivers    Edit   Many people in America own Walmart grade bikes with under inflated tires   These aren't ideal for fast biking  but they'll do in a pinch   "Humiliating" is such a strong  but accurate word  It is humiliating to keep talking complaining about something and know that everyone is thinking "just break up with her and be done with it " It's humiliating to get so optimistic and be talking about how well she's doing   only to have to tell people she's relapsed  again  It's humiliating to keep saying "I know no one wants to hear this again   " then keep talking about it       A friend suggested I do 90 in 90  and I think I'm going to  I need a sponsor   someone I can talk to without feeling that humiliation or guilt   I can't wait to go weeks without thinking about it  Fantastic post  Congrats on your year and thanks for taking the time to  grab the microphone  and write this all up for us  When the clouds finally break you're going to feel so good   Hang in there  This was great  thanks   I can't count the number of times I convinced myself to stay using the phrase "I'm not ready to give up yet"  Finally  4 months out I realize that my moving on wasn't "giving up" at all   I guess I could compare it to trying to make it rain during a drought  not stopping for fear of giving up  when in reality  nothing I would or could do would cause that rain     Sounds like he's not ready to stop   because he's not doing it   Addiction is a disease of regression and one that takes a lot of soul searching and self work  which is why it is highly recommended that recovering addicts don't date in their first year of recovery    Again  I'm not you  so what worked for me won't necessarily work for you  but here's what I did   I set a boundary of our not living together while he went to rehab and got sober   I said that if he worked his program  became healthy  and saw a therapist for his depression  we could re evaluate in 6 12 months   We could be friends in the meantime   I wouldn't date   not for him  but because I was still in love with him   I told him  and myself  that if he was committed to getting better  he would understand and appreciate the ability to be responsible for himself and work on himself outside of me   He got mad  as I could have predicted  as I had been enabling his addiction and wouldn't do that anymore   During rehab he lashed out a few times  not wanting to take responsibility for the hurt he had caused  but rather continue his pattern of blaming me   I finally had to tell him we needed to go no contact while he was in rehab because my boundary was that I would no longer tolerate his blaming me nor his emotional abuse   4 weeks later he was out and singing a different tune  "I'm so sorry  I want to work on us  none of this was your fault  I want to give you what you deserve "  Thankfully I realized this was him trying to tell me what I desperately wanted to hear in the hopes that I would let him move back in and enable his drinking  So  I thanked him for what he said  but continued with my 6 12 month timeline   I do believe that he loved me  and though being told I'm loved is wonderful  I had already realized in our years together that being told that he loved me amidst his highly destructive drinking didn't actually feel very loving after all   He relapsed   Not because of me  because of him   I don't get to own that   And I can't tell you how grateful I am that I also am not around to experience the destruction that comes with his drinking   I wish the best for him  but have gone back to no contact   I was disintegrating in that relationship and I refused to do that any longer  Thank you  It real does help seeing others in the same boat  Oh man  worse than benzo w d  Holy hell  that scares me a lot   We're in it together Frankie  If you ever need a push I'm here  We got this  I have been a donut several times  I know how great I feel when I have been sober for a few months and then for some stupid reason I blow it again and have to start over  Thankfully Today I am not drinking along with you  Yea I never abused adderall either    just took what I was prescribed every day  What really pisses me off is I had no idea the stuff was even addictive  Call me oblivious but I just assumed a Dr wouldn't put you on something knowing that you'd become insanely addicted to it and that it would take a year of hell to recover from  Fuck Dr's and fuck big pharma  It's the biggest scam that's ever been played on the human race  Either way I consider myself lucky to have beaten the odds and able to start fresh with the knowledge I now have    I'm 40 days free of all mind altering substances and damn proud of myself  The only thing I have left to kick is this shit I've been putting in my lip for the past 15yrs  Snuff is up next on the list    Honestly  I can't recommend that book enough   I got it for several friends who aren't necessarily dealing with addicted loved ones  but even just strong personalities   It was life changing for me  Thanks bro  we got this  I just had my first "time to buy weed" impulsive thought  Gotta get out of that mindset Tuna talk to Sdk and Mae We all reported him  Maybe with someone with your time served will help   To be honest bud   WHAT MORE DO THE MODS WANT FFS   The best of luck to you too  I ended up having quite strange brain fogs from time to time  when I had much hectic at work  So strange that I thought   this must be a psychosis  Thank God I am away from Kratom   Good luck on your way to freedom     Wow  Thank you for sharing this so honestly  It's a lesson for me  just starting out  I hope things are so much better for you now  I will not drink with you today   I saw that shit  Pissed me off   Why would you shoot Xanax  It goes in your mouth and shit   Between 16 and 17 was when my pornuse got out of control  I dont know if its because something happened there that turned it into an addiction or whether I was just unlucky  But you should really quit now  Between 16 and 20 is the time where most people start having their first relationship have sex for the first time  so it would be a good plan to go into a relationship with a clean head so that you can enjoy it to the fullest wouldnt it  That last paragraph   Im going to do this  I tend to set myself up for a fail by expecting to much and trying to change everything at once  Take it minutes hours days at a time is a much more realistic approach  And so far I have managed 11 hours from waking up so its a start  That is so impressive    congratulations  You're a great inspiration to me  Do you even remember how it was being drunk   Well I had an epic NYE   Started drinking about 4   Walked to the tavern about 10   partied my ass off   danced   maybe broke a table or shelf or something with glass as I have a nasty cut on my ass   Spent all day yesterday cuddled in bed with a bottle of vodka which I finished at 3am this morning   Took down Xmas decorations this morning and am making a huge pot of homemade creamy chicken wild rice soup for my sick parents   Being a good daughter today with no drinking   Just a lovely haze of Xanax and weed   Now I'm going to return the slippers I wore home yesterday morning in my drunken stupor and see if I can find out the pieces of NYE that I don't remember  That was a big catalyst for me quitting  health related anxiety   It's one thing to be mindful of our health and potential issues but another to spin off into a panic attack about random symptoms and minor aches pains   At my worst early in 2016  I actually got myself so worked up on a couple of occasions that I threw up  Christmas Day being one of them   super       The good news is this has gotten soooo much better for me since I quit  I find that I rarely have issues with severe anxiety and not really any issues with the "irrational" anxiety I was feeling before when I was drinking   Now I worry about things and have anxious moments but I can talk myself down with reason and logic   I hope you're able to realize these same benefits from quitting regarding your anxiety  but for sure your body will be better off   Also  the internet is the devil when it comes to researching health symptoms  I generally avoid it at all costs   Maybe a check up with a doctor could help alleviate your concerns   Best of luck  I will not drink with you today  I could always tell when I was having a bad day when my NOMO last checkin was less than a day ago      I made a post a little while back stating just about the same things as your first paragraph  Hang in there  For me when I started craving I told myself A  That's just the part of my brain that associates stress with using and it's not how I truly feel AND B  I was more depressed using than I am clean anyway   Happy One Year  Bad    Yay o Yay for you    AA is not for everyone  but I believe you won't no until you give it an honest shot   It sounds like you have  and I applaud you for that   AA works in my life  at this point  so I continue to go   Keep working at sobriety and you will succeed    Thank you  Congrats on 61 days  It's great to hear you're doing better with anxiety since quitting  I can't wait  Again  because their daily reality might be denied in some respect  going to alateen meetings will allow them to be around people who are living similarly and will instantly validate them  Sign me up I've been having dreams like that too  It's shameful but it is definitely wonderful to wake up still on the sober streak Good luck  What a awesome New Years resolution   Thank you  I realize I don't have to be too hard on myself  But if I don't workout or run  I have a way more empty feeling in the evening and the cravings get harder  For me personally  the natural high I get from running helps me feel better in the difficult evenings that I usually spend drinking    You are doing so well  thats some achievement  I can't wait to have been sober that long  Ive been drunk or high  for more of my life than I have been sober  thats a scary thought and I know I have a long fight ahead  I am going to call my doctors surgery in the morning and ask for help  Thank you and keep up the good work  well done  Saw it for the first time when I was 12  a friend showed it to me  Started watching 3 or 4 month before I turned 14 not sure anymore  And noticed it was a problem when I turned 18  but I didnt do anything about it until recently  I wish I started quitting earlier  maybe I would be at 90 days then by now  I don't go to AA for many of the reasons you outlined  though I do know there are a lot of atheists on here that do find it helpful  if not a crucial part of their sobriety  Personally  though  I won't be a part of something that requires that I declare myself powerless in any way  develop some 'higher power' analog so I can follow along  and label myself  I attended one meeting at the height of my boozing  and that was enough for me  That's why I mentioned Smart Recovery first      Also at the height of my boozing  I got a taste of sobriety while in India for a couple of months  The before after photos were shocking  I looked like a completely different person  in a good way  of course  when I got back to the States  I was also calmer and somehow more confident than I had been in a long time  I think it was a combination of seeing abject poverty nearly every day and sobriety that made all the little things  like people's opinions of me  that I worried about before seem absolutely silly   I've read on here many times that people thought they would be perceived as or be boring without alcohol  but instead find that they and others are boring with alcohol  I think there's something to that  My SO has had beers every night since I quit  and I'm starting to see the sudden good mood and silliness for the sad  flimsy bandage that it is  It doesn't make my SO more interesting or fun to be around    Some of what you have been writing reminds me of drinking culture in South Korea  There are a few documentaries on it on YouTube  I imagine many young Koreans do seemingly get a lot out of drinking  social bonds are strengthened sometimes  and undoubtedly broken just as many times  and it's an escape from the everyday life  But at what cost  To me  one of the highest costs of drinking every day is losing out on the depth of thought and mindfulness I have when I'm not drinking  I miss out on being truly present  I miss out on being myself in favor of what my monkey brain tells me people want or I won't be accepted or loved  I missed out for many years   I can see where some might develop an addiction out of selfishness or social habit or what have you  I often wonder  though  if there's something deeper  even if only a smidgen deeper  What's wrong with saying that you developed a habit out of selfishness  What's wrong with saying exactly what you think  So what if the meeting is full of people who lost their wives  husbands  house  job  dog  the whole bit  and saying  "Well  everything's going splendidly for me  I'm just worried about my health"  The thing is  there may well be someone in there who at one time only had his or her health to worry about  Or maybe there will be someone like you right now going to some sort of meeting  I don't think meetings are the only way  I don't go to a meeting  I'm not sure it's for me  either  I'm considering it  Right now  just coming here is helping tremendously   Anyway  I'll stop before I write a novel  Thanks for making me think     Hope your evening goes well  Thanks for letting us know   I just checked it and it works on the web  might be a mobile issue   You can search NA beer in the SD search bar  too  that may take you to posts about it  Great Post  So true  Thanks for your reply man and I know what you mean  But imagine that you are a perfectionist with huge potential when you are young and meant to be great in life   Then you wasted the best years of your life due to depression and porn  I didn't enjoy a single day in my youth  Thus  it is very hard to achieve something at my full potential with an older age  no I don't have the motivation anymore like before  The burning desire that I had before is nonexistent now Adding to that some chronic diarrhea and illness from a surgery from a clueless doctor  Went snowboarding on  New York's Eve   My boots are shitty and made me miserable with pain numbness   so we left early   When we got down from the mountain   we went to the grocery store and didn't notice the tailgate was down until returning to the truck   Some shady looking young guys were clearly scoping us out in the store   so I think they might have stolen it   Either that or we didn't close the tailgate  TBH  I hope it was stolen because at least it's being used that way  would hate to think it is just lost to the world   Bought that thing used 11 years ago   It had a lot of sentimental value   Otherwise   no complaints     Chairs  Keep coming Checking In  Thank you for this post  And congratulations on your 958 days  that is inspiring     Deal with him how you like in your own sub  His heroin post here was deleted  What more do YOU want  I don't give a shit about your stupid junkie drama  Keep it out of this subreddit  I told him the same    And he has shut up  but here you are still stirring up shit  If this doesn't stop now you will get a temp ban    NO DRAMA IN CA  Take it elsewhere  this isn't the place for it  This post was kinda lame I guess  I just felt obliged to come clean with you all  you've been a great help to me even if you don't know this username  you have   Don't feel bad for me because I "lost my days"  I don't subscribe to that philosophy  it's about making changes   A person who is 1 week clean can be further along then someone who is 10 months clean  it's about a mental state and lifestyle in general  we're all different   It felt good to flush what was maybe 3 grams of weed down the toilet  but kind of a waste  that is like 70  pot down the drain   By I made the decision to not think about money in that regard  I got the entire baggy and that money I spent was to get high for two days  so what if it could have lasted me three more days  I didn't plan on smoking three more days   I just hoped I could have reached this place of equilibrium and put the nug of weed behind the star anis in the cupboard until I "needed it"  for real    If it makes you feel any better  I noticed a lot of significant benefits when I got to around 45 days   Less bloat  better skin  redness in my face and eyes was much better  emotional stability got better   so maybe you have some of that to look forward to   Either way  this is a marathon  and not a sprint  and I think we should all feel proud of ourselves for every day we don't drink   I have gotten a lot of satisfaction and sense of accomplishment from reaching fitness goals   Maybe you could set some non drinking milestones or goals to work toward based on your areas of interest   Complete a project related to a hobby or home organization improvement   Run a 5k or set a new weight lifting goal   Work up to 20 minutes a day of meditation   Although these types of things aren't specifically alcohol related  not drinking certainly helps us achieve them   Congrats on your 37 days  I will not drink with you today  Yay  I am glad to hear that your heartburn was completely gone after not drinking    My situation was getting so bad when I was trying to sleep that I would often sleep on my back with my head propped up with an extra pillow or two  It would hurt my neck but at least gravity would help keep the heartburn at bay  It's amazing looking back now and thinking how much effort I put in to being able to drink even though it left me miserable  To be honest I really think it was all about managing my anxiety  I was willing to deal with lots of unhealthy and miserable conditions just to be able to turn off anxiety and my brain like flipping a light switch  Drinking allowed for this to happen but with awful side effects  Now instead I use anti anxiety meds and make sure I am getting rest and I feel much better  What was your motivation for wanting to stop  It all depends on what you want out of this  I personally do it every couple days but I've been cutting back now  Slapping the ham isn't an issue in my opinion  guys have been doing it for years  I think nofap and even this subreddit can be kind of cult like at times  where guys are afraid to embrace their sexuality  Just do as you like  without the porn   Dude  I'm so there with u  I was given Klonopin as a second line anti epileptic after a brain injury  Nasty to get off  Was given Suboxone for pain after the same injury  cuz I'm an alcoholic and Suboxone was 'not addictive'   BS  That was so hard to get off  Given GABA after morphine w d and had to kick that too  Never had trouble kicking Adderall but I don't think I took enough or something  I'm not taking ANYTHING anymore and assuming it's fine because a doc said so   yeah all this time I thought I was playing it cool thinking my clothes didn't stink I was so wrong     Dunno how my girlfriend put up with my stinky self for so long   Congrats on quitting  I'm a little under 4 months free and boy what a difference it has made in my life already  Can't wait to regain full function of my lungs  Nice  One thing I've really enjoyed about not drinking so far is exploring fancy non alcoholic beverages  I never used to buy nice non alcoholic drinks  like sparkling juice or green juice or whatever  because I thought it was a waste of money  but when I compare the price to how much I used to spend on booze  it's NOTHING  and kind of nice to have something fun to drink in place of alcohol  Keep it up  Thank you so much for sharing  I'm glad you are back to sobriety  It's a good reminder to me that I am only one drink away from that all consuming madness  Warm wishes   Great  It really means a lot to me as well to know I inspired someone    Thank you for that   Journaling is great for lots of things  Ideally I would write out a few pages of my freeflow thoughts each morning but I've not made time for that lately   In my notes  I use Evernote mostly  I have a notebook called "YAY" where I added an entry for each time I had a positive achievement  exciting milestone  or something really awesome happened  And honestly most of my list in the original post is so ingrained in my day to day life that I just wrote it out from the top of my head  Thanks  Thanks  You are about a year ahead of me    I feel like the benefits just keep coming the longer I am sober  Have you seen things just keep getting better over time  I have NEVER Pm or DM you  Dont lie  Great progress  Keep going  You can do this  My experience is that I felt more and more in control as the days began to accumulate into weeks  Not cocky by any means  just have recent success to draw on whenever I have an urge to drink  Isn't it great to feel excitement about the future instead of despair  Not drinking with you today  I will not drink today   Awesome    Congratulations on Nine Sober Solar Circumnavigations  Way to go  I will not drink with you today  Personally  fantasizing is healthy for myself  If my fantasies were about porn then I would agree to avoid it all together  She was infatuated with the needle    Can't blame her really  I'll take IV Ativan over the pills any day   I've found this to be very true for me as well  although I don't even start out slow   I bummed one in the morning after almost 150 days without  and I had bought a pack by the end of the day  Addictions are NOT casual  Thanks  It was an fantastic year really  I had a lot of help from friends and colleagues  I think it's really great to have a group of trusted people to talk to especially as a person who works alone from home most of the day  Having a group where I could share my darkest days with really helped get me through  I've also been lucky to have overlap with my professional support group and sobriety support as two of them are sober too  One is in AA  Thanks  I met some of my best Sober Friends at meetings   I found meetings all over  and made lots of new buddies  Up all night  Blasting OPIvY and the neighbors don't like it  I turned it up  Waiting for the cops to come    Checking in   Yay  Congrats to you as well    Coffee Cheers   Side note  I've found that Ginger Beer at a bar is a really damn good alternative to beer beer  Take a look at Alateen   http   www al anon alateen org for alateen Loveee it  More nuanced than that  It seems to be fine after about a week and only once   Checking in   There you are  I won't drink today  Nice job man  Hope to join you   soon  Personally I think very quick taper is effective in reducing some of the initial symptoms  By this i mean 2 3 days max before quitting completely  Sounds a solid plan  Getting up  ready  washed and out even for a quick walk is something positive  What you thinking of doing with the day  We're not alone  We're all together in this   I share your heartache and pain   Glad you're here   I spoke to a counselor  she recommended meetings   I went and met lots of great people  got support  tools  resources and fellowship   They're always doing some sober activities     Tried any meetings  Yes   that's the secret  Seems so simple    but to our brains that are so powerful    we can easily get caught up in the past or the future which is all fantasy    what we have is this moment   "today" let's stack up a bunch of todays     thanks for reading replying to my post  Happy new year  I won't drink with you today   For me  the longer I have been sober the more my interests have changed and diverged from my friends who enjoy drinking a lot  So i find myself getting more out of life by doing the things that make me happy as opposed to hanging out with "fun" drunk people  Yeah then they get 1000 likes and act like it means something   Its fake attention  people   Then they have to do it all the time because the reward mechanism kicks in and their real friends get tired of their shit   Eventually they're just a lonely  dry middle age husk looking through their old Instagram photos longing for the glory days  Just quit again on the 31st  and it's been a while since I drove my car  I got in today and was instantly put off by how it REEKED like old ciggie butts  despite having cleaned out my ashtray before quitting    Time to do some cleaning      Wow  thank you so much for sharing your experience   I think stories like this should be archived in a "cautionary tales" or "scare me straight" thread like the Sunday Solutions and Saturday Shares   I can imagine this could have happened to me at some point  almost the same thing happened to my aunt after several years trying to quit   It cause her husband to leave her  but she went to rehab and finally quit drinking  and they have since reconciled   I'm so sorry you are still dealing with the physical impacts from your accident  but perhaps this will save you from more serious life threatening health issues that could be caused by drinking      Your story really helped me and I'm sure so many others here   This is what is so amazing about this sub  we can learn from each other so we don't have to repeat each other's mistakes   Congratulations on your 100 days  I will not drink with you today  High Five   Happy New year  So sad      About kratom     Indeed   Of course kratom is a reasonable less harmful replacement for opioid drugs or pills   But so are methadone and Suboxone   Yes  visiting a Sub doctor once every few months is a mild annoyance  but it's not that bad   If you eventually want to wean yourself off of kratom and get truly clean  see  r quittingkratom   By the way  dear OP   When you take lope  always read and follow the label   To do otherwise is very foolish        About the OP's spam link     About the OP's post   u funknut wrote below     It's spam  He probably doesn't even use Kratom  That URL he provided is a sales site  Report it as spam  please   I think kratom is useful  but that the OP here is not so useful   I have both downvoted and reported the OP        TL DR     Kratom is good  but if you can get Suboxone from a local pharmacy  this may be even better   I spoke to a counselor   She recommended meetings   I went and got support  tools  resources and fellowship   I've never looked back  Thanks  You aren't too far behind me  Congrats  I am glad I could help inspire others  Oh  demolishing my hand was a really sad event for me  Even the doctor had a little talk with me about it  When people ask me why I stopped drinking I usually list off a few of the top reasons  there are MANY  and it's 1  To save money and because my freelance business was failing  2  I broke my hand   Every time I make a fist I feel that broken bone just not being quite right  I feel the tendons all ache and feel tight  I was lucky that I got to a real local specialty medial facility that could give me advice on how to rehabilitate it  I also didn't have insurance at the time and that cost me a pretty penny  UGH  I don't consider it a relapse since I have not returned to the previous routine and behavior     for me  black and white thinking has resulted in going no more than 1 2 days without smoking  Turning it down is not my next step  mostly because I am in very few situations where I even need to worry about turning it down   MY next step is to start running exercising again more      I won't drink today    let's do this  One day at a time   Good stuff   keep going  For me it was really hard first two weeks with cravings  then I've been through a 'sad' patch and now I'm starting to feel really good   You are exactly right  Once I saw wtf I was doing to myself  my family  my bank account I was done  My health got shitty  What kind of person would I be if I continued on a train that I knew would crash    not much of one  IMO  Once we actually see it  feel it      it's so hard to really SEE it when your using  once that fire is lit  it's go time    You are gonna do fine  Adjust to your drops before you drop again  best advice I can give you  Keep a STEADY amount of Kratom in you during this taper  Makes it a whole lot less painful  You absolutely can do this  Get through the first 10 days of this taper and it will be doable  Again  big congratulations  Great   Waking up sober is awesome  and even better  is  going to sleep  sober  To start I ate a lot of spicy food and put nailpolish remover on my hands to make purging taste terrible and feel painful  The following heartburn made binging less likely    That was just until I got into DBT therapy    This is my first attempt at a streak ever  Back in November I put down the porn for the last time and haven't looked back  There are definitely some trying times  and I've had weak moments  but just visiting this subreddit whenever I feel the need to break has done wonders for me   Biggest advice I could give to someone struggling to keep a streak going is simple  Remember why you started   Great Post   Happy New Year Mouse   Totes  And drinking permeates the industry of coding design  I see this more and more especially now that I have a different perspective  It's very much a part of the culture  http   alistapart com column does our industry have a drinking problem So the always thinking about weed goes away  Glad you're here   I spoke to a counselor   She recommended meetings   I went and got immediate support  tools  resources and fellowship   I've never been happier  1 2 17  Checking in  clean  If you can get your hands on Chantix  do so  It works really well  and the side effects are overblown  The biggest thing is the emotional effects    you've got to find a way to "make yourself happy" in the absence of the chemical you're addicted to   Working out  even just a little will gets your endorphins going  Also  check out the app and book titled Super Better  It's not self help crap  but it does a lot of shifting your perspective towards taking on challenges and doing what you possibly can to reach a goal  Fuck doctors  They're no different than about 98  of the attorneys out there ripping vulnerable people off    in it for the money  Congrats on kicking all of that crap man  That's something to be proud of  Keep on keeping on     It sure is   I mostly drink pints of soda water when at a bar  It's usually cheap and often free  I will not drink with you today   Absolutely   The people here and at nofap especially act like its completely off limits to jack off when you need to   Porn is the problem   That is the thing that rewires your brain and screws up your sex life   Masturbating is normal and healthy if done in moderation   Don't listen to the confirmation bias idiots that think their life is changed because they haven't whacked it in a week  Death threats now  Wow  You are too much  Funny you say that  started lifting again last week and today is chest day  Eating hen gonna go up to my dads and lift  Fuck cigarettes  Right now working on playing music which i havent for a long time  Partly cause of living situation partly cause of me  Waiting to hear back from girl to see if she wants to go walk around somewhere and or help buddy at bike shop later n talk about maybe volunteering there once a week Ehh I'm no fan of AA for myself personally but deflecting the responsibility of a relapse onto the program is misguided  Own it  Delve into it  Learn why it happened  Think of ways to counter why it happened    Thoughts like yours are paving stones to relapse after relapse after relapse imo  Checking in   D One thing many people  including myself  ask when they are considering stopping drinking is how will they still have a social life  I really don't miss bars  Looking back I realize it's a huge waste of time just sitting there having quasi friendships with people that only have drinking in common  True that  I've only ever had this happen twice  but it felt very rewarding to know that it was not a conscious fault  Checking in  still on track   Look make this easy on yourself  You got a dozen peeps telling you were wrong  C mon  Even you must admit  defeat   We will be cool  Just an apology here in CA and opis  To Fash and I of course  Get it girl  Ive been picking for 14 years now and im pretty sure getting over old scars while trying  to deal with random new scabs is one of tne hardest things parts of the whole thing  Keep it up     So in typical drunk style I managed to hurt myself last Tuesday  Pulled most of the muscles in my back as well as some in my arms and my right leg   So I went into work that Thursday and I was crying by the end of the day  Doc told me not to work again until a follow up on Tuesday  Might do that if I still can't work on Thursday  Only pain at this point is a slight soreness in the muscles of my lower right back  nothing like the constant aching I had 4 days ago  It no longer brings tears to my eyes to bend over and lift something light   I mean it hurt to pick up my jacket    Never realized how heavy everything was before  There are many paths   There are many tools and methods   AA is not the  Universal Panacea    AA   is   probably the most prevalent  accessible  free group process available     I have POWER over the alcohol that is NOT inside me    That's why today I just forgo ONE drink   The First One Thank you   Despite smoking on New Year's Eve I still have no desire to go back to smoking all day every day  still will not be buying weed and still will be doing the best I can to avoid situations where people might be smoking    My goal is to not count the days but rather live moment to moment with awareness   So far not having a plan for quitting has worked out better for me than telling myself that I'm never smoking again   Like you said  to each their own   Happy new year    Good point   I'm pretty sure blood pressure meds and benzos come with warnings about abrupt discontinuation  Congrats  Very inspiring  Live and learn my friend   What's your plan from here on out  You can  just know the chances of turning back into a daily thing are high  Happened to me  I used for pain daily first  Quit  Then used 1 2 times a week for awhile  Eventually it turned back into daily use when life became stressful or had Fuck this moment and turned to kratom  Then I was physically dependent again and it's harder at that point to stop  But to be completely honest  once I'm done with my taper  I plan on using occasionally  But first I was to be completely clean for at least a month  then stick to once a week or 2 weeks  That's it  I prefer it over drinking and I still enjoy it a lot  Only you know if you can control your usage  Now that I've relapsed  I've learned I cant use it for stress  It must be a social fun only situation for me to use or it will spiral out of control  And who knows  maybe I'll relapse again     I would do something sort of similar   I loved getting drunk and watching things that made me "happy cry"    Like when my favorite sports teams won championships    I would sit there and drink and search Youtube for clips of them winning  and it would make me cry   That release of tears was something I just LOVED       Thank you for your comment   I completely agree that setbacks can turn into excuses  which is why I'm trying to live in total awareness    I think highlighting the progress instead of the setback results in greater positive mentality  for me      I've read Carr's books and liked the approach  I even quit smoking using his book   but I found Albert Ellis's When AA Doesn't Work For You  Rational Steps to Quitting Alcohol to offer a lot more actionable tools for dealing with the underlying causes of problem drinking  I don't think there's any one perfect solution for everyone  but if you're not into the whole AA thing it might be worth a read  Good luck   Exactly right  only way i could afford 100 a week   So pat on the back for your maths skilzzzzz  Loomish  we speak your name   I will not drink today   Congratulations on your 6 months sober  that's awesome    You will be welcomed at any meeting  but a beginner's meeting would be the best bet if there is one near you  You don't have to share your experiences or even speak at all if you don't want to  A lot of people are just there to listen at any given meeting    It was a huge help for me in learning to live sober permanently  my best advice is don't overthink it  just go  It's also a good idea to try a few different meetings  they can vary in format and personality  Good job  Lmfaoooo seriously  Don't make me call you out by your full name   Tuna  you know we have our moods     I will not drink today   My to do list is too long  and alcohol is not on it  Edited  apparently I've had too much to drink already   i was unable to quit without a therapist supporting me  i went to the therapist and never had a drink again  Sugar in excess amounts  candy  ice cream every night  got me through the cravings  The therapist will keep you accountable for your choices  What country are you in  Here in the US only warning my bottle has on it is that it will increase the risk of birth defects for pregnant women  may impair my ability to drive or operate machinery and may cause health problems   I mean I'm not a pregnant woman so it won't definitively do anything according to the bottle  Just wondering but are you considering doing any type of meetings or treatment or anything  I am right there with you   Started off my morning with yogurt  2 glasses of water  and my first yoga class in 8 months  Thanks   Excellent piece of writing   Ounces would be helpful if you were made out of flour and we intended to bake a cake with your flesh No such thing as one last time   I'd give anything to enjoy opiates in moderation but I can't  We have to accept that it's all or nothing for people like us    Good luck with sobriety this time round     Ah  i'll take a look at Smart Recovery  Glad to see people find AA helpful but I think we're one and the same on that one  Certainly not for me from the research i've done  Still  I might go along to one  It's not like they chain you up and don't let you leave  do they      I've read on here many times that people thought they would be perceived as or be boring without alcohol  but instead find that they and others are boring with alcohol   That's really interesting and I hadn't realised that until now  When I was in Thailand giving up  I'd originally thought I was the boring one  however now I remember that it was those around me  being wasted and talking shit  that made me bored of them  I couldn't find stimulation from people who were stimulated by something else  God I hadn't realised that before   I think you're right about losing depth of thought  I genuinely haven't disagreed with anyone today  and I'm certainly not one to do that often    So often the day just phases by  then the week  then the whole month  I get to the next pay day and think 'how on earth did I get to this point  Where did the month go '  I do remember when I stopped drinking for 2 weeks  and bear in mind this is about 3 years ago  that the days lasted so much longer without booze  I thought at the time this was a boring and monotonous thing  but maybe it can come to be good  From what people say on here  it looks like it will be one day   I can't even express how comfortable I feel in this group  I have already had people say thing to me that I've either never realised  or that I secretly had and I've had to own up to it  I felt so alone before  and so isolated  even though I'm open about my alcoholism with everyone  Now I have a community of a load of people in the same boat as me    Hope your evening goes well too  or day  or whatever time it is over the pond     Shockingly   I went to the movies    All I remember was the screen was big and the characters assholes   This is a really gorgeous post   Thank you so much for sharing your insecurities and your path here   Congratulations on a year  I felt the same and still do  but i just have to wait it out and the feeling will pass  i started driving about which took my mind somewhere else for a moment  Not drinking with you tonight    Glad you're here   The good news is you never have to feel like that again  Been there  if you are like me  you are going to look for other things to lean on now that  you aren't smoking  I think that's alright  over time you are going to evolve and wind down to a stable situation  Try not to let things get out of control  I think it tends to be alcohol and food that hit people the most at first  Sa box in   Because saying  Sa box own  makes your mouth feel weird   thanks man  starting day three today and it seems to be going well  i checkout out yourbrainonporn com and it's insane how much porn can affect the mind For the shit part  I swear by Imodium  magic little pills that have me shitting bricks    And I won't always finish a bottle in a day  just most of it  Because I buy handles  more cost effective that way  Yes  those were the warnings I was speaking of     The key is to figure out what triggers you  and then find ways to avoid that   Some people here  and it sounds like you're among them  enjoy drinking by themselves  so maybe a way to avoid that trigger is to join a softball team  or find a volunteer activity  or join an art class    something that is done with a group and that you have accountability for attending  thanks man    starting my third day and so far so good  I get very mild  almost nonexistent RLS and virtually no insomnia  You aren't alone  stay strong man   i added you as a friend  i'll shoot you a message if i ever feel weak in willpower haha I will not drink today  thanks man  you too     and here's the second  I don't get those symptoms either  Awesome job on getting to 3 grams  I'm having difficulty getting any lower than 6  I envy you  Keep up the good work  i hope so man  thank you  are you quitting as well  that's a good mentality  thank you  Fuck the clinic   thanks bro  29 days is a real feat  good job  does it get easier with time  Therapy and Alanon meetings helped me  Underneath anger there are usually other feelings such as loss  betrayal  abandonment  sadness  hopelessness  confusion  powerlessness  Realizing that the only person I can control is me has taught me to stop trying to change other people and events  The Serenity Prayers is a wonderful tool    Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change     Courage to change the things I can  and      Wisdom to know the difference  Glad you're here   Sorry to hear about your struggles   The good news is you never have to feel like this again   What's in the past can't be undone   What matters next is "what do I choose to do "  I realized that  Alcohol   Me   Undesired Consequences   I decided to eliminate alcohol associated consequences from my life   What do you want for yourself  That is my hope   I truly believe actions influence people more than words do   I have recommitted to walking hiking and have been going regularly  and just last night my husband said he'd like to go with me   He always says no if I ask him   He had to come to that decision by himself  beautiful share   thank you and congrats on one year  My dad liked country music and i remebered him through the music but always when wasted and drinking whisky   Since stopping i now think off him and face the emotions i have been drowning with booze for so long   Johnny cash and willie nelson for me    Another 24 year old alcoholic here  and it's a bitch  no way around it   It's hard when so many people our age are out drinking and drinking seems to be the only thing to do for fun   Well  after over a year of lurking with intermittent success  I've learned there are groups of sober  or one beer and quit  people out there who are crazy fun   Joined a tabletop gaming club which has helped me keep busy on the weekends   It's been tough distancing myself from those friends who pressure me into drinking  but I truly believe that in the end it will be worth it  I couldn't agree more   The most damaging and convincing lie I told myself about drinking was that I couldn't sleep without it   Sleep was so precious to me and I couldn't function unless I had 7  hours of sleep   The first 2 weeks after quitting were rough for sleep but I started exercising daily which helped so much   Now I sleep better than ever and the harder I exercise  the harder I sleep   Also  there have been a few nights I've only slept a few hours  as little as 2   but I was able to get up in the morning  drink some coffee  and tackle my day as I normally would instead of laying on the couch all day half asleep   Hooray for healthier sleeping habits      I have the day off work  but will not be drinking today   They share DNA  but their souls are different      I love the individuality that my twins show   I only dress my twins alike on rare occasions    my husband   I will sometimes take them to different places as "singletons "  I'm hoping that this will help once they enter preschool  because I want them to branch out and feel as comfortable apart as they do together   Thank you for recognizing my upcoming month   I had several years of sobriety before a relapse   For anyone who is wondering  it truly is just as crappy as you remember it being out in the drinking world   I'm guarding my sobriety much more cautiously this time around    I am really looking forward to having a month under my belt again   Glad you're here    That's a great goal you shared   3 months   Look forward to hearing about your progress  Anything gaba like  Perhaps benzos  phenibut  valerian root  kava  passionflower extract  Magnesium citrate or Epsom salts  I've heard icy hot may help rubbed on your legs  Get plenty of vitamins  I tend to think hylands restful legs helps  especially when I'm trying to sleep I'll pop 3 at a time  Try them out  Gabapentin and clonidine you've mentioned are very good I've heard  never tried myself  Lastly is immodium  I am currently taking immodium at slightly high dosages to help with my taper  but tread carefully with the benzos and immodium Yeah but it says may   Not like smokes which have causes cancer on the package   Honest label for alcohol would be "addictive as shit  causes liver failure with time  and withdrawals are a cunt  Also increases your risk for certain cancers " There is really no rule about how we introduce ourselves at meetings   Beautifully written   Thank you for taking the time to get up on your soapbox      A lot of that resonated with me   I'm on day one  looking to do a month and then maybe a year   In the past when I've taken time off the bottle it's been great and then the "ok  now what " feeling comes in   Without a head appearing in the clouds saying "hey dufus  do x  y  z" I usually ended up slipping back towards "killing time" at the pub   It's like I expect the universe to shower me with all kinds of awesome things simply because I stopped drinking   It's that self centered  selfishness that I'll be keeping a wary eye out for this time   Thanks again and best wishes to you for another year under your belt next January  And of course from a purely financial point of view imagine how much money you are saving by not having a single dime go to the complete waste of money that is alcohol   I am in ongoing therapy  I've been to rehab a few times in the past  Last stint was in 2009  I had two years clean after that    No NA meetings  I could never connect to that type of treatment  I do have a few people in my life I am open and honest with  One has been through the wringer herself  The others are just supportive    The truth is that I think that no support network is good enough when I choose to hide from them all   I've been sleeping a lot too  But this is what I've noticed  I wake up after 7 8 hours to piss and I feel better and refreshed than I do when I wake up 2 hours later  sleeping for a total of 10 11 hours too  Take me forever to get going and I feel depressed and lethargic  Nothing too bad  but I think I'm going to force myself to stay awake after 7 8 hours  Maybe you should try it out too for a few days  Yeah  I realized that  My bender may not have lasted this long but due to the holiday season family obligations I had to keep up till right before NYE   It's always up to you  Glad to see you forgave yourself  One thing I am horrible at and still working on  Hope your 2017 year is awesome  Keep in mind that this is just my personal experience   Everyone is different and there are so many variables that dictate how your body will respond   For me  benzo w d was awful because of the hallucinations  depersonalization  etc   At least with those symptoms I could move around   Kratom is the worst  imo  because on top of the malaise  I can't even work or do any physical activities whatsoever   I miss having my legs    I will not drink with you all today    I love this sub so much  Day 15  Drank heavily for the past 2 days and remembered why I don't drink anymore  It is hard to tell how I feel in regards to being kratom free because I feel so damn hungover  but I do know that I am very happy to have made it half a month without the stuff  Its not a linear process   good work  I won't drink with you today   D  Checking in  Oh  don't get me wrong  I cannot moderate either  But  for myself  I don't believe a tiny amount of incidentally ingested alcohol  outside of  the context of  drinking  is a problem much less a form of moderation  Either way  hope the stew was sober and delicious  Cheers  Congrats on your sobriety   Im fortunate to attend really good AA meetings  AA works for me and I know it doesn't for some   I just want to adress the cult comments  By definition  a cult takes resources  usually financial sometimes their very lives  from its members and there is a leader    What do I as a member of AA gain by recruiting  What does the nonexistent leader gain through "brainwashing" us  Nothing    Tone is hard to read so please read this as just conversational  I just think cult is thrown around too often in reference to AA    Have a great Monday everyone   Thanks for the advice  I definitely don't have the balls for that haha but at the same time    what do i have to lose thanks for the post   helps me in a similar situation keep it all together and not crack   Interesting  My first quit CT I had both  But this time I'm tapering and haven't noticed any insomnia or rls  Maybe it's cuz I'm tapering slow enough  but I find this time quitting to be very different and easier  Way less physical  but more mental cravings Thanks man   My brain fogs are currently pretty crappy   Deep down I know time is the only real thing that will heal my brain  At 6 grams a day  Going to try to drop a little bit more tomorrow and hold  My doses barely do anything for me now  All my morning dose does is help wake me up and normalize my mood and night dose helps me from feeling completely depressed and keep the chills away  I'm so tired of this and it's hard to distract myself  This cold weather doesn't help either  If it was warm out with a little sun I think I would try just stopping again  Nothing has changed just wanted to post I guess  I've been thinking of moving abroad as well to pull myself away from friends and others that re enforce my habit  Where did you live abroad OP  Ive lived abroad before  but it was actually where I started smoking   They might catch alight at a steady going rate     ah  actually they won't  Good afternoon   Made it 500 so I think I'll manage another day without alcohol I have such a small support network  Long time lurker first time poster     I have no fucking idea  just can't drink  Comments  Don't say AA    I guess that is why 'one day at a time' is such a big part of aa   I'll sit with you all day and do hour by hour check in's if you need me to   I have an aa meeting from 6 30 8 15 but just say the word and I will help you through the first day  i will not drink today Thanks for sharing  I'm looking forward to seeing these kinds of positive changes in my own life through January and onwards  and I'm sure many of my fellow New Years Resolutioners are excited about it as well  2016 was the first year I actively tried to quit drinking and it was sporadic to say the least  I would urge you to read my post from yesterday  my father provided me some perspective where he basically explained that quitting alcohol for some  not all   simply takes time     Link    https   www reddit com r stopdrinking comments 5limaw my fathers perfect perspective    Good Luck  Hmm    I've been toying with the idea of a tattoo for a long time  That actually appeals   Not yet though  I need to get a fair bit longer under my belt first  Maybe a year or two  STOP WITH YOUR STUPID JUNKIE DRAMA IN CA  I"M NOT FUCKING KIDDING   Good luck with the cleaning endeavor   I don't have much advice   Just here to tell you that it should quickly get better   Drink a ton of water and consider daily supplements    You need to stop writing that n word    It's the second time now and it's not okay     Literally anyone can experiment with solubility and know you and your buddy were full of shit    You're poseurs     Somehow you kids managed to fool everyone here and become mods of a sub with 28k people    kudos    But fuck off you little brats before you hurt someone  As already mentioned  in the early days I avoided gatherings for which one of the primary purposes was alcohol consumption   I also didn't unnecessarily test myself   But that's me  I can relate to this so much  It is very hit and miss for me I can often go out and have a good time  if I'm nervous or uncomfortable or stressed or sometimes haven't eaten that well I get blackouts which is really scary as a young woman  I'm trying to be careful and practicing self assessments between rounds  drinking water and avoiding shots but doesn't always work out  My aunt is a recovered alcoholic and I know it might come to the point we're I will have to stop drinking completely but I will miss the social aspect and worry about loosing friends  I hope you figure out a solution anyway  you certainly aren't alone   I'm soooo jealous   But mostly very happy you've succeeded   I have one question   How does the great feeling you have today compare to a "great" day on kratom   Is there a difference   I keep thinking  "Man  I know that it's possible to feel better someday  but will it ever compare to how good I felt when I was using "  I find it difficult to imagine being happy again like I was when I was doped up  One day at a time  I won't drink with you guys today  I appreciate you taking the time to share a more detailed perspective even though you are so far along on your path to sobriety   It is very helpful for us newbies to imagine what it will be like for us to reach such ambitious milestones   Congratulations on your year of sobriety  I look forward to being where you are someday  Yes  but it felt like such work    Not really looking forward to tonight when I have to be back at work tomorrow morning  but it can't be any worse than the first night  In the very first few days  I went to every meeting I could find   6 00am  7 30 am  Noon  5 30 pm  etc  etc   First couple days I was either in a meeting or traveling to one   Had some lunch and meals with some sober people I met   Then  when I had a couple days strung together  everything started getting easier  Keep on kicking ass  brother  You are doing great   This community is 10000x better than nofap   You're not going to get special powers because you don't watch porn or masturbate  You won't magically get better with women or socially   You won't sprout wings and fly up to heaven  However by not watching porn you will have stronger  better erections and better sexual performance especially with a partner   I can guarantee that because I've experienced it   We can jerk off so we don't need to have the raging circlejerks they have over at nofap  thank you  I am glad this helped you and I am praying for you to have a successful recovery  Peace and God bless   Wow  thanks for this   Your pops is exactly right   I'm proud of what I did in 2016 because it was the FIRST time I ever did something about a problem that has plagued me for many years   Can't expect perfection on the first run s    I'm primed and ready  though   Let's get it in 2017  I will not drink today  Checking in for the first month  Whoops  Im taking the store brand lope  15 2mg pills  30mg is high but I've read people going above 100mg for opiate wd so I'm relatively safe as long as I don't do it every day  Planning on doing it on my drop days  Yesterday I dropped 2g off each dose and I still feel fine  Gonna maintain for a few days first though Will blaming things other than alcohol's power over you solve much  To my knowledge that's pretty close to a 0  success rate  Cool  good to know  30mg is kinda high  but I've heard people taking above 100mg so I feel safe doing it on my drop days only  I dropped 2g off each dose yesterday and now I'm at 3g doses  Gonna maintain the next few days and see how things go  So far  I haven't noticed any increase in symptoms  Zero physical symptoms whatsoever You can do it man   I'm 27 and I've been using internet porn since I was 17 and I've tried to stop since I was 22  At this point I'm just grateful that I found this supporting community and you will too    I recognize the 5 hour  streaks  I did that way too much  smoked weed  kept the curtains closed and just went bezerk on these porn sites and subscriptions   If other people can do it  you can do it  stay strong brother    I think if it was me I would give it a year or at least 6 months  15 years is a long time and there may be things that will get better without weed in your life that you just are not seeing yet  Maybe in 3 months you realize man I feel like I'm sleeping much better and you forgot just how good sleep felt  You forgot after 15 years how good something could be  That's just an example of something you forgot could be so good   Maybe there will be nothing like that but it's worth a year to see what happens  What's a year out of the possibly the rest of your life  It's nothing   If anything after a year your tolerance will be back down and that's a plus     Welcome back friend  I have not  Not that I would be against any of that  I guess I just never explored many options  I'm just a bull headed sob that thinks he can do all this crap on his own    I think I'm fooling myself more than anything with that thought   THIS  I knew I was mentally addicted after my first 10 drinks  But this was awesome  It was drugs that would made you shake and throw up and probably die when you'd stop cold turkey    Apparently  it's the other way around and that's why I get so angry about the bottles  I think I knew when I was 6 years old that pregnant women shouldn't drink  But nobody that isn't alcoholic every mentions alcohol WD's  The great sober feeling is BETTER than a great Kratom day  1000000  Being on Kratom all the time is like you were living in an alien body in some parallel universe  Craziest shit ever  but quitting is so worth it  Being sober  I look back and really think of what a lazy  entitled  loser I was on Kratom  I now realize my mind didn't match who I thought I was and my body betrayed me everyday  Feeling GOOD sober is really a whole new ballgame  Hi  I am also just starting  I am one week today without a drink  This is a good start  So glad to have found people here to chat with  No one in my family friends know I'm doing this as the negative "you will never do it" are words I don't need to hear   I will not drink with you today xx Oh yey sign me up   With my epic powers of self discipline I will no longer single handedly prop up the porn industry   Ha single handedly    My GF and I smoked in her old car and it still smells nasty even though nobody has smoked in it for over a half year   Needless to say nobody smokes in our new cars  even though she still is smoking    I never got how anyone could smoke  cigarettes  in a house  though  Like  I suppose it might not be too bad if there was a specific well ventilated room that was smoked in OCCASIONALLY  but I shudder to think what it must be like otherwise   Thank you everyone  I couldn't have done it without the support of you guys on here  Knowing there is someone to talk to at any time is invaluable  Never thought I could do it  I was always the one who would  never  give up drinking   I will not drink with you today     No  Welcome   Glad you're here   Lot's of community support  Awesome this is great to hear it doesn't prolong wd  I will not be using daily  I use 30mg yesterday and was able to drop 2g off each dose easily  Haven't noticed any physical wd symptoms whatsoever  But I'm going to maintain on my kratom doses for a few days  Then maybe take lope again for another drop  but I think I'll stick to no more than 20mg next time  Assuming it's not delaying my symptoms  I think it's a great helper assuming not using daily    And the phenibut  yeah I need to lay off that for at least a week  I had some serious family issues that day and had to go to a NYE party  Got me through it though  I seem to have a natural high tolerance to that stuff  No hangover or rebound anxiety from it  But I can respect both phenibut and lope as being dangerous to get hooked on Its hard to imagine 51 year olds using reddit   You're an inspiration to us all  The one thing we keep telling our loved ones  over and over is "I'm sorry   It won't ever happen again "  And within hours we're off drinking ourselves out of control yet again   It gets to a point that the only way we can express our remorse is to actually    CHANGE   That is  wrestle our drinking under control   Alcoholics Anonymous is all about abstinence   In fact  one of the rules  or traditions  which form the backbone of AA is that the only requirement for membership is a desire to stop drinking   That's STOP  as in  not drink anymore   We AAers find it's far easier to abstain than to try to control our intake       Quitting drinking and being a good  and sober  dad are my two proudest achievements   Give us a try  Yeh I never really understood that  I'm more of 'go into everything 100miles an hour and expect results yesterday' type of person  I need to change my attitude as well as drinking habits  I appreciate that  its 7 50pm here so hopefully I can go to bed in a few hours and get some sleep  but until then if you dont mind that would be great thank you  I hope to have a year in 11 months  I usually get to 4 or 5 months then drop the ball   I also found the same things to be true during meditation  Buddhism is essentially a 1200 Year old recovery program and can be used in a secular way  which is nice  Any suggestions on meditation books teachers practices would be great  Thanks  I relate   When I read or hear about people wishing to moderate their drinking I cannot relate   To me the thought of only drinking 2 3 beers drinks would be torture  as that's when I'm just getting warmed  primed and started   I'm 150lbs and could drink anyone I met  worked with or rubbed up against at a bar  party or work dinners under the table   Some guys were already wobbling when I'd just start to feel that zone of good   I no longer can find that zone of good as I drink too fast and rocket my way through that ever shrinking and now tiniest zone and into the run out pass out black out  zone   3 drinks   No thanks  It takes 33  and that goes nowhere but bad for me    To me it was replacing one dependence with another  My father started local groups  was very involved  did the regional etc meetings and all of that  He had 10 years sober twice and if he backed away he relapsed  He's no longer with us  I want freedom from dependence and not just alcohol dependence  Yeah I think I'll stick to a lower dose in the future  But I was able to drop 2g off each dose  Down from 5g doses to 3g each  And no noticeable wd symptoms yet  I'm going to maintain on my 3g doses for a few days  then take another lope dose for my next drop to 2g doses  But probably stick to no more than 20mg next time  Assuming this doesn't prolong or worsen my wd symptoms  I think lope is an excellent helper  I'll keep you guys updated Thanks for the advice everyone  I'd love to join a group or go to meetings but an internet search has shown that my nearest is over 50 miles away  I live on a beautiful but pretty remote island  average day to day things aren't always that accessible here  I suppose that's why I've found myself here instead  an opportunity to admit to my problem  which feels really liberating and just to read stories that show I'm not alone in having these struggles and that people have better lives when they quit drinking  that sense of positivity is helping me a lot and reminding me that it will be worthwhile  i am and have been for a month and a half I appreciate all your advice and I will look into Chantix and Super Better  Need to get out and run the puppers more honestly anyways so that'll handle that  I've heard the whacky side effects of chantix but as if smoking is any better haha  Thank you again and enjoy your new year   Sign me up   Good luck everyone  let's start the year strong  If going cold turkey is hard  maybe try weaning it down to maybe one joint a day  Reality I learned in inpatient  Alcohol can kill you if you go cold turkey  opiates make you wish that they did  Other drugs are similar  but to a lesser extent  day one again  I'll make this one stick  I will not drink today  They are temporary  You got this   I will not drink with you today  I like to browse both of these subreddits but mainly stuck over at nofap   Main problem for me is that porn and masturbation are tied together in my mind so I am trying to reboot completely by staying away from both for a while   Just stay careful I have been drinking sweet tea all day  and I never put sugar in anything  I will remember this tip  thank you  Yes  I definitely need to change the way my mind thinks and learn how to cope with things in an other way than drinking  Speaking from my own experience  there are going to be a lot of different hurdles to work through when quitting   My most recent hurdle was the realization that  outside of the nicotine addiction  my desire to smoke was imprinted onto my brain as an acceptable reaction to emotional stress   I'm still working through that particular hurdle  but it consists of reminding myself that smoking is NOT an appropriate reaction to emotional stress because a  I don't want to smoke for a hundred reasons and b  it wouldn't do anything for me anyway except give me lung cancer  a headache  and make me smell bad   Essentially  this has been a rinse and repeat process for me as far as my quits go   First I'll quit for a while and then if I smoke a cigarette  I either ask my therapist  post here  or just try to introspect and find out WHY I smoked a cigarette   My longest quit was about 1 5 years and I'm back on track at  2 months now  coming from nearly a decade of pack a day smoking   Keep it up   Learn from your mistakes  Thank you    2 50pm by me so we can do this   Isn't the internet amazing   We will check in right here   hourly   until you go to bed   Sound good     In the meantime  grab yourself a badge from the sidebar   It's fun to watch the numbers go up     Your 11 months is way more of an achievement than I've gotten to   But I also had the New years it's a special occasion so let me try some weed experience  with similar results   That was in the company of friends  but I had to test out a solo smoke sunday just to make sure I wasn't missing something   As you said  getting stoned itself is not very appealing   The "high" is just sooooo fleeting   And then all the side effects  especially the anxiety of feeling stupid and intellectuals constrained in every way   Worse still  the reemergence of a self hating voice that won't stop harassing me   So  like you  I'm done   Perfect time of year to start that new streak   And there is a big sliver lining to the fact that it doesn't "work" for us anymore    we will avoid it more easily and won't get sucked into wasted weekends or maybe more   Cheers   Good luck    When I first got sober  I didn't think that eating food that was cooked with alcohol wouldn't be a big deal   I did stop using it in my steak sauce and choose not to beer brine my turkey at Thanksgiving  but that was simply because I knew it wasn't necessary and I have other recipes   But a few weeks ago  I grabbed a ham sandwich that had a cheese sauce on it instead of sliced cheese  and man  was that thing good   I was on the verge of writing a poem about that sandwich   Then the beer craving started   Turns out that the sauce was made with beer  and just the taste of it flipped a switch in my brain   I didn't drink  but I was thirsty   I personally won't choose to eat food cooked in alcohol  but I'm sure that there are people that do and it doesn't bother them at all   But I always liked the taste of my drinks as much as the effect  so it's too risky for me  Well after a really hard weekend dealing with my dog being taken away  I'm back on track  I think things will work out with my dog  My girlfriend will have to deal with lawyer and court fees and perhaps be put on probation  but I think we will get the dog back eventually  Ain't gonna be cheap though   I took a lot of kratom on friday and Saturday along with 2 decent sized phenibut doses saturday night at a NYE party  Got me through it though  Sunday  I took 30mg of lope and drop my kratom down to a total of 12g  four 3g doses  When I had taken about 25 30g the previous two days  The lope seemed to have helped a lot  I was still a bit irritable a d lacked motivation  but I have zero physical symptoms  Gonna maintain at 3g doses for a few days  and maybe repeat the drop with lope help  but probably take less this time  Feeling pretty good today  Planning to be kratom free within a week or two lesson learnt    i had a similar experience on new years   got handed the blunt and hit that shit hard  then straight away  all i wanted was MORE MORE MORE    i was stoned af already but i just wanted to be more stoned   i wanted a bong   my mind was already starting to make excuses to start smoking full time again   i think certain  people just can't smoke casual   its either full on or not at all unfortunately     I found lots of reasons AA wouldn't work for me   I wasn't powerless  that was fucking stupid   I wasn't going to believe in god either  stupid weak minded religious folks   Then when I was in enough pain and had lost enough  I decided I'd go and try something different   I realized what powerlessness meant was different than what I thought it meant   I used to get prescribed a medication that was a stimulant   I didn't even like stimulants but frequently I found myself abusing them just because they were in my pocket   I also didn't like the feeling I got from drinking too much too fast  but frequently found myself drunk   That's what it meant to me    Also I'm still a godless heathen  but I'm Ok with hearing god at meeting nowadays   If it worked for them  good   I don't have to buy into all the AA dogma hook  line and sinker   I take what works and leave the rest   If I had my way there wouldn't be any praying at meetings anymore or overt talks of god like in the daily reflections   But unless I start my own program  I guess I'll have to deal    You'll be fine  you DO got this  You've made the most important decision of your life and there's no way you'll regret it  The first few days are rough but don't give in  Read watch Allen Carr and download an app like Smoke Free to keep you motivated   Spent the morning talking to someone I love who will never love me back    In 100 years I will be dead  They will be dead  What the fuck is the  my  point  Congratulations  seriously  The point you made saying something seemed to stick this time  that's what happened with me too  Glad you're taking advantage of that  Good luck and hope to see you in another 100 days  Wow  One week is a really good Start  congratulation   I also Do this without anyone knowing about it   My family and close friends dont know how deep i am were  and I intend to keep it to myself for now     Good Luck  Soak it in aids  Here are a few    "Not taking the first drink"  "Learning to Live Sober"  "Working on Fear  Resentments  Impatience  Intolerance  Guilt  Pride and Anger"  "How do I change years' long patterns and habits "  "Being Kind  Caring and Compassionate to the people in my  life"   Is this what you're asking  I have a question  I'm on  75 mg klonopin and am at 6 grams of kratom a day  You said kratom was a useful tool for getting off benzos  People keep telling me that getting off kratom first will make getting off my klonopin easier  This is why I am trying to get off kratom  I am not only tired of being dependent on it but I also want to get off my benzo  What are your thoughts on this  I spoke to a counselor   She recommended a meeting   I went and got support  tools  resources and fellowship   I've not looked back  Yeah  I've been drinking water and tea like crazy  I do have a multi vitamin I can take  Thanks  Thank you so much for sharing this  it is really helpful   I'm sorry you went through it and it sounds so scary but it is a great motivator to keep going   Your detailed account really helps me imagine what it would be like to go through that   I loved Duff McKagan's book where he talks about how his acute pancreatitis was his rock bottom in a similar situation   Stories like yours will help many of us avoid experiencing this nightmare   Congratulations on your milestone  I look forward to being where you are someday  If you have concern you might be an alcoholic find a local group and pop into an open meeting   Easy to find  http   www aa org pages en US find local aa  It really is as straight forward as that   Just go  sit  and listen   Decide yourself if it's something that may help you   If you want to try cutting back or believe you can manage controlled drinking try  r stopdrinking  I  quite frankly  spent about a year hovering around  r stopdrinking with no success whatsoever even after reading the highly recommended Allen Carr book numerous times   I thought I was a hopeless case and beat myself up about it which just made things worse   EDIT  actually I would say i had SOME success  in terms of being a lesson of 'i cant do this by myself'  AA is not for everyone     it took my hurt and pain becoming stronger than my pride to be willing to go in and listen   Good luck  You've put a smile on my suffering face   Thank you   I can't wait to feel like that  Yup  day two resolutioner over here as well  Not drinking with the both of you today  Kitchen is clean but I kinda gave up on laundry and bought some beer  Hey I have two clean pairs of underwear left   I can do laundry tomorrow   or something   Jealous you went snowboarding  If your boots hurt that much then fucking mark it up as a loss and get some good ones that fit  It will change your whole experience   I'm going in two weeks IF I work enough drink less for the next 14 days  How do you think that might go   Well  it sure sounds like you're drying out  but a physician would be best to make that determination   "How you get through it "  The first few days I went to as many meetings as I could find to  1  keep the urges cravings at bay  and  2  be around sober people who understood the struggle  You right nothing can be flawless  Just discussing ideas  sometimes if problems are identified they can be avoided or minimised  The idea has the potential to help some  Glad you're part of the Community  It could be  It definitely was a major contributing factor for me  What I thought was GAD turned into nearly daily panic attack level anxiety and I've found that the longer I'm sober the less anxious I've been  Off of klonopin now  However  there are other factors in my life as well  I cut out gluten and meditate twice each day  Both I believe have also helped the anxiety  Awesome  And indeed  returning back to the madness at work tomorrow will suck much less without a hangover  Thanks  Glad you're here     I don't have any romantic memories of being Impaired  I meant GAD  Science is now showing the gut is the 2nd leading producer of some neurotransmitters  such as serotonin  related to gad and once believed to exist only in the brain  Great outlook   I will not drink with you today  That is honestly going to always probably be my biggest hurdle as well  I completely understand where you're coming from with it just being imprinted on your brain  I've always enjoy my video games  sadly enough I also enjoy having the cigarette hanging out of my out while I play since I've learned to smoke like I do the past few years  That's mentally the hardest part and the idea of not gaming to prevent smoking like I've both been told and tried to consider just isn't rational to me  Ideally I know I need to mentally just do it  I just need to "man up" and chew on something else while I play  Used my mouth bite sleep guard lmao pretty useful actually  It's with me at work right now lol   But for you  to quit as long as you did and to be on your second strong round you have more promise in yourself to quit than most of us here  Continue on your path and just stay strong  I appreciate your time   That's awesome      I was using for the same about 5 years  super high amounts due to the loss of my leg  I have 342 days clean n I feel amazing    I have to say the biggest help in my recovery   has been therapy sessions    I got twice a month sometimes more but it has helped me so much    After I lost my leg I never spoke to anyone about how I felt  or anything I just bottled it up and used more and more drugs  Through therapy I have learned so much about myself and my drug use    Keep going even if it gets super hard keep seeing your shrink  In the long run it will be well worth it   Nah you're still great  just not "her great" apparently  Good luck with today  hope it isn't too bad  Sure  there are many different systems people use to keep track  Yes  we may be back to square one  but that doesn't means the time we spent already vanishes  that still counts right  I've just hit 24 hours too  You can do this  I wouldn't sit through it  Play it forward  I would write down  in detail  all the reasons I quit  Write down  in detail  all the benefits of not drinking  I would pay very close attention to my thoughts right about now and dispute those that are telling me why I should drink  Come on  126 days  Some times require more work than others  Please don't become complacent  I hope you make it through this rough patch  I will not drink with you today  Checking in  Yes  exactly falling off the wagon is easy  But getting back is not  No problem  Good luck to all of us in 2017  Just drive  It will begin to feel natural soon  Indeed   I only go to bars now when there's a reason other than a drink involved   Hello  I'm an IT support guy at a rehab facility in Florida  I know I work there so it might sound like an advertisement  but I genuinely think our program is incredibly effective  I don't know much about HOW it all works  but I've seen bunches of people leave our program and stay sober  You can check it out at http   RecoveryCoast com or I can get you a personal phone call with the clinical director  I know we take insurance  but we also take cash and I think there's a financing option as well   All the best to you  Let me know if you'd like a call with Evan  clinical director   Well I wish I did during alcohol WD's  But when you learn that you could actually die  the fact that the spiders you're seeing might lead to bigger hallucinations where you're looking out of your window and you'll see WOII going on even though you weren't alive at the time    I'm also not really sure what I'm talking about anymore and I just hope your 2017 will be better than 2016  Yes  I once read a book that said It is not the smoking that is bad  it is the addiction which is bad  I'm not drinking tonight either  Nice  that just sounds like a normal gag reflex vomit  Sounds like you've been taking care of yourself     Stay strong   We're here for you     hello Yes  good idea   The biggest one was financial responsibilities and deadlines  I neglected to balance my checkbook for months on end and I would overdraw my bank account because I just stopped paying attention to it  A few times I forgot to pay my electric or Internet bills on time  and once I almost missed a rent payment  When I saw my credit card bill had exceeded  1000 I had a real "Oh shit" moment and realized this was absolutely unacceptable and irresponsible   Apart from that  I would neglect friendships because I was too focused on smoking weed and being alone  I love to ride my bike  but when I'm high the urge to ride goes away  strange  seeing as I used to love smoking a bowl and going on a long bike ride   I would set chores for myself when I was sober  like keeping my apartment clean  which I would abandon when I got high   Basically all the shit in Because I Got High by Afroman  Just curious  New here  what's PIED stand for  Also  assuming PMO is Porn  Masturbate  Orgasm  Not gaming for at least next 88 days  Hopefully it helps with finals      You are amazing thank you  Just sent message requesting badge  I hope I can get those numbers up  I don't want to forget how bad I feel right now  if I could feel like this forever I would never crave a drink again Day by day though  I need to keep reminding myself this  Yes  well I first wanted to see if the people agree or not  now that they do  we can work on the second part of identifying and minimizing too  Nine years  Bring out the dancing cows  Congratulations  Talking about it is absolutely necessary  IMO  It doesn't mean you have to start a blog or make the rounds as a public speaker  but being open and transparent with family  friends  and continuing participation in a local group are vital   There's something about words and talking about it to other people that makes both the addiction and the recovery more real  And realness is your friend  Today is a very good day to stop drinking  I will not drink with you  what's fake  sign me up I'm sure it will  The more of us that can speak out  the better     I will not drink today  Signed up  Removed because you're soliciting had a link that connects to a seller   Yes  if not as a main counter badge  as a spare one it works too  then people may decide whatever they feel like and go for that one  A request to reset your badge is at this  link  http   sd bot nu badgedate     Too bad she didn't point them here instead of r nowow  we're a lot more active   Agreed  I just don't want to be told I'm sick  Life isn't about winning  If you are dissatisfied with some aspect of you life get on the horse keep trying to change that    I am doing my masters in management and I don't know why    1  find out what you to do with your life  2  start working towards that  It isn't easy  hell I'm a millions miles away from were I want to be in life  but I'm going to keep fighting  You should be proud of yourself  and you have good reason to be hopeful  you've spent some time sober and have learned lessons from your experiences     I wasn't even much of a bar drinker  and when I found myself invited to bar located events during the first year of sobriety  I had to plan really well to make sure I was safe  one was a baby shower  another was a party  and both were with my colleagues  so I wasn't tempted to drink  but even so    I'm glad you recognize that as an issue   In addition to posting here and going to meetings  I sought therapy  which was a big help with my anxiety and depression   Availing myself of any and all resources combated the urge to self medicate and contributed to my success during my first year  I believe     Thanks for sharing your experience  I found it helpful and I'm sure others will too   I second what Prayingforbrightlite said exactly    it feels great  A clean  healthy feeling with no guilt or shame involved   And over the last year I started gradually drinking more and more  What lasted a week started to last a weekend  started to last a night  started to barely get me buzzed  I just needed to get a little drunk every night to unwind and forget the world  Not hammered  but enough to turn my mind off   Have you read This Naked Mind  There's a link for a free download in the sidebar under Featured Book  In it  she discusses how we start out actually drinking moderately  but slowly but surely  the quantity of alcohol increases  It sounds just like your own experience  DONT POST LINKS SELLING STUFF ON HERE      Omg  How do I wake up to this   Last week I had a spam account reply to me on here to sell me stuff then this morning      Sober life is okay   Meeting my sponsor tomorrow   Need to sign up for a new yoga group  I also need to switch shifts with a guy because I signed up for another class Hey there  I'm really sorry to hear what you're going through  I would often do some of the same things as you such as hide my drinking from family  stash alcohol where only I could find it  and do dangerous  things such as drive around pretty drunk hoping that I would die in a car accident  I've had suicidal thoughts because of my drinking for a long time  I've hurt and lost a lot of people I love because of it  I understand what you're going through  I recommend talking to maybe your brother or your kid's father about what you're going through and asking for some help  Try not to be ashamed to ask  I'm sure many people care and love you and only want what's best for you  Take 1 day or 1 hour at a time and don't do any permanent damage to yourself while you're down  We are always here to listen  You are important  Feel better soon  3  PS   who are you cheering for in the Rose Bowl  I believe in you  You can do this  Welcome   This will effectively be my 4th Dry January  although after last year's I never picked up again     In my experience stopping for a month only to start again did next to nothing for me as any gains were quickly lost again    Stopping for a full year has been very beneficial however   I will not drink with you today  First saw when I was 13 during a school project about male and female sexual parts  One of my friends googled "sex"  Months later I watched again and again and again  I'm 21 now  Last september I realized how fucked up my life was and I stopped watching  Although I have relapsed 15 days ago I'm still working on it  I'm willing for day 90  It's definitely gonna be hard  if I have advice for your situation  I would just reflect on how the cigs don't actually add anything to the experience  it's likely just an image of how things  should  be in your head combined with the compulsion to act which is provided by the addiction     you have more promise in yourself to quit  Everyone has that promise   Try  try again  brother sister   Willpower only gets you so far  save it for the moments when you need it   The rest of it is untangling the puzzle of "why"s that lead to you  personally  have decided that inhaling hot  cancerous smoke that will eventually give you heartburn  emphysema  lung cancer and  in the immediate  makes you feel like garbage is somehow a positive thing   Edit  And I do mean that everyone has that promise  AA made you relapse  Or you chose to take the first drink  Take responsibility for your own actions  Well I get that a therapist truly knows what they're doing since that's what they are doing on a daily basis  I'm just simply unsure about how it will feel to me  I'm just introverted and I have a hard time opening up to people  I'm thankful for the great answer though  sometimes you've just gotta hear other peoples ideas around it  YES  I'm always reminded of a saying my friends and I said as  very emo  angsty  teenagers  "Anger is just hurt feelings that are confused "      As I've gotten older and worked through NarAnon and therapy  I've found that while that very much simplifies things  there is some truth to it       Anger absolutely is a valid feeling of its own  But frequently I force myself to examine my anger and find there are a lot of other feelings underneath  as you mentioned  Anger is easy  Anger is an aggressive  outward emotion  Loss  betrayal  abandonment  sadness  etc  are all more passive emotions   they make us vulnerable  often to another person        I call it my "Anger Armor " My anger allows me to detach from the feeling of someone else hurting me  But  while it's 'protecting' me  it's also preventing me from working through all of those things that are causing my anger   meaning my anger doesn't get resolved  I remain angry  and I'm not able to move forward        OP   do your best to make your anger functional to drive you forward  Allow yourself to feel and  be  vulnerable   wherever you feel safest  whether that's in therapy  in meetings  with a trusted friend or significant other  here on this forum  or in private   Sounds like a good plan      I don't stick with these long posts usually cause I immediately don't identify with the feelings and experiences  Your story really spoke to me though  Thanks for sharing and congratulations  As someone who once quit for a year and a half  almost two years   keep up the good work  I hope to be sharing in this same sort of story in another 300  days  Checking in guys  Just got 9 months   The intrusive thoughts have subsided  Can I get a hell yea   Ive just added another 20  It's always the people starting out that keep me sober  You were telling my story my friend  I was 24  drinking alone  or with other drunks who wouldn't judge me for drinking so much  I always thought I was "young and partying"    Well the party is kind of over when you're shitfaced alone and barely scraping by  Congrats on seeing things for what they are  That's the hardest part and as far as i can figure  a lifelong goal  One month is an awesome target  but like you said  you'll get there if you make the next 24 your top priority  On foot in front of the other  Just do the next "right thing"  Man  I REALLY hope it gets better for u soon  I'll be following ur story  There has to be a light at the end of this tunnel  You've put in a whole week   Be respectful of others recovery It's amazing what can trigger us  the good and the bad   But nothing is so bad that drinking won't make it worse     I agree  a mechanical keyboard  a good bed  Investing in yourself is important   Right now those nine days are an excellent investment in your future   Wellness to you  too  I wish I saw spiders    Cockroaches are my demon and fuck they freak me out   I too am praying 2017 will be better  I hope your 2017 will be an improvement as well  That voice is a lying  cheating  conniving little shit     He's out to ruin you   Don't let him   "   but I've been here before and it never ends well "  That's a line I would read over and over   It certainly applies to me whenever I pick up the first drink   And for me it only keeps getting worse and worse when I do  dealing with this right now   I'm on day 2   acute pancreatitis really is the most pain I have been in   But I'm stupid and have been in the hospital 5 times because of it   The visit to the gastro doc a week or two back opened my eyes that  yeah  it's time  I'm sorry you've had a similar situation to mine  And well I do get that a therapist is probably the best alternative  it's just not in my nature to open up and talk to someone I've never met before  I'm an introvert so I have a hard time with it  and yeah an AlaTeen group would probably be a good place to search for  It's just that I wanted a place to start hearing about others experiences and tips so I thought this is a starting point   I'm truly thankful for your answer  it means a lot that people actually want to help   This is me  Exactly  So do you think I should stop kratom and use Suboxone  Sign me up   I cannot let this shit undermine anymore  I had the same leg problem for a good week  maybe a little longer   They felt like lead weights   I could barely move them   I'm a big hiker and I was actually AFRAID to go for a walk with anyone  because I honestly didn't think I'd be able to move   I will say  though  that when I did force myself  after the first 15 minutes or so  my legs loosened up a bit   I was slower than normal  but I was able to move   I promise it gets better   Week two should be a LOT easier than week one   Hang in there   About the spamming post  I was sleepping qui9 messaged all of us to come look     I took it down because of the link selling shit  Bignono   I'm torn about what to do with these types of post  because I want to be respectful of how everyone gets off opiates  On the other hand I see them the same as people who would replace opiates with coke  Was playing poker at the casino and the guy sat next to me had just come back from the smoking area   He smelt AWFUL and it was so strong   I smelt that way my entire adult life    not anymore though  i will not drink today   Who says you can't feel hungover without getting sloshed  Because I was definitely hungover yesterday  I slept for 14 hours last night  Feeling much better now  I think I just need to stop going to bed at 3AM and waking up at 8 30  I'm still comfy in my bed now listening to Transatlanticism and eating Chinese food  No work til 5pm    Not going to a meeting today  I will tomorrow  Not my homegroup  but one close to my house so I can spend less money on a ride  To answer the question  I am grateful for music  for my parents  to be alive  that both of my legs work  that I am employed  for Chris  for my roommates  for Chinese food  and a bunch of other stuff I could type but won't   Check this out  https   www reddit com r stopdrinking comments 5lfp9v recovery from alcoholism ptsd depression anxiety   I'm so glad you're here with us   This is a wonderful place to support you in making the best choices possible     Please be gentle with yourself  I've found that focusing on putting one foot in front of the other and doing the next right thing helps me get through the toughest times   And keep letting us know how it's going  Thanks   I've grown accustomed to suffering and have almost accepted it   As soon as I feel even 1  better  I'll be on here for sure  That's wonderful  Here are a few things that helped me when I first quit drinking     telling my friends that I'd quit before we were in a situation where it would come up  Different people handled it differently  but my friends all accepted it     avoiding situations that would be primarily about drinking  So I learned I was fine getting dinner with friends  going bowling or playing pool  seeing a band    but hanging out in a bar watching other people drink was  and still is  pretty uncomfortable for me     was always ready to call it a night whenever a situation made me uncomfortable or think about drinking  This means being in control of my transportation  not being tied to others wanting to stay leave  and also giving myself permission to bail out if its uncomfortable   Around here a lot of people say "meth a dawn" and it drives me fucking nuts   Just as I was lighting the first joint I knew what would happen  I would crave more until I dropped  and that became true  The only restaraining factor was that if you are to fucked up you just can't do any more  but the second that passes you buzz of number two and you're off   It just angers me because if I could I would totally just buy a baggy and then smoke when the situations calls for it  but if I have it at home  that situation will just happen  either I'll fake a reason to celebate with it or I'll rationalize it with the fact that I'm not doing anything of note today anyway  why not he high   Like I do with alcohol sometimes  the difference is that I can and I stop myself in regards to alcohol  I rarely get shitfaced but I often take the edge off with alcohol   I wish I could curb my alcohol with  a joint  but  A  joint turns out is code for 15 joints     I had one of the comfiest sleeps ever last night  Felt so good  Woke up late and hit the gym hard  Hit back and it's really starting to develop and my weight is going up which is great to see  I have exactly 3 weeks left of break and while I am looking forward to the start of the spring semester  I am really enjoying this break  Last year I was bored and just wanted it to be over  Now I am enjoying the simple things and having fun   I think over 2016 I matured a bit  and trust me  I am still immature and have a long way to go  but I think I've made some progress  I have a better vision of what I want in life and I have a better work ethic  I think that will help me shape 2017 into a year that will be great  Sure  there will be things that will happen that I can't prevent  but my attitude will determine the outcome in those situations   In previous years I battled with the issue of loneliness  It's not a problem these days  I enjoy my own company  I go with the flow  if I meet the right person and there is a spark then I will welcome it with open arms  and if not  I will continue on my own path  Depression is a non issue these days  While clinical depression is part of my diagnosis I think it was the result of my attitude and my apparent inability to take control  I've defeated it  I was once so insecure  now I am confident    2017 has been great  for the whole day and a half I've experienced   and I can't wait to see what's in store  I tried to stop drinking without smoking a couple of times  thinking that weed was part of my addictive cycle with booze  but I end up back drinking every time I try to totally quit weed   Now I've been sober for a little while off booze and I only smoke when I feel like I really need to for anxiety or depression     I think cannabis is very medicinal and has clear benefits for those like me who drink drank to cope with anxiety  however it can be "abused"  I hate using that word for pot  like alcohol  but it's nowhere near as dangerous or even on the same scale as alcohol in terms of mental and physical damage   I think even recreational is fine  it's not abnormal or unnatural to want to feel good  only that there is a point where weed can be used as a way to mask one's feelings and not deal with them which is detrimental in the long run  Actually forgot this post  it has been a month lol  Your ex bf sounds like a real douche if he broke up with you for this reason     Other people don't fully understand what it's like to have this fear constantly and that I have developed a habit that is hard to let go of   I understood that my reactions with my gf were so inappropriate  to the point that I can't stop to apologize with her anytime the occasion come by   Problem is that I didn't know how   serious   this problem was is  and I know that the only thing I can offer to her is my support whenever she decides to take a turn in her position  which  as for now  is a straight   no    but she's considering it   Dude  congrats  It feels so good to know you're now in control  But take it positively  know that you're still powerless but are the one in control of choice   I'm at 17 months and it all started from having 1 day    Excellent   I've found that helping others is a good way to hold onto gratitude and kindness  both of which are essential ingredients in my sobriety   Let us know how it's going  Indeed I shall not be watching GoT for quite some time  Nice work and congratulations on the personal recognition   Yes it enables a lot of things  It changes you from someone passive to someone who goes out there and gets what he wants   You're at the point where this really turns into a mental game  especially when you add back in the element of work   There comes a point where you've survived the worst of the physical withdrawals  and all that's left are the mental and emotional symptoms  somethings lack of motivation  sometimes cravings  sometimes depression  sometimes all of the above   The best you can do is remind yourself that these are symptoms  too    I know they feel more like your normal state of mind  but they're not   You are still healing   Kratom is still messing with you   But I promise that this  too  shall pass   Go to work  plaster on a fake smile if you need to   The real smile will come   You know how to do your job  and if anything  as you heal from kratom  you're going to be a whole lot better at it because the brain fog is going to go away   Your enthusiasm will come back tenfold   It really will   These are PAWS symptoms  and they are going to start fading fast in the next week or two   I can't wait to hear your post a week from now  when you are MUCH improved   I'm sure of it    Yeah  that's what it seemed like to me too  But still  Hahaha   I feel ya   The cold weather really makes it a lot harder   Out my window  there is nothing but dead trees and grey and cold   Just know that there's a lot of us in this community  and we're pulling for you and we care about you  I like camomile and peppermint tea  I like soda water with ice and slices of lemon in it   I have allowed myself to eat a bit of junk food the last few days on the start of my journey  I need to lose weight and not drinking will help  But allowing myself a bit of leeway with food in the first few days so I stick to the no alcohol   Hang in there  Glad your other half doing this too  Mine is continuing to drink which isn't helping     Good luck  Thanks  I needed this  Perfect timing  Yeah it's something we got used too but it's great that age is not defining the usage of a computer and online communities  I first discovered porn by accident while borrowing a laptop of a relative  I think I was about 13 years old  From there  it escalated for years  with sessions becoming longer and the content ever more disturbing  During the holidays I had a 6 hour session  in which I spent a lot of money on porn  The next morning was when I sat down and had a good  long thinking about the implications of my addiction  both time wise and money wise  That's when I searched for advice online  and found this site  After having read a ton of posts  and recognizing myself and my actions in most of them  I signed up right away  I am now on my 5th day  28 years old  Not drinking  Programming and chilling  Girlfriend coming over tonight for a movie    I kept waiting for the Really Big Thing to happen to me  When it didn't  it was as though life had let me down  over promising and under delivering   Holy shit  man  I am just starting this journey but I think you finally articulated something fundamental at the root of my problems  I'll join you I had awesome vibrant  intricate dreams on Chantix  if I could take something that did that again with the absence of other side effects like Chantix   I would  You've got this man  Gotta know how shitty things can be in order to appreciate how great they can be in contrast   Not drinking with you today pal  I will not drink today  Thanks brother  I have a question for you  Did you achieve what you want in life  You don't have a regret that this time wasted could make you in a better place than you are now  That you have wasted time trying to work to achieve things in life  This regret feeling  you still have it  How you can wake up smiling in the morning knowing you wasted so much time   People think you achieved your potential although you didn't do your best and you tell them yes with a smiling face  This acknowledgment doesn't make you burn inside  i don't know how it's worse than bingeing  i also don't know how to change my mindset  The self hating aspect of it really is the worst imo  I can't even savor the high because I'm hating on myself mid high for being high  It completely ruins the experience  even when I told myself this was a weekend only deal   Honestly tho  the first few tokes was incredible and I experienced none of the bad effects  but the second or third joint in it was ruined   What I will do in the future is perhaps buy a bag and then set a date  like if I buy on friday  it will be trashed on sunday morning regardless  the money aspect of if is nothing   To get high for two days for the price of a few bears at the bar is okey  I'm likely to fall of the wagon again  but now I am armed with knowledge and I am not afraid of flushing stuff I have left over   Having something doesn't mean I have to use it   I realize how stupid it seems to keep flushing weed but if it stops me from day smoking and sticking to big weekends or concerts then it's worth it     Of course  It's super difficult  I've been on many long streaks and have always been happiest during them  so it's worth the effort for sure  But don't ever get discouraged if you fall  Just get back up   Thank you  I'm just starting this journey and you pretty much read my mind with all the questions and excuses  But I'm still going to try in spite of all of them  I will not drink today  I'm way way too dizzy to drive and I have warrants so I can't call 911   Thanks for this  I know people who casually smoke  but trying to quit is teaching me I'm not one of them  Stay strong  I'm so glad that you're planning to be kratom free   Keep checking in and giving us updates   Good luck  dude  Thank you for the comment  I'm already getting so much just reading through the posts and realizing how much I relate   Checking in  stay strong all  Been vaping for awhile now and just dropped it yesterday when I was hungover as shit  Today feels weird  Yes it really caught me off guard  especially because I had by far the strongest urgest to play EVER  But I stayed strong and after that I seriously never had any real cravings again    I figured out that gaming itself was not the real problem but it was me  and as soon as I fixed me  the gaming disappeared as well    Congrats on your month    That's the hardest one   Thanks for your kind words  And it's a great day to be sober   Thanks Mouse      You  might also be coming down with something  I got some sort of respiratory bug that made me feel like I was hit by a truck this weekend  Get lots of rest and fluids  it's a good Rx for whatever the cause is  Best wishes  Your sharing helps me to never forget the power of one drink  I started drinking again in 2005 after many years without alcohol  By year four off the wagon  I had two serious falls down the stairs resulting in broken fractured bones  broken teeth  concussions  an eventual retinal detachment  followed by another  Yet I drank for several more years   until 2015  During those years of destroying my health  my sanity  my marriage  the respect of my children  our finances  my career   I seemed oblivious to family and friends' concerns although I was internally miserable  A grandchild  who today is the most beloved person in my universe  was born during that period  None of the havoc made me stop  My grandson didn't make me stop  Shame and self loathing didn't make me stop  I either didn't care or felt that I couldn't stop  Somehow I made it back and like you  my guard will always be up  And so I stay committed to my recovery program  I don't think I have another recovery left  The choice for me today is life or death   do you all think it is okay for me to release  in moderation  when the urge arises   Not just okay     essential    imho  Try fiber before you anally tear your tissues up  We're drunks  We bleed when we vomit  Not when we shit    Well  not often   Thank you for writing this  Porn Induced Erectile Dysfunction   and yes  you are correct about PMO    Kratom likes to do this thing where it makes you feel you're doing well  either by tapering or going CT  then it turns around and seems to pull you way back to the beginning  when everything was really horrible   It's an evil  sneaky bastard   The thing I noticed was that  when these bad moments returned and made me feel like I hadn't really achieved anything  if I just held on  they were generally MUCH better the next day   It's like it only lasts long enough to see if you'll cave and take more kratom  and if you don't  it gives up until the next try   And over time  these regressions come less and less  farther and farther apart  until they're gone completely   Step back and see how far you've come overall     You are really doing an awesome job   This is just a little bump in the path   Promise    It will  I did engineering and business  Both of them are pretty shit and the work is pretty shit  I don't care about money and I am not happy working in both fields  I want to be happy doing my job  I have a feeling that I am going through life doing things I don't know why I am doing them and I use porn as a reward system I wanted to be an army officer like my dad but It is too late as I passed the required age I wasn't aware of my real passion when I was younger although people told me to apply for the army   Porn is a way that helps me cope with my miserable life and I don't think it is easy to stop it when I don't have better things to replace  I haven't been to the movies in forever  Last time I passes out on my date n he had to carry me put  It was cute I'm sure  I always fall asleep in them    So was that you   Get that dog back      Everything is easier with a dog at your side      Good luck with your next drop and getting the lope down too   Can't wait to hear when you're kratom free     do strength training x2 per week   lose 12 lbs   get back into running    do physical exercise x 2 per week    10k steps per day   That's it written down now which feels good  Can you describe why you felt your life was in a shambles and how porn contributed to it  WE ARE Why not   I'll check it out Thanks Fuck 'em  You say they're over the pond      where      "Millstone" by Brand New Nah  conscious throughout and dinner afterwards    I was good    I tried   Use net newsgroups  Back when cable Internet first deployed in the 90s  It's been a problem since then  Finally decided I had enough in December  Pasta is one of my favorite foods  and I'm talking that good super fiber stuff  It still happens for me  I think I was just born with a weak asshole   That or we use cheap ass toilet paper  happened before I was an alcoholic   Edit  if it's happening on any regular basis when you puke you might want to take a chill pill  I've had it happen once  caused me to take 2 months sober  It depends on how much discipline you expect of yourself and what your goals are  Thank you for this message of hope   There are a lot us who are struggling so hard right now    Keep it going   Distract yourself  Learn a new skill  Learn a new language  Learn an instrument  Keep yourself not bored  I felt very much the same way about therapy  I've been going for 8 months now  and I can truly say I feel like my therapist is my "best friend " in a sense  She's the one person I can tell anything and everything to  with absolutely no judgement  she never gets annoyed by me bringing up the same issues over and over  I don't feel guilty about our conversations being one sided  I don't have to fight for her attention since the time we spend together is scheduled just for me        It definitely takes time  and the first few sessions can be awkward  but you will build up that rapport and get comfortable  and find relief   Way to go   One year   Wow  But neuro circuitry  wise  no   You're back to square one  At least your kitchen is clean   and if you have clean underwear for 2 days   the rest can wait     I haven't ever had decent boots   but even the ones I bought with the board  that were too small  were better than these  Grrr  and think I spent more money on these boots than on my used board    As far as your plans  what could possibly go wrong   Welcome back  I will not drink with you today  Trust me  Metamucil      LemOut Oddly enough  I had to change my thinking  my whole attitude and outlook on life     Then again  when I crawled into my first AA meeting   I had no hope of anything but dying of alcoholism      I haven't had a drink since then     I don't put alcohol or alcoholics on a pedestal    I hope I never think drinking again is a good idea    True  there are many paths to sobriety    AA is the one I found  and I have had 100  success with it   Aw man my new years was like a flashback into stoner heaven for me   I had soda   I don't drink soda anymore because I disslike the test  but high I like it  I had 5 6 bags of crisps and different kinds of dip  I had a huge steak dinner made for me with steak  onion rings  tripple fried french fries  home made  hestons recepie  with all the trimmings   I had weed  I had ciggs  I had beers I was a fucking pig on new years   holy crap  Simply because I was getting weed  it was fine to get everything else just hang loose     No  I did not   Most nights I smoke after the children go to bed as a nightcap   I'm ambivalent about it  honestly   As far as just substances qua substances go  my experience of weed has been pretty innocuous   When I run out it can take a little while to get more  and that's okay   It doesn't cause me to crave alcohol when I use it   I enjoy it and  when I began smoking  I was having a lot problems with anger   It helped with that  I think  and even helped keep me more level the next day too   I dunno  man   I'm not gonna stan for weed   It doesn't make me smarter  and maybe I'd be better off without it  but maybe the anger would've snuck up and gotten me if I didn't use   It's still a little weird to me that I can walk into a dr's office and say  "I'm experiencing joylessness" and be given pretty powerful medicine  but weed is somehow different   I don't think I'll use it when my girls get older  but it seems to be fine now   Your mileage may vary   I hear positive and negative things about it  I went to Alcoholics Anonymous and met some of the greatest friends I've ever had in my life  all sober  The fellowship of AA is unparalleled   Just a fuck ton of their  they're and there to parse here    Jesus fuck  buy a grammar dictionary for 2017    Good luck Fucky   I believe it is to follow the AA  as in being sober for X days   You summed it up perfectly   LEAD LEGS   They suck   I too  was very athletic and healthy prior to these withdrawls   It's truly shocking for me going from that to this unfortunate  sedentary lifestyle   I can't wait to be agile again   Thanks for the inspiration    Welcome   Take it from me  2nd January is a great day to quit  It's what I did this time last year  I had to take things one day at a time   I will not drink with you today  Yeah  my apologies for the formatting and chaos of my first post   I was in a bit of an off state  I do have very controlled and scheduled dose times and amounts  so it's really not chaotic  dispite how it may sound in my previous posts  I had 2 doses yesterday  normal is 2  sometimes 3  of 2 5g and 3g  I was in pretty bad withdrawal most of the night  so I took 1g in caps this morning around 8 30 to help get some more sleep  I'm quite confident at this point that it's my thryoid to blame for most  if not all  of these weird mood swings and most of my other issues  from the kratom affecting my thyroid   but I should be on my way to a full recovery unless there really is some other  worse problem  but after a couple days after that strange "attack"  I'm pretty sure it's just the kratom and I had a really off experience because of some kind of hormone attack due to my thyroid being so out of whack  I'll be tapering down for at least 5 6 days here and then probably dropping off of it completely for at least long enough to analyze my problems  if not forever  Kratom is still my "friend" and can be a great thing  but only if used properly  It can easily be misused and or abused  Thank for the responses  Thanks  That is some great insight into expectation   An old boy in AA I really like told me to "have hope  not expectations"  which really works for me   Hope I can have in the now  expectations extenguish opportunities in the present   I like that   Thanks for sharing  We can't answer this question   you really need a dr and don't let warrants cost you your life    This is a medical question  Only a doctor can adequately assess your detox needs   Thanks  Liz   I've appreciated your presence and input on this sub on my journey  I'm beginning to feel this way about AA after going to a bunch of meetings in my first month  The real tipping point was a week ago when an older lady came up to me after the meeting  seeing that I was a newcomer to this particular meeting   She started with small talk  but suddenly became very insistent and started talking at me  She said to me  "YOU WOULDN'T HAVE WALKED IN HERE WITHOUT GOD  WITHOUT GOD  you would be in prostitution  living on the street  "    She continued on and I started getting annoyed and was like  lol "I made the decision to walk in here  not god"     She was like  "Young lady  you need to get on your knees every single day and pray  or you will not stay sober  It's clear to me you haven't even read the first step "  I laughed  I just couldn't help it     This ticked her off and she walked away while still talking about how I'm nothing without God     I am with you though  I prefer to feel empowered  When I feel beaten down and told I'm powerless  it just depresses me      I think it's a dangerous way to do things  A streak is consecutive days   breaking the streak means it's no longer consecutive  If you don't reset  I think it gives a false sense of accomplishment  If a heroin addict said they'd been off dope for 3 years  but they'd used 4 times in that 3 years  I'd call them a clown   It doesn't delete you past progress  but it definitely breaks the streak  If when you do relapse  you should use it as motivation to make your next streak longer  Oh yes it truly is  And the good thing is that I don't even regret anything  Not everything was bad and because of the stopgaming experience I am sensitive to all the good things that are around me but I was blind to see before   I doubt you'll have anything other than mild anxiety or difficulty falling asleep  If you're really worried you should ask your doctor though  we are not medical professionals  Best wishes  Very interesting  Thanks for the explanation  Hey there  I just stopped tobacco last week  Honestly  it really sucks but you will get used to it  Start running  which will really suck at first   or walking  or hit the gym  You need to break a habit and this 1 isn't all that easy to break  Make goals and stick to them  "Mind over matter" has never been more appropriate  Lifestyle changes are hard but that 1st day you will be able to run 2 miles will show you how far you've come  Strive for it   You're not alone   Sounds like a good way to start the year  refocused with a clear vision from re learning a lesson you needed to have   Best of luck for 2017 I didn't need to go to AA to become and remain sober  I am sure some AA folks will think I'm not really sober because I didn't go to AA  They might call people DRY DRUNKs or other bad names because we didn't do the 12 steps  I really don't need the 12 steps and don't believe they would help me in any way  Just my opinion  I agree 110    Waking up SUCKS and getting out of bed is insanely difficult   As soon as I open my eyes  every morning since I quit  a massive wave of anxiety washes over me   I'm hoping this doesn't last long   Thanks for posting   We're all on your team and wish you the best  Thanks   Just moved to a new state a couple months ago   No doctor yet    Woohoo  On day 3 here  One step at a time  I have been vaping and it's keeping me sane  Best of luck  PENN STATE    I'm truly happy that I no longer plan my days around alcohol   Have picked up many things along my journey   half marathon  bass guitar  yoga  baking  cooking  photography   mainly portraits   gimp   aperture  old software for mac  for photo editing  traveling   galapagos  Fiji  Cambodia  mexico  yellowstone  cape cod  etc etc   You really don't look back     All the best in 2017   Is there anything that you've learned in the past week that you feel helps you to be more successful in your endeavor to be pornfree  one year jan 1st  I'm really sorry for your loss and your grief  It sounds like you might really benefit from counseling for your loss and the drinking  too  Going on anti depressants might help  but be aware that they are limited in usefulness if you continue to drink  Best wishes  Hah   They're a fine group who help a lot of people  but not my thing either   Other ideas      Therapist   Make sure you click with them   I had one okay one  but needed to switch to address my drinking with    The first one kept pushing moderation    It helps me to have a once a week place to process my stuff at     SD  Google the term "online alcohol support groups" for a bunch of alternatives  see if you find one that you like  I tried a few  but get the best support for me here at SD   so many people who share what they've learned   I spend at least an hour a day here at this point in my recovery     In personal terms  I have a very few people I talk with about this   I'm so consumed by it right now  it wouldn't be fair to expect much in the way of processing it with them   It is my journey to make  or not   and so I find the non drinking help I need in this community  Any time  Good luck to you     I'm so glad to read this  This is a great sub  We never know when we are helping someone  Happy you made it     do you do any playing in moderation  I'm starting the detox now  but I really don't want to quit completely because I literally just dropped  300 on an xbox one    Do you drink any caffeinated beverages  Nicotine affects the rate at which caffeine is metabolised   I adore the combo of ketchup and mustard   They were meant to go together  Welcome  Congrats on a year     cue confetti and balloons  How old were you first experienced porn  What was the driving force to you saying 'enough'  Same when I'm trying to help  Thanks for your kind words   With respect to writing  I feel exactly the way you do   That I'm getting lost in recursive thinking and it's all shitty and self indulgent and nobody cares   Keep forcing yourself to hit that submit button   Those are the same insecurities that keep me from sticking my hand out at a meeting or otherwise putting myself out there  You aren't trying be Saul Bellow here   SD can't help the person who doesn't post  Each time I've tried to stop drinking  the first few days were usually the hardest for me  Issues sleeping  aches and pains  stomach problems  and mind numbing cravings    I found that buying a big ol bag of lollipops can help the drink craving  or exercise  Want a drink  Go on a run  Or eat a sucker  Everyone's different though  Best of luck  and drink lots of water    Hang in there  You can do this  Irritability is a common factor of quitting and is normal  If you keep up your efforts you will eventually be able to be smoke free and a person who isnt irritable    That one toke that takes you into numbness is a patch for an emotional problem  Theres no chemical solution to an emotional problem    Be the best version of yourself  I'm in  I am with you  Back at Day 1 myself  Two kids  single Mum  Sending you love  It's hard work  We can get through it  Not drinking with you today  My breath smelled like that for a month before I was hospitalized  I think it's the pancreas malfunctioning shutting down  My children were a major motivation  They deserved a sober  healthy mother  I got professional help in the form of a therapist  She got me started on the road to recovery  I saw a doctor who evaluated my detox needs  Were you honest with the doctor about how much you are drinking  Anti depressants are not effective in combination with alcohol  I went to detox  rehab  outpatient  and got involved in AA  It sounds like you need more support  The powerlessness of addiction was is the depth of despair  The freedom of sobriety is intoxicating  There is help if you want it   Look at that shiny 30 day star  Congrats    Check out HAMS Reduction   I'm right there with you  just over 25 hours  You can do it  If this were easy then everyone would do it  right  I hope things get better for you  I won't drink with you today     Wtf Chief isn't a slur  I think you're overeacting to the troll bud  Looks like GodMod agrees  Maybe  I've found my best answer to this question and similar ones is to pay really close  honest attention to my own experience with a given substance  I've never had any issue with weed and do not feel it has any relationship to my alcohol abuse  I know others for whom the two are intertwined and there is some reciprocity in their use    It might be helpful   or at least it has been for me   to really focus  with a range of inputs  on defining what exactly being "sober" or abstinent means for me    For me it really just means never  ever drinking  Period    It does not necessarily mean  abstaining from marijuana  mostly just CBD only edibles   canceling my  yearly psychedelic usage  having a spiritual practice  going to meetings regularly  losing weight  being a "better" person  etc    For many others  it may mean some or all of these things  And all the more power to them  But the point is we each have to decide individually what our real and true goal is  No doubt it's useful to ask around and humbly listen to others experiences as we try to figure it out but I suspect we are the most likely to succeed when we are really trying to do good by ourself and own expectations   This is a big one I'm going to have to tackle tomorrow  As a service plumber  I drive a lot     I know this is off topic  but I don't know where else to ask   Dunno   There's  r RedditorsInRecovery   But I don't think it's so off topic that you can't post it here     I'm sicker than I ever was in withdrawals  Wikipedia says that quetiapine  Seroquel  should be tapered gradually  not stopped abruptly  in order to avoid withdrawal symptoms    Edit   If you really need to get to a hospital  you could take a taxicab there   But  in my country  hospital emergency rooms can make you wait for hours to see a doctor   It might be quicker to take a taxicab to a walk in clinic    A   Is there any way you could walk or hitchhike or cab it to a walk in clinic  to get a prescription for more Seroquel   B   Are there any doctors in your state who do house calls     I relapsed out of pure pain and desperation and it barely takes the edge off   Street heroin isn't so pure or safe   Desperate individuals can get methadone or Suboxone from a doctor   If even this is impossible  they can get kratom from a head shop   Even though methadone  Suboxone  and kratom are addictive  anything is better than heroin   C   How much heroin did you use today  Anger is a weird emotion  It's something that I use to protect myself from harm  but once it starts  the harmful thing can go away  but my anger remains    With family  anger can linger long past its original cause   I used to feel like they needed to do something to make amends before I could stop being angry  this turns out not to be true   The 12 steps in Alanon are a process that helped me regain sanity and rationality where I was angry   The steps completely dismantled the resentments in my life and turned them around into productivity  happiness  joy and freedom     But I wasn't willing to do the steps until it got so bad that I couldn't stand it anymore   Before that  a "trick" that helped pull me back from the brink was to "look for where they are right"  With the people I hated  I spent time actively trying to recognize and encourage what I like about them   This helped me not hate them so much and also helped me recognize when to hang with them and when to walk away   thanks for the encouragement man  good luck to you as well    I thought this was a different sub at first      I'm prescribed lomotil etc but usually I just deal with it  I prefer the ass piss to painful monster shit   Checking in  all is well so far  Good luck  keep it up everyone    You said it yourself  there's always a bright side  even when it might not seem like it  I won't drink with you today  Great message   We addicts just love our secret places  I got really stuck at the 7 to 8 grams  I ended up just reducing each dose by  1 gram at a time to get over the hump  You will get there   counselling   find a way to get away my man   go live in the mountains for a little while or something like that   you are an intelligent man with much potential and you need a cleanse    Congrats on a year  That's huge  I get horrendous anxiety and panic attacks after drinking and it's one of the main reasons I can't do this to myself anymore  It's almost like I constantly have this lurking feeling in the back of my mind one of these days my drinking will all catch up with me  I've lost two relatives to it in the past two years which has increased my anxiety after actually being in a liver ward visiting     A hangover and associated guilt from drinking tips me over the edge and I spend the whole next day having panic attacks if I can feel pain where my liver is and checking myself in the mirror constantly to see the colour of my skin and eyes     I will tell you in 2015 I quit for 11 months and all that fear disappeared  I have never felt so healthy  As for all the other stresses  without that on top of you  you can handle it  Your thought process and coping become much clearer  It is amazing  honestly  I cannot wait to feel that way again and even a simple 8 days in now I'm already much calmer and less worried about my health  Good luck     Since you're already on kratom  I'm not sure   If you want to know  make a new top level text post and ask  Madrid and then the northwest of Italy  Be respectful I'm glad you put up a great big "welcome" thread    To anyone new to SD   welcome  and big hugs  This is truly a great place  and though I go to AA as well  I love that I can just pull up SD on my phone any hour of the day or night and instantly have dozens of others to relate to whatever I'm going through in that moment    Do not be afraid to reach out to us       I'm not drinking with everyone here today  Here's to another sober 24 hours  Don't sell things It took me a while to figure out that I don't need to let other people's opinion of me influence my sobriety   Start going to the gym  Spend money on protein instead of booze  Get some goals in mind    There is absolutely JACK SHIT that I'm better at when I'm high  The only reason this illusion was created was that I was smoking so much that it was normal for me    BRUHHHHHHHHHHHH  I am WORTHLESS when I'm stoned   I believe in you  You've so totally got this  I won't drink with you today  The withdraws are so fresh I feel like I'm dying  I don't have the regret  because it's a pointless thing to hold onto  By "having the regret" and just thinking about "all that wasted time" you are wasting ACTUAL TIME RIGHT NOW IN THIS FUCKING MOMENT   That's super wasteful  Just be grateful that you are even able to SEE what you need to change about yourself and your habits   That used to make me burn inside until I discovered my outward persona and my inward life  if people think you've reached your potential and are proud of you just accept that but keep working on yourself in the mean time   It's pointless having regret based on time that has passed  it's done  it's gone  and that can be either very depressing or very empowering  and that my friend is a conscious choice only you can make   Little steps   EDIT  I haven't achieved in life what I want  YET  I have  however  achieved some success in the eyes of other people  Those two things are completely separate but they should not alter your feeling of happiness or growth     Thank you again and you're right  everyone can overcome anything if they put their minds to it  Appreciate you   Where did you do your graduate studies  if you don't mind me asking   Oh man  you're in my wheelhouse now   Headspace is a great meditation app for beginners and the timers and counter is useful for more experienced practitioners   Gil Fronsdale's podcast Audio Dharma is wonderful and should be listened to by all human beings   Early on I read the Tibetan Book Of Living and Dying  which was fantastic  although a bit dense   The Mind Illuminated  John Yates  and Mastering the Core Teachings of the Buddha  Daniel Ingram  are two wonderful meditation guides for more experienced practitioners and could give the beginner an overview of what may be out there   These things are no bullshit though   I wish I had gotten a teacher before diving into these two books   I'm sure I'm leaving someone out   Jack Kornfield's stuff is great   Rick Archer's podcast "Buddha at the gas pump" is a series of lengthy interviews with ordinary people who have had spiritual awakenings   What are you into  Normally  I wouldn't  Having the person you spent almost everyday with for roughly 4 years think that you're a waste of life  makes it a bit tougher  But there's no point in letting it wear me down anymore    You can take it back  I believe in you  I won't drink with you today   Thank you    What you say is so true    It bites you when you're not looking    This is really tough but the only way is through it   It does only last for a day and I have to keep hanging onto that   Thank you for being here for me   It is a scary experience and good to have someone that has gone before me to relieve the stress  Way to aggressive for me  Sorry  You are not alone   I've been going to AA 2x week for 8 5 months   I have a sponsor  I've read the BB 3 times  I'm doing step work  and I'm one hundred percent DONE with AA   When I started I had very little knowledge about AA other than a feeling that it didn't work   I gave it the college try and I can't stand it   The only reason I still go is because it's ubiquitous    Thanks for sticking with me   Good on you for getting back on the horse    I am grateful for the ability to be available to the people that need me  My nana is in hospice care being evaluated and I get to deal with this with a clear mind  it's a beautiful thing   I'm grateful I got asked to speak last night  it was helpful  I was asked to speak Thursday for a homegroup  Wednesday for hni  and end of the month for a celebration  I'm grateful that I have this opportunity    I'm grateful that I can sleep without any substances  and wake up without thinking I need a substance to get through the day   I'm grateful that I can appreciate the love I get and give love back  I have always been a taker  to be able to give back is a wonderful thing   I'm grateful that I'm taking advantage of this opportunity to remain sober and help others the same way I've been helped   I hope everyone starting out sticks to this because it's a great ride  I could come up with 1000 excuses to drunk or get high  but there is no good reason for me to   Not drinking today  Last year  I had to reset my badge more than I'd like to admit  taking it one day at a time  looking forward to a sober 2017  Good luck with your pledge everyone  I know I'm not drinking today   1  I took your suggestion  I indeed reported the OP's post with the free text comment    Spam  The OP's link is to a sales site    tealhill    u Splinter1591 then removed the OP within an hour    Edit   Dear  u funknut   You didn't report the OP yourself twelve hours ago   Good luck on your journey   I read somewhere that Phillip Seymour Hoffman talked a lot about the sense that he hadn't done his Real Big Thing and that was after he won an academy award for best actor      I stayed in control   went to bed early to avoid another drink   It sounds to me like you're in a pretty good place  though  You recognized what you were doing and stopped it  I must admit  I don't think I'd be able to do that    Self forgiveness is so key  It looks like you've learned from your experience  and most importantly  it didn't ruin your resolve to keep working on your sobriety goals  Well done  Welcome  All of the success you see here  it's still a work in progress  and everyone has been exactly where you stand right now  There is no magic wand    you just do it   Easier said than done of course   You can do this  I won't drink with you today  Detoxing off of alcohol is no joke  Alcohol withdrawal can be deadly  so please be careful  If you are indeed withdrawing and are feeling as terrible as you say you are  please consider going to a doctor or to the hospital  For real   Thank you so much for your advice and book recommendations  I'll definitely check them out   I would like something like an acquaintance relationship with my mother   that's something I plan on working toward   Thanks again  Hang in there  my friend  I am in a similar boat  My girl left me too  I am still holding out the possibility that she will come back  But I won't let that stop me from beating this addiction  and neither should you  I am so sorry that you are hurting  You are one bad ass chick though  Do this for you  For the LOVE OF YOURSELF  We got each other  Never forget   Checking in This really is an upper to read  Fuels my fire to get to where you're at    Yay  Congratulations  D Checking in Wait   you can buy Kratom in head shops   I'm in Ohio  Thanks for the advice  I'm looking into AlAnon because of what you mentioned  navigating a relationship in spite of the drinking because I honestly don't know if she'll ever stop  Well I know that therapy is probably a step I'll have to take someday  or a support group  But at this stage in life I'm just not really ready  I have to take things at a slower pace  So I started here on this site as a first step  Ok  thanks Yeh exactly like that for me too  I would just drink again to forget the shame and embarrassment    but it always gets you eventually  I see work colleagues and other people drinking a few glasses of wine or something and being tipsy  but I could never do that  There is never a point where I know if I have another I will be falling about wasted   I just always would be  Most  days there will be half a beer or a couple of half bottles of beer other drinks lying in various places in the house  cause I will basically drink until I pass out  Its tiring living that life  Thanks for the check in  means a lot    I apparently fell onto my sons glass entertainment center and broke a shelf   Also bled all over his bed   NYE was ducking crazy  So now what do we do to implement it    you really need a dr  Agreed   cc    u newaccount21     don't let warrants cost you your life  I know that abrupt alcohol withdrawal can cause the "DTs"  delirium tremens  or the "shakes"  which can kill   But I've never heard any such thing about quetiapine withdrawal   Can quetiapine withdrawal really ever be deadly  Is he right  Do you need to work on yourself right now   If so  the best way to do it is to get completely sober  Start working out  Start drinking more water everyday  Read a book  girl  Go for a walk    You're on day 10  congratulations   so you're in the thick of withdrawal  The sadness is both the break up AND you not having your hit of dopamine that you're used to when you're slightly uncomfortable or bored  It's hard but just keep going  You're doing  great  so far     I would love for the distance to come naturally but with wedding planning she's going to ask so many questions and they'll be hard to dodge   Thanks for the advice  Just keep doing what you're doing   It's not only helping you but  it's helping everyone else on r leaves    Thank you for your post   You don't have to throw your XBOX in the trash  you can lend it to a friend until you think you're ready to moderate or you can sell it again  without losing much   I don't want to tell you "No  moderation is useless" because I fear that you might just go back to gaming  leaving all your good intentions behind  But I think it's not really going to work out  I truly believe that it messes GREATLY with your way of handling things  When you don't play and you don't waste your time browsing or watching TV or whatever I will promise you  you will go out  You will die because of boredom  You will find hobbies  you will find new interests  new people  you will change yourself in a way that you like yourself again  Use the motivation you have right now   As always it's just my humble oppinion and it's your life  But you already found your way here  and I  and everyone that commited to the detox  swear it is totally worth it    Any ideas on how to effectively do that  Awesome  Do you want a one year medallion mailed to you  I thought it was the addiction that we are trying to beat  if we're back to square one neuro wise  that still doesn't implies we lost all the time we have devoted till now  It doesn't work  imo  You can't really avoid the withdrawal  That would be like "avoiding the thc from leaving your system"  If you're gonna quit  it's gonna happen  But you don't die though   I've taken detox meds before and it is always the same  48 hrs of shit and then home free  Thank you for the support  I've been drinking so long  the first 48 hrs are always the worst  Thanks  You reminded me why I stopped going to 12 step meetings  Hell yeah  It just gets better from here  keep it up  Actually  perfect time to not smoke  It's easier to start new habits when a big change occurs in your life  You have a huge motivation right in front of you   that you'll become a better person  Hang in there  U are absolutely right  And thanks for keeping that fresh in my mind     Try  9  this time for me p I really did a number on my life too    I'm doing one sizable dose in the morning  then doing little doses throughout the day  the goal being to leave as much as possible for bedtime  Then I take enough to allow me to sleep and hit the hay  I'm hoping I'll keep getting to the end of the day with more than enough left for my nighttime dose  That's how I ended up only taking 19 grams yesterday  Today looks promising so far  I've read a lot about it being important to not dose too frequently  but I'm not gonna worry about that right now  My singular goal right now is the take as little as I can and get my average daily dose down  If I have to dose eight times a day but can drop my intake by doing that  I'm good with that for now    I don't know   Some websites say yes   But they also say hallucinations and other symptoms I'm not having  Good job making the decision to quit  I haven't made it to 30 days yet   18 actually   but I all ready feel 1000  better than when I was first starting this journey  This group has been the one thing that has helped me most  When I felt like I was going to lose it  I came here and just read post after post  Then I started posting my own story  Now I try to encourage everyone else  That last part is what has helped ME the most  By helping others  I am reinforcing my own desire to quit  Good luck  my friend  Stay strong    raises glass of water  To one day at a time   Dont care for them either  but ive seen enough friends die thinking they can stop taking heroin and do other opiates to 'beat addiction'   Yeah  loperamide is just tickety boo until you end up with a lump of clay in your intestine  I'll take the acid piss  You can do this  Weed destroyed my last relationship  We were together for 5 years  Got engaged  Everything was going perfect  Like out of a movie  Then one day she says lets try smoking  And we were an adventurous type so why not  We like it  Everything about it  Especially the sex  But trying it turned to daily use and eventually all we did was watch netfix and smoke  All the money we used to go out and do things wemt to weed  I realized this was not going to give me the life I wanted and tried to quite several times  I tried to get her to quite  But eventually every time I asked her is she wanted to do something she would say no  smoke a bowl and watch tv  It broke my heart and I don't think I'll everbe the same wothout her but I can't live that life  She became dead inside  cold  numb  The women I loved was gone  It's only been two months  I think about her everyday and wish things could be different  But the people we love should make us better  not worse  I hope you find it in you to hold out  I've quite smoking now  too  Onl a short time but I think about it everyday too  Best of luck  Let me know if i can help in any way    It has been easy since the start but I fear the future cause I know it's easy to fall back  But not today  today I wont drink with you guys  I Idid remove it  If you guys could report things that would be super great  It's hard to see but relief is in sight  Week 2 was the hardest for me  all fucking mental   but it got easier after that  Congrats bro  I haven't even made it to two weeks yet You're right   The only way is to go through it   I tried supplements  herbs  vitamins  but honestly found that what worked best was just to face what was happening head on   Accept it totally   Sit in the moment and think  "Man  this sucks "  Somehow that took the edge off for me   I'm not sure why   Maybe because it just put me in a position where I was no longer fighting what is   And once I stopped fighting  I found that "what is " whatever that happened to be  was doable   Maybe not pleasant  but I could stand it   What's even better is that over time  "what is" actually does become pleasant   It comes on so gradually you hardly notice it  and then all of sudden you're sitting there  without pain  without cravings  without kratom  and thinking that life is pretty damn good   That's a really good moment   Savor it   You're going to have plenty of moments like that    7" Congratulations Bad    You're rocking it   Hang on   is six inches actually average  Always thought that was a myth    feels proud and goes to measure willy  Holy cow  Nice work  Not sure about where you are but here  UK  the police would consider that personal use and they aren't very worried about that  You'll just loose it if they catch you  Besides if your trying your best to get clean and can prove it they'll likely want to encourage that   Giving you a criminal record will be no help whatsoever   Niggas out here be think'in that bitches don't know what 8 inches be looking like   Congrats on day 1  I couldn't imagine a day without drinking either  for a long time  In early sobriety  I just focused on each day as it came up  and had a plan in place in case urges hit  Stock up on your favorite NA drinks  LaCroix sparkling water is a huge hit around here   and treat yourself to some good chocolate or something  Best wishes  Dunno  but I feel like I missed some drama  It may actually be 5 5        I was feeling generous   I've seen more spoons filled with sugar than I care too    Thanks  Right back at ya Pond   I'm confused   Glad you posted  Hang in there  I've had this too  The disappointment I felt when I did it in my dream helped reminding me of why I do this    Cheers  Well  it's still early on  so I am still trying to figure it all out  I have been spending quite some time during these days thinking about what implications this addiction have had in the past  and how my future could look without any of those symptoms effects  That in itself is very motivating  Also  I would usually stay up way too late looking at porn  and start my days of tired and unmotivated  Having slept 8 hours for almost a week now has had a tremendous effect  which is no surprise I guess but nevertheless a great benefit  It gives me energy  which I certainly need for the task ahead of me  People on Reddit are assholes  I'm happy we're not like  r O or  r drunk  I wish we could combine this sub and  r watchpeopledie I love cannabis  even though it runs a distant second in my use as compared to booze  and I'm actually reverent towards the plant  but for me sober means sober  No booze  no smoke  no edibles  Nothing    I've been going to meetings for almost 7 years and I've been sober a little over 5 5 years now  There have been meetings that I've just loved and to which I have kept going back  it's generally the people in them that are great though some meetings are in bars restaurants and you can  eat awesome food during the meeting    some meetings have been so bad I've left in the middle and never went back   I really struggled at first with feeling like I belonged in meetings because the way people talked acted was too friendly or just too much  everyone was comfortable and happy and I was neither comfortable nor happy  I kept pulling away and I kept relapsing  I didn't like the idea of admitting I was am powerless over alcohol and I resisted for over a year   Eventually I figured out I couldn't do it on my own  couldn't  not take a drink  as bizarre as that sounds  and that I needed help  but wasn't the sort of person that asked for help   So when I finally did just surrender  and admit I was powerless over alcohol  some kind of magic happened and I never took a drink again  after another year or two I stopped thinking about drinking altogether   I don't know what the magic is  or how it worked for me  but something about being in a room full of alcoholics from time to time keeps me sober  I don't have to pay anything  I don't have have to sign anything  I don't even have to use my real name    but I do  because in AA I found a new honest way of living  and this is on top of relieving me of the obsession to drink  It doesn't work for everyone  and I've seen people appear and never return  maybe they found sobriety somewhere else   but it's the only thing that worked for me after years of searching so I keep going back  and I enjoy the company  and it's free    I will not drink today  Looking forward to getting my star in a few days  I will not drink today   A colloquial name for the Atlantic Ocean  Stopped dipping a few years back and went to snus  trying to get off that too this year  Picked up some of that ZYN pure nicotine salt 6mg whatever stuff for emergencies at work  Got up to a tin a day at my worst for dip  same for snus but the pouches and weaker portions helped me stay in control    Day 1 was easier since the NYE hangover kept me from enjoying the nicotine at all  Day 2 is a little rough gotta say  and I'm just trying to reduce intake until my tobacco nicotine free pouches arrive   For a second I forgot you could vape things other than weed   I was like umm   Congrats on 3 days  That'll be me tomorrow    I mean the fact that you're telling someone that their sobriety is wrong  If you're clean off your DOC and happy and your life is manageable then theirs absolutely no reason to change anything  I stopped going to NA because you do Kratom  you smoke weed  fuck you  you're not sober and it'll be just a matter of time before you're on the streets suckin dick for a hit of smack  Fuck that  I've been sober since March off junk and my life is incredible  But if I tell the people in the meetings I get flamed  Mo niggas got no right telling me my sobriety is wrong   Good job      I'm right behind you      I totally understand  We all have our own process to get where we need to go   and I'm glad that you took that first step of posting here          Post as often as you need   I post damn near every day   I quit two weeks ago and my body was sore but it was from all of my muscles tensing up since I couldn't stop heaving as my body was rejecting everything that I put into it  water included  I would have to drink water just to have something to throw up  So maybe different than yours   I also had sleepless nights  racing heart  panicky feelings  etc  I found that l theanine helped me a lot with that  A couple hundred mg a few times a day mostly did the trick  Didn't help me sleep but it calmed me down  You will be foggy but you'll be even foggier if you choose to drink again  A handful of days and you should start to "clear" up a bit in mind and body  Not drinking today  Phone your local head shop and ask   Or you could cab it to an emergency room   An emergency room visit will probably cost you at least  500   At least   You can arrange a gradual payment plan with the hospital's billing office  later on    Edit   Kratom addiction can cost a person some serious coin   If you want  you can go read a  case report  https   www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles PMC3670991   of a patient who spent  15 000 per year on kratom   Honestly  that does sound like it would be a concern to me  going to AA where your closest family members are strong participants   Can you go a bit further afield for meetings  You can also check SMART recovery or Refuge Recovery for meetings near you  On the other hand  having two people in your life with such solid sobriety could really be a massive help too  They could be valuable assets in your recovery  I also didn't have any serious legal consequences  but I did have some burgeoning health issues  My only regret is that I didn't get sober sooner  Best wishes  Thanks everyone  It is an accomplishment and some days I feel better about it than others but I'm going to KEEP GOING   How about Android     Please do   There's been a real lack of dick pics on here  I'm fucking not selling shit idiot  why should I when others won't  r cagonewild I miss it but have also forgotten what it feels like  Addiction is strange   That's really a personal preference  Some people announce it on social media  others tell no one  Please be respectful  It's against sub rules that link to sites that sell things I am so sorry to hear you are hurting so much  LatentDreamer   When I drank I often self harmed   I was full of loneliness and anger at myself   I hope that being sober will allow you to deal better with those feelings too  3  I won't drink with you today  I drank that much or a little more and quit cold  Your mileage may vary  It wasn't easy but I did it  one day at a time  I gained a few pounds at first because sugar was  and still is  a great way to make it through cravings for alcohol  Overall though I'm down 15 pounds in 3 months  It didn't drop right off at first  And I work out besides   Congrats  Good luck  You can do it  It will pass  You just   drive without smoking  To this day once in a while i will get an urge when I get in the car but it's like once a month maybe  Less than that  even  It just goes away  Wait that's not Zach Galifianakis   If you stop now  you have much less to worry about  Cops will often watch for a while before making a move on you   Time is a resource  They also strongly encourage donations  The founders of AA accidentally stumbled upon group therapy which requires a group and therefore new members  Not to mention recruitment is baked into step 12  I told my wife right away  my family a few weeks later  and everyone else as needed without making a huge proclamation about it    This is your app  Dude  It's the reason I made it this far  Thank you SO much for developing it  I paid for premium and it was worth every penny  You're saving lives  my friend  no problem  I love audio dharma  Gil has such a soothing voice and can be pretty funny in a dorky way haha same for Ajahn Brahm on YouTube  I like the insight timer app myself  Nice range of guided meditations  from a short 10 meta meditation to hour long Juana type stuff or just set your own timer and sit   I'd say my main source has been Against the Stream Buddhist Meditation Society  Noah Levine has written some books that really hit home for me  Refuge Recovery is their Buddhist approach to addiction recover with a book and meetings  Just finished his book on the heart practices  which was a big part of the puzzle that I was overlooking  Dharmapunxnyc is a great podcast too  Does a good job pairing clinical and scientific ideas with the dharma  Another tattoo covered ex punk rock junkie turned dharma teacher  Definitely check them out    It's been a pretty radical change for me  which I'm sure you can relate to  Instead of running away from every stressful  annoying  or sad emotion just kind of sitting with it and realizing "oh  my head  in fact  will not explode if I stay sober through this " Ya know   Link please  I've got 30 pounds to lose  Want some of mine   u timbf was never a great guy in my opinion     but paleblue always seemed chill   Lol I think they both  went off the deep end rather suddenly   I'm just glad it's stayng at  r O for the most part  I'm also glad we put out up with such a massive level of shit like them   Congrats   Keep on keeping on  The side effects are NOT overblown  In the US this medicine has what is known as a "Black Box  Warning in that it is quite dangerous    What happens is you either get them or you don't depending on your unique bodies reaction   Thanks  I am going to stick around and start some actual physical exercise as well    Great post  I am also looking forward to these benefits only on day 3 but the better sleep is awesome  The first event is a play up in Jacksonville  FL I'm from Orlando   Never been to a play before so I'm not really sure how much drinking is involved  Leaving if I'm uncomfortable could be a problem for that one  Timbf is a bro    I don't know enough about their drugs to really comment   I just feel like trying  to be the "bigger" addict is sort of self defeating    Like I don't think any of you are particularly great people   But that's why I like you   Keep going to the gym  Shed fat  Build muscle  Look good naked  Just to let you know  can't get properly erect right now   I have a chess game to battle   but I reckon 6 and a half  Veiny girth is what it's all about though  isn't it CA ladies            Side pro tip   When you take lope  always read and follow the label   Congrats on quitting  I would just say from my own experience trying to quit in the past and then coming back to drinking   as long as you feel like you're "missing out" or "depriving yourself of joy" by not drinking  you'll almost certainly go back to it  I did  I had to get to a point where it was clear to me that the alcohol drinking cycle was taking more from my life than it was giving before I actually truly wanted to stop  Anyway  that might point you in a different direction   you might need to really think about the trade offs and your mindset around deprivation vs  improving your life  I am not a medical professional  but I don't think seroquel withdrawal from that dosage is going to hurt you  I also think you might have screwed yourself over by relapsing    You also have learned the hard lesson that you have to look out for yourself   you have to be your own best advocate  No one is going to look out for your wellbeing more than you  In the future  do your own research on the medications you'll be taking before you take them  Seroquel is relatively harmless if you've not been taking it for a long time and you have to stop abruptly  How long have you been taking seroquel at this dose  Get outside and run until you aren't angry anymore   I wish I had better advice but that's what has been working for me     Ha I always thought bro was an insult for this kind of place l  Yuri always says birds of feather swarm poor lady in phone booth         I'm two months clean too  So glad I broke that cycle of not going to work if I was sick and only working to have dope money  That's not living homie   They would need to catch me  I think  They probably have been observing but I imagine with the intention of catching me one day and using their surveillance against me  But if I never go back then they never catch me and get a chance to use it   Any thoughts  Penis has never been and be all and end all for me   personally  But congratulations on the penis   I feel you on the loneliness  Drinking won't make it go away though  I'm sober with you today  and hoping things start going your way   Hi  thanks for sharing  Christmas and New Years is a really tough time for a lot of us in Al Anon  Especially tough because meetings can be cancelled due to community centre closures or church events etc   Please try to attend some more meetings  It's such a safe place where the people in the rooms understand and have been in similar situations     In Al Anon I first learned how to set boundaries to protect myself  Then I learned how to love the alcoholics in my life  I can't control their drinking and I can't cure their drinking   no matter how hard I tried   Today I was surrounded by family at Christmas   active addicts  dry addicts and recovering addicts  Al anon helped me separate the disease traits from these people  I don't feel controlled anymore or that they are constantly hurting me    "You will come to realize that there is no situation too difficult to be bettered and no unhappiness too great to be lessened "   Al Anon meeting closure no this is the usa   you know  where we have 5  of the world's population and 25  of the world's prisoners       and swarm we shall   Welcome  Sounds like a similar situation I was in  Good luck  stay motivated  Make sure you check in every day  that has helped me know I am not alone in this  Sometimes using moderately is more difficult than not using at all Don't smoke because you'll come out better  hotter  stronger  and happier   Then he will be like "shit  what did I do "  If he didn't stay with you through your worst   definitely doesn't deserve you at your best   Revenge can be sweet   Love to ya       I just needed to get a little drunk every night to unwind and forget the world  Not hammered  but enough to turn my mind off   I know exactly where you are coming from   You can do it  This place has been a huge help to me  Congrats on making a change  Your sobriety is wrong because it doesnt exist  Thats like saying your virginity is wrong because your having sex in a position different from missionary   No offense mate  I hope everyone who is an actual addict that thinks they can still take opiates and other mind altering substances is in that 1  who can do that forever without their lives becoming unmanagable again  Truth is  though  I still havent met anyone in that 1   So until then  I remain skeptical  just like the people helping me out were when I told them how great my life was smoking weed and taking kratom   I had a great life taking kratom  got into a great place and was there for a year    Mind you  i'm only speaking of addicts  If you arent an addict  then I have no fucking idea what you can and cannot do  If your an addict like me  and the ones i've met using heroin every day in the past  your likely going back to unmanagability with the mindset of being able to control opiates now  if you couldnt in the past   Thank you so much for sharing your experience with a year free and sober  It's amazing how much self reflection one can have when not under the influence of alcohol  I really appreciated reading your story and everything you've learned so far  I hope to be there myself some day  Always forget about that one I drank nearly a fifth a day for a long time but I won't give medical advice  I quit cold and it was hell for a few days  mostly at night  but I did it  I thought about tapering down but I didn't wanna taper down and then ramp back up  Woo hoo  Sometimes we have to learn the hard way  Thanks for the help  The timer  nail polish remover  and scheduled eating sound like good ideas  I see a psychologist but they aren't much help in this specific area  I have thought of self admitting somewhere but feel like I don't have time to do that  Thanks again  Thank you for sharing this   I need to remember what is in store for me if I drink  poor health   misery will be at the top of my list   I'm so happy to hear that you are doing better   Your strength and courage inspire me to keep going  Day 2 is the toughest for many people  Just hang in there    Try sipping fruit juice throughout the day for the next couple of days  There is a temporary drop in blood sugar when you detox from nicotine  That is the root of many withdrawal symptoms  like headache     But if I never go back then they never catch me and get a chance to use it   Exactly this     Sorry to hear you are also having this problem  Don't give up  you can change  I have been sober for almost 2 weeks now and I still have cravings  but having a clear sober mind  and healthy body is worth it  If you understood its not acceptable anymore  The same way with a lot of words  Believe me with my heritage it is a slur now  I'm not even kidding you when I say that I also was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis  ie  chronic diarrhea  at about 25  My future all throughout childhood was also seen as very bright  Then I made a bad decision in college  mothers  don't let your sons grow up to be liberal arts majors     which has put me back years  and cost me  I estimate in the neighborhood of  500k in wages I didn't make    But again  you're only 25  I've been transforming who I am professionally  and recently had an unsolicited invitation to apply to a dream job inside my same company  It's doing a role that was worlds away from where I was at 25  Do not give up  There is always somewhere in your life that you can make progress  If porn has you too beat down right now to make a good effort  pick something else  Celebrate  any  success  and use that to build  You will get to the point where you have the motivation to overcome this part of your life too    Also  if you don't feel able to do something poorly until you do it well  that's not perfectionism  that's a fear of failure  and it's holding you back   Same here     1 priority above all  Welcome   How awesome that you have chosen to retire from drinking at 25   I wish I would have done the same  I'll happily not drink with you today     I have read a lot of posts here where people got help from their doctor   It was a little rough for me just getting started for the first few days and weeks  Days went by where I went to bed early and woke up late  My body had a lot of catching up to do with rest  and working through what I had been pouring into it for far too long   Take it light  Tomorrow may be worse  But I am so glad I made it through the beginning because I am much happier now   Congrats  Not drinking today or the next 24hrs  Never a great guy  Why would you say that  I told my girlfriend and two close friends  Everyone else figured it out when I wasn't a drunken fool at Christmas parties  I think whatever you feel is best  is best for you  I felt exactly like you a couple months ago  During my nofap streaks I even had porn running on my left monitor while working at home  those were sad moments looking back now   Since I'm very much into self development  I listen to my body a lot when experimenting with new stuff  But you have to know  if you   think   that something makes you more enthusiastic or overall happier  it could easily be that you're talking yourself into things that are not true   Nofap was one of those experiments  over the months I realized that the only thing making me "happier" is the overflowing testosterone which gives me a huge boost in self confidence   As soon as I found out about pornfree  I experienced a new feeling  It was the feeling of being free of doubt and shame about myself  I was able to open up to my closest friends about the mobbying I fell prey to during school  which left me in a state of vulnerability and closeness to my friends  If I were the same porn addict like half a year ago  I would've just drowned those feelings and kept living a mediocre  'fine' life   Coming to an end  I consider masturbating as a tool of getting rid of distracting and sometimes inappropriate cravings  Even though I still enjoy the 'high' I experience during streaks of not fapping  it's fine for me to blow a load from time to time   Realize that pornfree let's you live a life where you create real bondings  real relationships with people you love  And believe me on this one  sharing feelings with other people is the most satisfying experience in the world  You cannot give what you do not have for yourself first  Use this time to improve yourself  When you cherish yourself  you will treat yourself right  and when you treat yourself right  you will be able to treat other people right as well    There are two parts to this  first of all  you get what you give  You described yourself as having "insane behavior"  If this is what you are giving  it is what you will get back  Either in the form of people pushing back and isolating from you  or negative people creeping into your life  People who don't respect you  people who abuse you  They show up because you allow them to  You allow others to abuse you only as much as you abuse yourself  This is why it is so important to focus on yourself first  When you become a fortress of self respect  those kinds of people can never break through  because you'll see them for what they really are  You have to realize that you are in control of the way you treat yourself and other people  and the way you conduct yourself dictates the kinds of people who will want to be around you   The other half is knowing that you are only responsible for your half  You can change yourself  you can improve and grow  and you can start to share the same love that you give yourself with other people  However  you cannot control whether or not they take it  or what they choose to do with it  You can never control other people  you can only control yourself   So these two things work together  When you love yourself completely  you will be able to love other people as well  You will also begin to recognize that not everyone will accept your love  and you will be okay with this  because you will no longer put your personal happiness in the hands of other people  and you will not let other people put their happiness in your hands   I hope this makes sense  I've learned these principles from various teachers over the years and it has started to make a different in my own life  in small ways that add up over time  Everyone has the right to be loved unconditionally  just the way they are  and that includes you  You are a special person  and there is no one else like you in the world  and there never will be   Rock on  Congrats  Really great post and idea   I think the major problem with the current badge system is that it psychologically kind of really encourages binging haha   I'm almost at a year and the first 3 weeks were the worst  But here is what kept me going   1  I went for a run every day  The first day I made it a quarter of a mile before I started gasping for air  The second day I made it a half a mile  The 3rd day I made it 3 4 of a mile  The next day I made it a mile and then kept running because it felt so good  Being able to feel my lungs heal themselves made a difference   2  about 4 months in  people started commenting on my complexion and how much better I looked  Knowing that quitting got me there made it even easier   3  About 2 weeks in I watched someone standing in freezing rain shivering to smoke a cigarette  I realized this wasn't me anymore  I no longer had to make myself uncomfortable just to cure a little withdrawal   Keep it up  it gets easier and I still get a craving every once in a while  but it now lasts for about 5 seconds and is gone   Deal with 1 craving at a time  I believe in you  Four years  Nice work  Yeah  I should have   I was in the Psych Ward when they started me  for suicidal ideations related to heroin withdrawal   It seems so counterintuitive to put me on something else that would give me withdrawals too  I was still out when they started me too  when I started remembering again  I was on a whole list of medications  and still sick   Once I was released  I had already been on 300mgs for 17 days      My life is so fucked up   I was okay on the Seroquil though  after trying everything  legal and not  to help the PTSD  depression  and anxiety  I thought I'd found something that would help   And I didn't even want the heroin anymore   Sometimes I could ride in the car at night without screaming from PTSD   I got through the nightmare phase and the Seroquil had me sleeping through the night  instead of waking up screaming sometimes three times a night  for the first time in years      How is Chief a slur  I'm guessing you're not a Kansas City Chiefs fan    I'm not sure what a first nation is but my brothers a native and so is Yuris sister    They don't act like they're the highest one in the totem pile when someone says Chief    But tbh fam xD id rather just avoid you and chill  you kinda seem on edge not like edgey but like on edge      year medallion mailed to you   No  it's cool  just bragging     Thank you  Lots of CA dicks Thank you so much for this feedback  It's helpful to remind me that sobriety is my main focus right now  I think for me it's so easy to become overwhelmed with making several different changes at one time  Appreciate the support     Good luck on the rest of your journey  You did make the right choice  It gets better  I'm in between 5 6 weeks of quitting now  and every day goes by a tiny little bit better  I used to smoke about 30 cigs a day  You can do it  and I believe everyone has the power to do it  Thank you for this  it gives me hope  You should be proud of yourself   Don't take it personally   the new crowd has turned this sub to shit    Used to be fun here    I sure hope so   I only count my days sober every 10 minutes  And you'll go to prison  nobody will give you a job when you come out and you'll have practically no motivation to stop using  My Auntie was a user in and out of prison and it did her no good  Thankfully we're getting some better services here now  There's always help available if you need it    People need support not vindication  Everyone deserves a chance to right their wrongs and become a functional member of society again  Society can be very judgemental about drug addicts but if it was someone you cared about you wouldn't see them as worthless or expendable   Time to nip that problem in the bud   I've been attending meetings on and off for about 2 years now   As someone else mentioned  mainly because it's ubiquitous  it's free  and pretty much everywhere    And at this point  I have my reasons for shying away from the program as well     However  my advice is this  don't give up  Give it a full chance by at least going for several months  get a sponsor  etc   Fully give it a chance  even if you don't agree with everything   The reason I say this is because a lot of the things you mention  valid points  btw  generally work themselves out    If  the program is for you  Sobriety is a state of mind  Caffeine and nicotine are drugs and they supply them at meetings  I'm not saying I can use and be OK  I'm saying me personally I've never been happy AA sober  I am an addict  I am also bipolar and suffer anxiety issues and left alone will snowball until I lose control of myself  Humans have been using mind altering chemicals since the dawn of time  It's in our genes to get high  I need something to control my mental issues  I self medicate  And when I use mmj and Kratom it works  I'm sober because I don't use heroin  I'm sober because my life is under my control  I'm sober because I'm happy with my life and don't need to run to a needle or bottle anymore  Weed helps  but I don't NEED it  I'm not going to rob and steal to get it   The  1 thing keeping me sane during sobriety  just before  r stopdrinking  is reading  You  sir ma'am  just added another book to my list  Thank you  You can get through this   sober  Best of luck  Well said  In the end we are all dust in the wind  I know I'm late but sign me up please     You are an amazing  strong woman for sharing your story  It's scary how plausible it is for any of us who drink  Stay strong    Thank you  every part of me aches physically right now  even my eyeballs are on fire   I want that clear mind so much  Good for you  you are doing great fighting those cravings off  Wooops 2 days late  sign me up pls    I am huge into tea and have been for many years  I can guarantee you  there is just as much culture  history and information for tea as there is beer  probably a lot more actually   Get yourself over to the tea subreddit and also check out some of these channels for good information on tea and tea culture    Information and tastings  https   www youtube com channel UCaHBABJFMRAtnKhQp2Cu5BQ https   www youtube com channel UC a4a88KhlXT554vo vgW2w  video blogs about visiting tea farmers in tea growing regions  https   www youtube com channel UCpu1G BZqoJhMEMGjl85B0Q Personally  I'm done with intoxicants all together   My habitual alcohol consumption as an adult was nearly identical to my habitual weed consumption as a kid young adult   I believe that   the     my   regular use of any intoxicant is equivalent to walking a path parallel to the path of alcohol abuse  It's just a different road headed in the same direction   I left that path on April 9th  2015 and I am headed in a different direction  I have no interest in going back    Are you sure you want to find out  You can't help her if she does not want help  An eating disorder is a lot like an addiction in a sense that depriving yourself of the very thing that every person needs to survive gives you a euphoric feeling and a false sense of self righteousness    You're in a rough spot  Unfortunately  your girlfriend's eating disorder will always come before you until she deals with the root of the issue  More times than not  it's not about self esteem  it's about control  Eating disorders are also linked to sexual abuse in childhood  Has she gone to counselling  Even then  opening up to someone you don't know about the most traumatic experience in your life is off putting  It's easier to live with your demons than fight them   I'm glad you posted   This sub has been a great safe haven for me as a mom who has issues with alcohol   I wish you all of the best that sobriety has to offer   I will not drink with you today   You can do this  I see you wango  I'm the same age and use duration more or less  I resolved to quit smoking and drinking for the month of January because I need to rediscover my ON switch for natural energy and mental sharpness  Working out has always been a very vital outlet for me  I couldn't recommend enough to fix your diet and exercise and it will make the rest of your month easier   I drank more than an hour per day so Im ok with one hour meetings    at the meetings I attend it's made clear there are no dues or fees but we all give  1 for rent and coffee  if I don't have cash  I just skip it and no one notices   eta  you and I have different experiences and understanding working the 12th step apparently  We can agree not to drink today Don't be too hard on yourself  Across multiple accounts  I've reset my counter here 33 times  All we have is today  I will not drink today   It is astonishing how I lied to myself when I was drinking  I never got behind the wheel drunk  but  I lied to myself about the level and intensity of my drinking  I am thankful every day about what could have happened and where I am  Every day  It may be your last  Nice way to spend NYE  Sucks that your board got stolen though  I have ridden quite a lot  I think I am done  First of all  great job  You are already through the thick of quitting    Make a pro and cons list for smoking weed  See how many more cons there are than pros   Keep journal  looking back at your "smoking days" can help from relapsing   Breakups are hard  I started to abuse the plant when my first girlfriend  and best friend  moved over 2 000 miles away for school  She found a new boyfriend in two weeks and I was devastated  I started to numb myself daily for almost 3 whole years  with only one 40 day sober stint about halfway through   All it took was one toke and I was back into the horrible place that is Marijuana addiction   You most likely feel like you're at rock bottom  If that's true remember the only way from there is up  Get into the gym  or just go on early morning walks  enjoy the fresh air  Take time to improve yourself  You will come out of this stronger than you were before   Trying to live life through the fog that is Marijuana addiction is just not worth it  As another member here said  'Stop feeding your bad wolf  and start feeding your good one   We are here for you and congrats on 10 days  Keep it up  I did listen to every damn word you had to say and it was terrific  Thanks for taking the time to lay all this out like this  In every post where people hit a year I hope to pull something from myself out of it and I actually see a lot of myself in this post  so it was very good to read  A LOT of similarities here    especially the BIG THING thing  you know    I also appreciated your comments on grass  I have unfettered access to some of the best of the best medical grade bud  wax  you name it that a person can get  college friends are investors and growers in Colorado  but I've had to make the decision that sober is sober  primarily because I'd ease down from a big high with a bourbon    which led to 10  FML  right  I think I'm actually happier this way   sober all around  that is    Anyway  I can't tell you enough how much I appreciate your story and the time you've taken to tell it and I applaud your year of sobriety  Well done  I have a half marathon scheduled for right around my one year  Right now I'm breaking in a pair of shoes to get my feet ready for the distance  so alot of short walk runs and calf stretches   I have a gym membership and a calendar wipe boar detailing what each work out day is going to be   Right  And even then  I was hammering it on my bike one time and a raccoon jumped in front of me  I am damn lucky I didn't hit him  I would have died  Yes  Yes it is  Day one for me as well here in Idaho   I can understand why the aa might be hard having family involved like that  I've done meetings before and it just wasn't for me   I'm going to just try to stay motivated and positive for my wife and kids and focus on being the best dad and husband I can be for them   Your post really struck a chord with me as far as no duis  health problems  etc  and always changing up stores to not get noticed   Best of luck and I am not drinking with you today    Eh  I'd rather jerk off than bang the low hanging fruit on tinder bumble  I need my free range organic nuts to be love filled lmao  Welcome   I will not drink with you today  Thank you very much  there is much wisdom in what you say   I couldve pharsed that better  I'm sure you're a stand guy there Chief    "You never seemed like such a great guy" would've been better   I've seen you around  r O for just over a year  a handful there constantly come off like jerks   still a great community overall  Will Do   I needed to read this tonight   right here and right now   thank you   I found it helpful to call someone in recovery as I was going in  and again on my way home    Always have a way to leave on my own steam  Even now it's a deal breaker    I've posted accountability threads   to the outside world it looks like I'm texting when I'm really posting   commenting here    I found there's a huge difference between drinking buddies and friends  Friends don't give a toss  Drinking buddies can get a tad defensive    I've become the person who leaves first  Ironically it's who I wanted to be when I was chained to booze and couldn't leave a venue until I was kicked out    Finally  It depends why I'm going   Ic I have a a valid reason I can go anywhere  But I ruthlessly avoid old situations hangouts  people    I stopped speaking to my good friends about five years before I stopped drinking so a bunch of folks didn't see or n is how bad it got with me    When in doubt  do nothing   First of all  overexercising will not make you more appealing  It isn't even the most effective way to not get fat  But more importantly  it is an unhealthy practice   Secondly  your behavior is not helping  Don't act like you're better than others  Those in relationships are not necessarily whores sluts  and if your offline behavior is really similar to your online behavior  calling people sluts on this subreddit   it needs to be changed   I realize this sounds a bit harsh  but I cannot word it another way  It wasnt about trying to be a bigger addict  It was about someone not knowing what he was talking about and refusing to admit he was wrong  even after a lot of people besides myself and tim told him that  And then devolving into rancid insults and psycho talk   I was just trying to pass along some harm reduction info  And i dont like being called a twat  half wit  and cunt by someone who is too stupid to admit that they are wrong about something  It's like his whole world would come crashing down if he did    So it wasnt about who is the biggest addict  Well done   I wasn't intending to quit for good when I started  but I am now and I credit this sub for helping me change my mind  I'm going to say this and you really need to pay attention to these two words  GET HELP   You can't do it alone  man  If you have a therapist  tell them about this goal and keep seeing them  You might also want to consider A A  You might not be the "drinking all the time" type of alcoholic  but trust me  not everyone who goes to A A  is either  You don't have to be dependent on it to be an alcoholic    As for your OCD  I know this is very flat and blunt  but deal with it  Those intrusive thoughts aren't going to go away anytime soon  as a matter of fact  they're probably going to be more potent than ever  You're going to be worried that your life is going down the shitter  You need to let yourself feel that right now  If you run from it  you'll latch onto something else other than alcohol  and I'm not even implying drugs  I know one girl who gave up alcohol  and then she went straight into porn addiction  Find out what caused you to clench onto the bottle and get help for it  Find out why you feel the need to constantly seek pleasure  Let yourself be bored  let yourself feel "normal" again  Find other  more constructive ways to cure your boredom   You're not alone  man  But if you try to fight this battle alone  you WILL lose  I wish you the best of luck  No   you didn't make it about being the bigger addict    he did with all his " faker   poser " comments   Yeah  that helps   Thank you' Thank you  I guess the hardest part Will be when my friends will start noticing I don't drink anymore   Social pressure is a bitch  but if I'm ever in this situation I'll pop up Reddit and check in   I'm going to read up on this  I am so tired of pain  It's a very good read  Your bout of pancreatitis sounds like his  Thanks  and yes I have been on this sub all day  its been great  Everyone posting best wishes has made me feel un alone for the first time in a very long time  And I have been given great words of encouragment I am  truly thankful  Me too   Thank you  I'll be checking in on you   Way to be man  I'm on the New Years resolution train as well and am feeling great  I've tried to quit a bunch of times in the past but never got past day 3  I got a vaporiser and I never want to put another cigarette in my mouth again  I even went to a gig last night and felt no desire to bum one   Stay strong dude   Thank you  1 week in and I'm not drinking with you next week either    Thank you  I think smoking could make you feel a lot worse   Not smoking for me makes me much stronger at handling emotions   You might feel better for a few minutes  but ultimately it could be a bad experience  because it won't bring him back  and now you've broken your resolution after a significant number of  the worst  days   I've never been able to drink without getting drunk   When I was younger  I just went out on weekends so it didn't seem so bad   But once I had a buzz  all bets were off   And I always had a buzz   Stopping drinking when I was just buzzed felt like I was missing out on something     Another hour down   how are you feeling  Its cool you have your opinion  But what are you basing it on  We have never talked  I have never even noticed you  And I wouldnt have unless you paged me   don't drink today   no problem   one way or another  it will be the end of the day   and you didn't drink   You have to have a plan for when you are face to face with it   A reason to say no  a reason to avoid that 1st drink   Closing in on three years myself  and first 2 3 weeks  sucks      Stick with it  do anything you can to distract yourself   It does eventually get better   I  hated  when people told me that because I didn't believe it   didn't want to believe it   But it really really does   Check out  r stopdrinking     it sees a lot more action than this sub  you will find wonderful support   Good luck   You are posting here for a reason  remind yourself what that reason is  I am down to 17 8X grams a day now  Split up into 4 doses    It was a little touch for my to keep in track but I feel confident now I can do this  I added black seed oil to my night time dose and I'm feeling 9 grams like I was at 15 grams dose   My question is now  should I stick to my schedule times to dose until I get lower on my daily doses  Or should I only dose when needed    I feel like if I we re to dose when I need it and still keep that scheduled daily amount it might cause problems for me or my body wouldn't adjust slowly enough to the drop  I can go almost an entire day with only 5 grams but I want to slowly ween down   I really just want to get low enough to be able to not have restless legs  I think k when I get to that point I'm going to try and jump ship  Or periodically only use 2 gram maontance dose to help ease the translation    What would be the best and more productive process for this   And does anyone know how low I have to be to not experience RLS No doom and gloom in my AA meetings   even the one in prison   As for powerless   why are you here    Seriously  if you have the answers  go for it      Not to argue  but in the beginning I had lots of "issues" with AA too   I got wrapped up in definitions   and especially the god thing   truth was a big part of me did not want to get sober  and I thought that somehow I was smart enough to do it myself     Turns out I wasn't   results may vary  I dated a girl who's dad was 20  years sober  even with that length of sobriety he struggled every single day with it  He had a routine that included meetings  prayer  meditation  etc  He woke up at 4 am every morning and went through a series of prayers that took 2 1 2 hours  he was praying to remain sober for the next 24 hours    it was really something  He had been through the 12 steps and this was his maintenance  I think I always believed this was what was necessary to get and remain sober    and who knows  maybe for some it really is  On the few occasions that I talked with him about alcohol he had an extremely defeatist view toward it    like it held some mystic power  I just couldn't  and can't get behind that  Like you said  its a drug    some people handle better than others  It took me about 20 years to figure out that I'm one of those people who can't control themselves once they start drinking  but I am also one of those people  I hope  that can learn to control themselves from starting to drink  As a fellow "non believer" I can't get inline behind the "succumb to a higher power" stuff    I can view myself as in control    until a chemical response makes me lose control  And thats that for me  Personally I used altoids and had a short stint with sunflower seeds  The oral fixation thing was my biggest problem  I don't use either any more but I used to keep a tin of mints right there in the car  Way better than dancing around to get lighters and cigs out of your pants while driving   or worse when you drop your cig in between your seat and door lol  I'm sure we've all almost died a couple times due to that fun perk of smoking  Thank you not sure if I get the point  Though so unless I can develop self love in a very isolated situation I won't find love from other people  I have had good friends  I never abused them or had issues showing acts of kindness such as rides to pick up cars or helping decorate  But as my high school friend put it and I have heard it repeated many different times  "I love you but I can't handle the mental health issues  I am scared you won't be around when I call one day so I would rather not call anymore " And maybe you are right either I just suck it up and straighten out or I don't really deserve to have friends because I hurt them too much   I find getting older and older that it gets easier and easier to pull those muscles  I stopped to pick so etching up the other day and had a shooting pain in my lower back that made me freeze for a moment  Never had that before  Growing old sucks  Ah  Ok  I'm glad you didn't think it was me doing that  I tried to stay as calm and civil as possible to highlight his bad behavior  too    Like  why would i lie about being a junkie  Its like bragging and saying i have herpes or something   Please sign me up  if it's not too late  Thanks  It's raining it's ass off today  Thank you fest  I just downloaded it  I hope it helps me too   cannot stress enough the importance of support   AA is full of people who know what you are talking about   Friends  family    maybe   They can be tricky    Therapist  yes  My experience has been similar to yours  Smoking on and off for more than 20 years  with breaks of 1  2 and 4 years in between    but always relapsing and falling back to something I actually hate  I hate the dependency most of all  And on top of it  smoking killed my father at 59 years    Today I'm 3 days in and the cravings are at a peak  but the endless cycle needs to be broken    I wish you strength and patience  you can do it   Does it cause you a lot of pain to pull from there  Could be a fight or flight response to the pain  but I am certainly no expert  I don't have that reaction when I pull from the same area  Sign me up  Thanks  So true  Although  my parents were never fooled  We are a unique corner of Reddit alright  Ladies     Lem is ready to disappoint you in completely new ways as a response to this post    PM me   Same here  When I was a teenager drinking I was always the one passed out in the park or someones garden  not much changed tbh  Physically I feel awful  but definitely not drinking alcohol  Think I will have one more cup of tea before I try sleeping  You have been a great help  really  one thing that has helped me when I get the occasional strong craving is just focusing on how positive quitting has been       I start going through the list of benefits in my head  heat rate is normal  blood pressure normal  no more sinus headaches every other day  no longer look emaciated and underweight  my nails aren't yellow anymore  my teeth aren't as sensitive  I don't smell like shit  I've saved close to  3K  food tastes a bajillion times better  running is easier  shitting is easier  breathing is easier  I sleep better  my sex drive has gone through the roof  I no longer spend all my time obsessing about my next smoke  etc   etc  By the time I'm done thinking of all that the craving has passed and I'm shocked by how stupid the impulse is   Thanks for standing up for me    Im cool if he knows me  OK he  thinks Im an ass  But to make this an assumption on  what   I just want to know the criteria he based it on  Like what formula  Ok then everyone wondering can check the daily vendor list in the kratom sub  Well done on 6   I won't drink with you today Actually wasn't too bad   Apparently we went to the next town to the bar that was open later than the one we were at   Shut that down after doing a bunch of shot skis   Not sure who the fuck was buying those   Then we stopped and picked up booze at one house and went to a party at my friend's house   Oh and I was making out with and fucked a 30 yr old boy that I definitely wouldn't have done but I was BO   And I fell on my friend's sons glass entertainment center and shattered a shelf   Got massive quantities of blood everywhere in the room and all over the bed   Felt pretty bad about that one  Let's hope we can something about it then  if not changing it  we could try to atleast provide an alternative   Also  thanks  That there are   Surprised I've never posted there Me too  I was just going to ask how you were doing  Thank you for keeping us posted  I am going to make more tea now  We can do this  Count me in today  Is bartending something that you're really passionate about  It just seems as though you might have a tough time staying the course handling booze all night with drunk people hollering at you   I think your friend would be pleased to attend a meeting with you  No harm in asking      I've only told my close family   friends  To everyone else I see in person  I just "don't drink" and that's all they need to know   It feels so much better  Instead of thinking about my next drink  I'm thinking about my next goal  On day 2  trying for a month  Feeling more energetic already  You could halve your dose in search of a happy medium  Haha no worries bud  yours just one of a few that I know are rather ummm unique members of  r O I lurk there waaaayy more than here A couple of things like  If I talked to a handsome boy  i'm gay  I couldn't hit on him or anything like that so I would go home and search for a porn star that looked like him  so I could imagine what his penis was like   ridiculous right  but that's something I'd do very often  Porn was the expression of my sexuality and I didn't want that anymore  Also  I wasn't studying as much as I need because I'd stop my study session to start a 4 hours porn session  After I was finished I had no energy to study anymore  My life was sinking  I'm going back on track now     ps  As I said  I relapsed 15 days ago  What I can say about that is  It isn't the same  You don't like that as much as in the past  I end up at 2 am full of cum in my body but I was feeling nothing  I had to do 2 more times so I could feel something  My penis was hurt and my soul was numb   I will not drink today Ask yourself what's more important  your sobriety or  disappointing your friends     17 days is not going to be long enough to cause severe withdrawal symptoms  I think you're going to be okay friend   Wow nice one    Hope to get there myself one day That's strange  I launched it and I have a lot of views coming in    I've read it twice and check the website for the cliffnotes of the liminal points often  I don't have one  I don't smoke marijuana    in meetings sometimes when the green chip is being given out someone will yell out "no weed " and I think "is that rule written somewhere " not that Ive seen   Having said that  I also don't take any medicines for colds or sleep that would be in any way intoxicating  I guess my point is  for me it's total abstinence but I don't judge or even think about others' sobriety involving weed     If I dare to risk everything again by drinking  that will be it for me  This I know   I'm glad you drive that point home so well   both for yourself  and selfishly for me too   While for now  today  I KNOW that I cannot drink  it seems like the kind of thing I could forget in the future   Saving your posting among the few that I plan to read over and over if ever I find myself in doubt   Thank you    Fash   you my love have the best herpes   3 Awesome  Good work  I rearranged the furniture in my house to give it a different feel from when I was smoking  Getting rid of old environments and altering existing environments can be a real help to quitting  I feel our physical environments and memories have a more powerful impact on our current mental processes than we realize at times  Don't be a coward     DicksOutForCACivility    u timbf   124  was never a great guy in my opinion     You could NOT be more wrong  He is a great guy    I don't usually get involved in shit like this  but I refuse to see him shit talked about  I will not drink today   I know it's tough    Your drinking behavior has a lot of parallels with mine  The hiding bottles around and drinking room to room hit close to home  Drinking everyday  I did those types of things also  I'm not trying to compare our problems  just trying to show you that your situation isn't 100  unique and that there are people who have been and are still dealing with the same stuff    First off  it's good that you made this post  Coming to terms with alcoholism with yourself and others is one of the hardest steps in the recovery process  It's an accomplishment  Don't sell yourself short here    What worked for me in the first week or so was immersing myself in reading this sub and going to meetings  I know a lot of folks here aren't big on AA but I'm just telling you what worked for me  YMMV   Coffee became a pretty big part of my afternoons and evenings    Sleeping was rough  First few weeks of sobriety basically ruined my chances of drifting off  My mind would just race and race while I laid there  Melatonin supplements helped a little bit but it took about 3 weeks to be able to just go to bed normally    After that it's been just going through the motions day by day  There's bad days and good days    4 months in  and I feel a ton better  You will too  Some sense of normalcy has returned  I can  sort of  be out and around people who are drinking  It's altogether easier today than it was 3 months ago    What I'm getting at here is that it's s long road ahead but it's not that bumpy of a ride  Use the resources at your disposal  Read up on it  talk to people  drink coffee or tea  Do ANYTHING you need to do to pass the time when you are having a rough moment  Eat ice cream every night lol  You're saving the calories from the booze anyway  and if it helps you deal with the "reward" part of your brain that is lacking from the drink  you should do it    Most importantly is to talk to people  It's really hard to tackle this by yourself  People in AA or other groups  just like the people on this sub  are some of the kindest folks you'll ever meet  We all want the same thing for ourselves and others  and it's genuine  We are all in this together    Good job making this post  It's tougher to admit to your problem than you are likely giving yourself credit for  I wish you the best of luck  I'm pulling for you  and if you're ever having a rough moment where you feel like picking up  come to this sub  Chances are someone else is dealing with the same thing at the same moment  You will find strength together   I slowly began to notice that it became a replacement for real sex and love  Porn is like a whore you can call over whenever your horny  who gives you what you want and that is basicaly the reason why I didnt do anything about it for so long  because its so easy to have  whenever I was about to talk chat with some girl no matter if she was looking for a relationship or just for casual sex  these cravings would pop up in my mind  "come on it can be so much easier"  "I got everything you could possibly ask for" and while that is the case porn doesnt actualy satisfy  it doesnt fullfil you  its just a temporary sexual high that still leaves you feel empty afterwards and then you crave it again  Its the desperate attempt to fill emotional and sexual emptiness  but porn can never do that  it just makes these feelings even worse  it prolongs the suffering so to speak  And thats why it needs to end  I have to learn to accept and endure the suffering of being alone and unsatisfied and stop using porn in order to numb myself from it  I will manage to get to 30 days now  its my destiny and then Ill slowly start to search for something real again  I have no idea      Not worth thinking about    You know how many people don't like me here    Give no fucks   Yay  One day I can say that too  I know this sounds trite  but honestly one day you'll look back and be thankful for the tough times  When the heats turns up  big changes follow   Head down  eyes forward  I'm with you on the caps thing  It might not be precise  but it's a good guage for you to taper with  Good luck  Glad it wasn't too bad  Did you have someone look at your butt  professionally speaking of course  Did you need any stitches  She's a addict  We hide and lie as a way of life  Come clean to her  and let her decide if she wants to open up or not   Edit  forgot to mention to be nice  She's probably in her own personal hell if she relapsed  It's literally one of the worst feelings I've ever felt  and I feel it repeatedly   It's really fucking hard to not be in control of your own brain  What's the green chip   Because your nicotinic receptors are not yet normalized  Depending on how heavy you used to smoke it could be anywhere from 4 weeks to 8 weeks  This is of course the numbers for those who aren't using aids   Hang in there  You suffering for the next 3 months is not as bad as you suffering chemo or having to not be able to do things as a result of CA    Day 1 for me   Stay positive  You can do this  I won't drink with you today   Thank you so much for sharing this with us  I'm certainly glad to hear that something worse didn't happen to you and others  but I am very sorry for the pain you have suffered   Congratulations and a job well done on 100 days  Keep it up  Wow thank you I never considered that it could be helpful  that makes me feel good  I will definitely be reading on here  I never even knew this sub exsited before today  but I am so glad I found it  I dont feel as alone as I usually do  Good work on 9 months  Im going to try AA as well   Yeah Tim is good by me  It means you're a round doughy deep fried sweet treat  Just joking  It just means you've done something stupid  Chose not to tell anyone because it seemed doing so would add failure inducing pressure after the initial euphoria of confession was gone   Plus I'm prone to use "disappointing others" as a reason to pour more of that damn shit in my face  Everyone is different though and good luck searching for your own brand of strength  Way late to the game and others have mentioned it already but yes  the way you feel is normal   I was told every sinner has a future and every saint has a past  You were given grace mercy because you do deserve it  Don't squander your inheritance   Also  make sure that 4th column is solid  that is your map for the 9th and life   Daily check in  reading posts  chipping in when I feel I've something to add  It's kept me sober for 12 months now and long may it continue    No   not alone   I cannot stand how slowly the days seem to drag on   Sometimes I think my badge counter must be stuck   FWIW   I've read that we have to give it at least 3 4  months  some say a year   But in the meantime   I haven't found my way to Fun City yet  I used lope to get off kratom  It's very bad for you in high doses  but I think it helped on the 5 days I was on it  30 mg is WAY too much for your heart  Try 10mg and taper down 2mg a day  or see a doctor cause I'm just some random internet stranger  Thank you  I'm more the tech side  My friend is the expert on the behaviour change side of things   I'm so sorry  That is a heart wrenching situation  I don't personally have advice  but you can also check out r AlAnon  They've helped me in the past  Best wishes    I can't imagine having to get off lope  At least kratom got me feeling good  Lope is a great tool  but it's no joke  I'd love to do a half marathon  hit a higher total in my powerlifting meets  and go mountain biking more frequently  Maybe try a mountain bike race  Good luck on your goals  Hey  Runescape was one of my big addictions too  One of the reasons this game is so dangerous is because of the monotonous tasks you need to perform to get "max" experience per hour  Slipping up  as in getting distracted by REAL LIFE  is detrimental to your experience rates   The problem with this was even when I was at school  or at work  I was always thinking of how I'm losing out on experience  In turn  I wasn't living in the moment and always wanted the day to be over so I could get home and click away at rocks or trees to get a virtual cape after 3 months   End this addiciton  It will only lead to burn outs at which point you realize how wasteful your time has been spent  After a while  though  you're bound to come back  so pick up some new hobbies and work on your real self  and gaming will seem incredibly insignificant    because it is  I have never drank so much tea in my life  around 10 cups of tea with honey and tea with sugar  I want this so much I just need to remember  one day at a time  Thanks for checking on me     Didn't have anyone look at it   well I sent Lem a picture   No idea how deep because I'm scared to examine it and it's crusted shut with blood   I slapped a little neosporine on it and a couple of bandaids   It's probably fine  I believe it is possible  but we need to make some changes to the app first I think due to the way Google have implemented promo codes   Immodium is the brand name  Lope is generic  I've found I smoke much less now I'm not drinking  I guess I have found I like being present and don't want to switch off as much any more    Fantastic post by the way   Hehe  I hadn't heard that term before    Good luck  I am 27 and smoked daily for about the past 8 years as well  Maybe 2 or 3 breaks of the 3 month variety as you mentioned  Today is my first day so feel free to message me if you want support  I would try not to beat yourself up if you want like a cup of coffee haha but just keep weed as the top priority to quit  You can do this  I'm gonna climb a lot and hopefully reach the V5 V6 grade  or 6C in Europe  during the spring    Excercise wise     10 consecutive wide grip pull ups   50 push ups   10 dips   more focus on core and the quality  not quantity  of reps and sets  I hope to lose about 10 pounds too  If I stop snacking w  junk food and get to my previous sober training routine these are all possible     Yep   I thought break time at work was going to be the worst  but today it wasn't too bad    The actual worst thing is sitting at home on the computer   I live alone and was accustomed to smoking indoors   Now every five minutes I have to remember that I can't have that cigarette   I'm determined  though   I've got some carrot sticks   I'm going to have to take more walks  though  Spontaneous lung collapsed sounds terrifying   Glad I'm a thick woman  Checking in  I just read both over the past few days and actually preferred Carr  but they're quite similar  Mine does too  I've been out drinking with em and even brought my pint out of the bar to drink with em whilst they smoke  The only thing that's allowing you to let it affect you is you  Either that or help them stop too without forcing em  Everyone in my house smokes  my business partners  my clients  my staffers  the security guys at the guardpost before entering my workzone and every random guy smoking every 10 feet  because Malaysia   It's all you buddy  You can do it  Just take it one day at time   My dick is like 6 and 1 2 inches and every chick I've fucked bleeds and screams because of the girth  Kind of a bummer  Also it looks like a thumb sticking out of a blueberry bush when its soft  I'm about 40 hours in   It could be worse   The worst part is forgetting how determined I am to quit  and then my brain pattern follows that familiar road to the point where   it's almost a physical shock re remembering over and over that I will not smoke a cigarette  We are all made up of so many layers   I know that I'm most tempted to drink when I peel back another one   It sounds like you know you made a mistake  and don't want to fall back into that hole   I'm wondering what you learned and might try differently next time  If it's not red or itching by now  you're probably okay  It is nice  although I'm still worried about having to explain myself in more one on one situations  We were all drinking out of cups that you can't see through so no one even knew I didn't have a drink  Only me and my boyfriend   No  it had been seventeen days when I left the hospital  Its been four months now    Thank you though   I appreciate the good wishes  My SO is continuing to drink as well   I don't know how this will end for us   You can do it  the first month for me was annoying  Try eating some more carbs and protein  it helped me feel more normal  Beer has a lot of carbs so if it's suddenly taken away you're gonna be lacking a bunch of carbs you normally have which provide some energy and sugar  I found that eating a few slices of whole grain bread in the morning and whenever I feel a craving helps me   Don't be afraid to go wild on caffeine for the first month      Also water   tons of it  I was doing like 72 144 oz a day in the beginning   sooo much pee  Good luck  it only gets better  Or when it falls between your legs and rolls under your crotch   That is dangerous  What a post  thank you so much  You are right  and it wasn't until I had family round for a barbeque one afternoon and we all had drinks outside but I had my extra drinks inside as well that I even thought it was a problem but still I just told myself that was just me and I liked a drink  no big deal   Im trying to remember what normal even feels like  its been so long Im scared I won't even like it compared to the drunk  hazy feeling I have gotten used to  But I have spent all day on this sub and on the tips page so I know I need to keep busy through these first months and I really hope I can do it  I really want to    I agree  I think the gym  or any workout  is a wonderful place to be  I workout 3 to 4 times a week  I feel much better about life    I glimpse some of the same issues I have  and see how other people deal with them  it gives me the chance to learn new ways of getting to the end of the day and also what pitfalls lie ahead     Having never done this before I find the whole "not drinking today" statement a massive boon  I suspect this is a well used adage but it was new to me    Workout  eat better  live better  This is what nicotine has done to you and you need to heal proper before you reap the rewards of smoking emotionally  You might be physically better by any lengths right now but definitely get some workout done  eat food that promotes feel good compounds like dopamine  Read up on what nicotine does to your brains and understand what you are going through now  It will help plenty    Whoever diagnosed you as depressed   anxious 1 week into quitting  provided that you weren't prior  needs to get his qualifications checks  Otherwise  my apologies  What is your daily routine like  What are your sources if you were to pry deep enough to feeling like this if nicotine weren't a factor    Humans are amazing creatures  We're built to withstand adversities of any length as long as we can breathe  What matters is breathing long enough to conquer everything that plagues your mind  Good to see you around here Scott  Hope you're well  Wish you the best in 2017  I don't like to paint a black and white picture of the way the world is  or the way that you are  I didn't mean to imply that you might abuse your friends  the truth is  I have no idea what you're like   You don't have to stay isolated  but you should work on understanding yourself  and deciding what beliefs about the world  and about yourself you want to keep  and which ones you want to let fade away    Speaking from personal experience  I had a horrible long distance relationship in my late teens  It was built on a foundation of manipulation and lies  and didn't last for very long thank goodness  Who was really responsible for that  I was  I let someone else put their happiness in my hands  It was my job to make her happy and to keep her happy  If she got mad she blamed me  and I accepted that blame  I had some very powerful beliefs about myself and the world  that I wasn't even aware of back then    Looking back  I've come such a long ways  I've become more spiritually healthy  and more aware of the things going on in myself  There is still a long ways to go  but that kind of person could never plant those seeds in my life now   That's why I stressed the importance of working on yourself  at least for me  seeing those damaging beliefs and working on them allowed me to see what healthy friendships and relationships should look like  It doesn't mean you have to stay isolated until you develop this perfect version of yourself  Honestly  that vision will probably never be realized  We are all human  we make mistakes and we are imperfect   Like I said in my other post  there are two pieces  One is how you treat others  If you treat them with disrespect and abuse  they'll turn away  You said that you have good friends and you don't abuse them  great  The other half is accepting that you can only control yourself  If people "can't handle you" the way you are  then that's okay too  The world is a very big place  there are all sorts of people out there  and I promise you  the whole world is not intolerant of you  Treat yourself with kindness  and treat others with that same kindness  and let them do with it what they will   Unless this is a new account aren't you part of the new crowd   Don't then   I didn't go  I have a friend that does and from what she tells me about it  it isn't for me  It works for her so that's great but I've just used this sub and the sheer hatred I have for my drunken self to get through   I personally never had a problem with it  I smoke weed like normal people drink  For me it has a definite threshold for how much is fun or medicinal  Where as drinking did not  What I mean by that is I can take a hit and feel great the rest of the night and I probably won't even think about weed again  When drinking it always felt like I was trying to get through this drink to get to the next  If 5 beers is fun 10 is going to be great right  Then I'm waking up the next day and I missed work  have no idea how much I drank spent ate  feel like shit and hate myself  None of that has ever happened on after smoking   It ain't the meat it's the motion That makes your momma wanna rock It ain't the meat it's the motion It's the movement that gives it the sock  Blood pressure will spike for a bit once you stop entirely  It took a month to get mine to go back down  Mine was in the ballpark of 170 110 when I stopped  Doctor recommended that I keep track of it at home and after a month of no drinking it was down to 125 88   Therapists are confidential  meaning you can tell them anything and then never even have to see that person again  I think it could be good practice for you to open up  Welcome  You got this  I won't drink with you today   I'm 12 hours into day 1 and have to go back to work tomorrow as well   Hang in there man   Pming it to u now Oh    no   Been here like 2 years   Absolutely     As it is now  she asks to speak from time to time and as long as she is in a good space  I am happy to share surface things with her   It's not perfect  but it works   Best of luck  People here are incredibly supportive and their stories inspire me    And the daily check in is a public promise to myself for the next 24 hours   It depends on your mindset about it  since everyone is different there is no right or wrong answer    Personally  eating becomes the hardest thing for me and the only way to ease the nausea symptom is to get used to eating without smoking   It's uncomfortable but worth it to not feel dependent on weed to have an appetite or not feel like puking after every bite     If you want a point of reference  I suppose I "tapered off" in an unplannned way since I decided to not buy anymore once my stash was gone   Of course I wanted it to last as long as possible so I was smoking a little less each day until it was finally gone   So on my "last" day I basically was down to one bowl pack that I smoked before bed  and then that was it   I felt pretty terrible for about a week  but there were a lot of ups and downs  sometimes I felt fine   I went 11 days with no weed at all  and on day 12  New Years Eve  I smoked a joint with a friend   Two days later I have no uncomfortable symptoms really     Long story short  I would suggest doing what feels right for you without getting caught up in whether you're quitting "the right way" because the process  and yes  it's a process   will be different for everyone    Two months is awesome man  Glad to hear about the lungs    looking forward to when I quit coughing up junk  It's been a long time for me  I wasn't there in the moment when I did because of the contributing factors  I've had to pretend not to exist for the last 4 months because of the people in the flat above  listening to them kicking the crap out of each other every day    I'm pretty bloody tense  It was a bottle I didn't even know I had  I'm guessing I hid it from myself before and wanted to stop  I  can't stop tidying  that's good  I'm fairly sure there's nothing else to discover that is harmful  So  no next time  Everything else from the bottle went down the sink  Still can't take the recycling out though  so that's here for another 2 weeks     I think it's the time of year  the person that helps me has been unavailable  and them in the flat above have been in 24 7  I have asked this same question   and many others   to myself  which has been a barrier to my attending meetings and entering the program  I do attend meetings sometimes but I am not a true believer  I always feel like I'm on the outside  judging the others   I don't feel my life is unmanageable nor do I believe that I am powerless over alcohol  but at meetings I hear people repeating these things constantly  "I am powerless over alcohol  My life had become unmanageable " in addition to other things I disagree with  such as the idea that it's a disease and that I'm sick  I especially hate to hear anyone label themselves as "sick " which implies that anyone attending AA is sick too  Do I need to kick myself more when I'm down w labels and talk of powerlessness  Yeah  I saw it had been a month  but I just found this subreddit and I'm so happy that I did  My bf was very understanding in the beginning and was coaching me through the whole thing  But he was also an extreme perfectionist and he wanted too much progress too fast  It was probably not the only problem  but it contributed to his decision  And to be honest  I understand that someone wouldn't want to be in a relationship with someone who's a picky eater when he can look for someone who's way more easy  I'm wondering now how I'll ever be able to be in a relationship  because the people who can deal with this kind of problem are rare  I guess  So your gf should be really happy you informed yourself and are patient and kind about it  I hope that if things get difficult for her  she does seek help  I can say that only one new food on the list really feels amazing   Go Giants  Go YOU   Congratuwelldone on day one  I remember mine very clearly  If it gets tough and you need some support  let me know  Sometimes what happens can be a bit scary  So definitely talk to us  Casually smoking is what made me lose a whole seven months of progress  It went from one or two cigs a day to a carton a week    You got this though  Why not make it even easier on yourself   Forget about thirty days  just promise yourself you won't smoke today   Then  tomorrow  promise yourself you won't smoke tomorrow     If you really get a terrible urge then you know you can smoke tomorrow  and the only amount of time you need to hold out is the rest of today   Much easier than trying to muscle through thirty days  right  If you have trouble giving it up  you're addicted  I can only talk about quitting smoking  but cold turkey was the only thing that ever worked for me    Welcome   I've found taking things one day at a time to be of real benefit  I start each day by promising myself that I won't drink that day  I've done that for the last 360 or so days in succession  Wear a bacini to the pool this summer at 40 years old  This is very typical  The last time I made it two weeks I was 175 110 for about three to four days straight  The anxiety will also drive up your BP for a while  If you are concerned about it it wouldn't be out of line to contact your doctor or visit an urgent care clinic to get a short run prescription for blood pressure medicine until it drops back down   Probably safest for you right now  It was very tricky for me when I had early sober times  I would relapse quite easily  I can't count the number of times I made a month or two and then relapsed for sometimes pretty stupid reasons  Hence my strict "absolutely no alcohol in any way  for any reason  ever" mandate  that I have lived by the last 2 years and change  And why I am nervous about relaxing it to allow eating food with alcohol in it  My alcoholic inner self can talk me into drinking again with very weak justifications  I know this for a fact   Good luck and be careful   And I will not drink with you today  I have a crazy amount of respect for you  suh  Keep on doing what you're doing and being a great example for the rest of us   3   EDIT  You've been watching Westworld  haven't you  Don't you mean two pickled  Or to pickled  Thanks   Every little tip and bit of experience helps  The thing about porn is it can be very hard to measure a relapse   Does looking at a NSFW image count as a relapse  What about looking at NSFW images for 2 minutes  What about looking at a sports illustrated swimsuit video  What about looking at porn  but just for 20 seconds and then catching yourself and turning it off   It's kind of a scale and hard to measure at times what constitutes as a relapse          I really like your idea though  It may be an even better model for NoFap because that's very easy to distinguish a relapse          Excellent OP though  Maybe it can have steak count  relapse count  and then "percentage clean" count  etc  so 3 numbers  The only thing I have is today  and that I only borrow  It is given to me when I wake and taken away when I fall asleep at night  I want to remember it  I won't drink with you today   I took valium for 10 days to deal with my withdrawal and that helped so much   I'm 2 months in and I feel alot clearer but I do get the feeling of smoking after the tolerance break  Might wait and only smoke on 4 20 I have not noticed a statistical relationship myself  though the culture i'm in  England   Its the norm to have a relationship with alcohol in some way  and I feel like especially when young there is a bad pressure to drink as much as possible as thats the only way to have good time   I've met less than A handful of childfree people  and this was when I've been to meet a group of them so I can't really comment on the statistics of childfree people  Though at a guess I would say childfree might be more prone due to as you said DINKs    I'm quite frustrated by the cultural pressures with alcohol  though the childfree thing does not effect me much  as no one talks about it  Though I have been asked a couple of times  and one even thought that it meant i hated kids  which Is kind of a strange leap to make  Not much of an answer but felt like saying something  That sounds really similar to how I wind up in picking spells  If I'm not busy  then I tend to start picking or mindlessly eating  all  great  coping strategies for boredom and anxiety lol   I don't think it's all that bad actually  The people who tend to be like that are usually newer people that don't stick around terribly long    I really don't see much of a problem with what you mentioned  If anything this sub as a whole glorifies drinking and addiction a lot less than it used to   I'm guessing there's some kinda background drama you have going on since you call CA stuck up in other subs but this is like the least stuck up sub I've seen  Thought of a few more that I see regularly    "How do I tell my friends I'm not drinking"  "Can I still go out with my friends when they're drinking and I'm not"  "How do I stop drinking when my SO still drinks "   Well hang in there my friend   I'll not drink with you today  Well  the ability to log cravings for me was the absolute key  Instead of thinking about grabbing a smoke  it gave me a substitute behavior  logging cravings  It was what did the trick  I quit cold turkey  I choose every day to avoid drinking  I don't worry about yesterday and tomorrow will take care of tomorrow  Today I also will not drink with you  If you are drinking past eight drinks on a regular basis and blacking out  I think you know the answer  Of course you should be worried  Normal drinkers do not experience blackouts    I downplayed my own problem and joked about my own "time travelling"  "every drinker forgets a few things once in a while" I said  This is definitely not true  Blacking out is a serious and dangerous event  Many people wake up in hospitals and jails and do not know how it happened  Take good care of yourself  you can stop drinking if you want to  This is a great place to start  I spoke with a counselor   She recommended meetings   I went and got support from people who understand  got tools  resources and fellowship   I've not looked back  I always feared going to an AA meeting   I'm quite ashame of myself and I want as little people as possible to know about this  Also I feel like this would put to much pressure as if I ever choke I would live with the fact that not only let down myself  but also all the people at the meeting  An AA I once knew did gave me the bible tho  so i'll start with that   Will be keeping this in mind however  and if I can't make it on my own I'll certainly give it a go  Thank you and sorry for my grammar  english is not my first language  Well  to paraphrase Freud  sometimes a headache is just a headache  but have you tried neck stretches   I used to get terrible tension headaches  but once I started doing neck stretches they magically went away    thats why im here  the anxiety and depression and lethargy of a constant hangover is the most boring hell Woot  Thanks     I spoke with a counselor   She recommended meetings   I went and got support from people who understand  got tools  resources and fellowship   I've not looked back  Great    Sober On  I spoke with a counselor   She recommended meetings   I went and got support from people who understand  got tools  resources and fellowship   I've not looked back  You clearly don't know me or my history here    Cooooooooooooooooool I spoke with a counselor   She recommended meetings   I went and got support from people who understand  got tools  resources and fellowship   I've not looked back  A traumatic thing to witness  that's for sure  Like others here I was just in a sober car accident and was so relieved to not have been drinking  A minor inconvenience could have been a fucking nightmare  Be grateful and take it easy  Well  I'm only five days in  so I'm not much help    but I have had dry periods before and in October we went to a birthday party at a brewery and I wasn't drinking  Of course  everyone noticed  and I answered honestly  "I've been drinking too much so I need a break " and literally no one believed me and they all thought I was pregnant  There are a long list of excuses white lies listed elsewhere on this board that might help both of us get through this tentative early period   Haha that's funny  My body is pretty weird and can't handle nicotine but just the action is helping me not be so bored One year as of January 8th    No alcohol   Yay     I find something similar  I think a big part of it is that I'm more focused on what's going on and not zoned out into a pornographic fantasy world   It's almost like I go unconscious looking at porn   That's what it is right  An escape   a way to forget  for some of us    Check out the death grip too  I got rid of this and masturbation   intimacy with girlfriend   orgasm is much better now too   Basically the "choke my dick and stroke really fast" method  ain't necessarily the best  lol   Some people will argue they don't even need fantasy   IDK     Not sure yet   Sometimes I use my imagination to get close and then I just focus on enjoying the sensation at the end   It's really nice like you say   For now  I'm still gonna use fantasy   I need a little sugar in my tea  what can I say   D Yeah the fear is the worst part I feel like  It doesn't hurt the most but it's what makes me need another drink the most    Easiest thing is to just quit cold turkey or taper down a little bit and then 100  abstain from there and just stay on benzos for a few days  Doesn't completely remove the fear but makes it way more manageable   Patiently waiting     What was your other username   Haha I think lope taper is a good idea  assuming you don't overdo it  I'm actually thinking about skipping my last 2 kratom doses  Or taking smaller doses like just 2g instead  I really haven't had any wd symptoms the past few days  I seem to just take kratom as a psychological habitual addiction rather than to stave off wd  Wondering if o should try an immodium taper the next few days instead of pursuing my kratom taper    From someone who has been there  Albeit at a lot younger  this is what I did  I looked at every dollar I had  and I checked myself into the best rehab that I could  for as long as I could  I burned through a lot of insurance money  It cost me a lot but my sanity was worth it  I stayed for 60 days  And the last 20 days  I had to pay out of pocket for  But it was worth it  After I got out  I did intensive outpatient  My job was really awesome in that they let me work half days  I had to go in at 2 in the morning  but I was able to make it work  After I got out of IOP  I had a meeting every day  It was hard  But I've been sober almost 2 years  You can do this  It takes desperation  and determination  It cost a lot of money  but if you talk to your wife  I'm pretty sure if she's going to be okay with spending it  in order to save you and your marriage  I work in insurance  If you need help navigating health insurance  please DM me  What helps me most in the daily check ins and the fact that SD is resource in my pocket  which has saved me many times when I'm out feeling vulnerable    I also like the sense of community  and the sense that I'm not alone in this and that  while you guys may not know me  you are here to help me fight   Like    too many too list    Jax is all you need  Either you know the name or you don't   Hey how are you doing right now  Still not drinking  You gonna be able to hang in here with us  Just take it easy    one minute at a time  That's what it was like for me anyway  I was so happy when I first realized I could go for 12 minutes without thinking about drinking   Hahaha thanks for this  Good advice and humor is exactly what I need right now  SD is just "one" place where I am honest about myself and my actions   The undergirding principles that support my success first require a Pillar of Honesty     Honesty about what I'm thinking  what I'm doing  actions and behaviors  and my emotional state   Hearing from others who understand what I have experienced  and what I am experiencing is useful   Finally  when I contribute  when I share "me"  when I become exposed and vulnerable  I receive unearned and undeserved caring and compassion   I have made many friends herein   Even if we've not met face to face  I care for them  and they reciprocate   What about you   How is YOUR journey  Thanks  Means a lot    and I'm wondering if I should pursue a lope taper the next few days and quit the kratom altogether  Or should I stick to my kratom taper and stay away from the lope for a few days  I feel totally fine today  and i may just skip my last two kratom doses    Thoughts  For me I like reading the stories from 'day 1' people  It reminds me why I came here and why I quit in the first place  I want to focus more on the positive but at this point in my sobriety it's about just not drinking  And that's what helps me  I also like it when I find a relatable story from someone with more time than me  Shows me its possible   I spoke with a counselor   She recommended meetings   I went and got support from people who understand  got tools  resources and fellowship   I've not looked back  Good for you    Personally  I was on subs for quite a bit longer   been sub free since April21  2016  I stopped at  5 mg and had been weaning down for about six months  Imodium  Tonic water for restless body   that was the absolute worst part of the wds for me  if you can get s small script for benzos they will help the transition greatly    but I didn't want to get stuck on those either  Just stay away from antihistamine  Tylenol PMs  etc  to make sure they don't trigger any more restlessness  Take the kratom if you can  it'll help  Kava Stress Relief tea by Yogi  I believe  helped me a lot as well  Feel free to pm me  Started happening to me around then too   It never improved and if anything happens much easier these days  I'm 35    I am a classic binge drinker and never drank everyday etc   It is one of the main reasons I'm giving it a rest   That and the anxiety ridden hangovers which also get worse  Nice one    I spoke with a counselor   She recommended meetings   I went and got support from people who understand  got tools  resources and fellowship   I've not looked back  Wow    Great Job   Yeah I may just stick to tapering the lope the next few days and just abandon kratom altogether I feel pretty good today and don't think I need my two schedule doses today  What do you think  Really hits you when you dont consider yourself a smoker until you realise you've been lying to yourself for years  and im only 23  I have anxiety and obsessive tendancies so i think its one huge mixing pot  Im in real estate so the pressures quite high Guys  is not working with "ok just one"  I quiet I hope last time  exactly 1 month ago  and is the third time  First time I quiet for 7 months  I was with a friend and I ask him for one  I smoke it and in the next second I was already to store to buy a pack  Second time for 2 months same story    Now I hope I quiet forever  here are some issues about my health  maybe it will scary or help others     Blood caughing from throat  not from lung 100  sure   pain in throat    Feel tiered all the time    My face looking all the time tiered   my eyes looking like a junky addicted person    Wrinkles like a 50 years old person  very bad looking    I was feeling intoxicated sick    My blood circulation was damaged  sometimes I feel in some parts of my body the blood is has not a properly circulation    Serious memory problems because of bad blood circulation    Taste smell 0   Color of tongue and lips was kind of blue again because of bad blood circulation    I was falling asleep very hard sometimes and in the morning it took to long to wake up from bed     sometimes really insomnia   Now what I feel after I quiet lets say after 2 weeks     No more blood caughing  no more pain in throat   No more feel tiered  I feel that energy like when u are a child    My face look much better  the skin of my face is like your replace it  no more wrinkles  my eyes still look a little red because I know I am still intoxicated with all the crap from cigs but I look much better    Blood circulation improved  1 month after I quiet i wouldnt wait to fix all my 10 years of heavy smoke but anyway I can feel improvments    No more memory problems    Taste and smell almost 100  recovered    Color of lips and tongue are now pink  not blue and ugly    Now I can falling asleep in max 5 minutes  amazing how can easy fall asleep now  also in the morning I don't even need a clock to wake up  how I open my eyes I'm ready to wake up   Conclusion  Exactly the oposite of the side effects of smoking    What make me quite  Caughing the blood from my throat because it was irritated of have smoking in my last 2 3 months  For a few days I live with ideea I have lung throat cancer because of smoking  I wouldnt want to see a doctor  I was afraid to find out I have cancer  I was feeling like a trash  doing nothing all day and looking on walls   in that moment I found no problem to quiet smoking  I said ok if I go to doctor and he will told me that blood is from a little irritation in my throat I will go back to continue to smoke again   maybe less but still smoking  So I stop smoking and lets see if I will caugh blood in the next 1 2 3 months    after 2 weeks my blood caugh stopped and pain from throat gone   BTW I was smoking almost 2 packs a day  I'm 26 years old and I start to smoke from 12  By the age of 14 I was already kind of addicted  buy packs of cigs every day but in the last years I became very    very addicted     2 god damn packs a day  Even my friends tell me    "Dude u just smoke a cig and u fire up another one "  "Dude u don't look better  did u sleep "  And for what      for what to smoke  to have all these negative side effects  I'm done    I spoke with a counselor   She recommended meetings   I went and got support from people who understand  got tools  resources and fellowship   I've not looked back  No need to sound all defensive about it  Well  this is my only place for that  and it does a good job   What a Lovely Palindrome  Thank you very much   I plan on it   Great  Least its not just me  gonna be a hard 3 more weeks Congratulations on your Sober Solar Circumnavigation  I spoke with a counselor   She recommended meetings   I went and got support from people who understand  got tools  resources and fellowship   I've not looked back  Congrats on your Sober Solar Circumnavigation  Bench 200   gain back definition but stay around 170 lbs  look sexy for the wife  look sexy for me     How i'm going to make it happen     Other than not drinking i've been walking a 2 3 miles each night for over a month  taking some Isopure protein and eating much better  I weight lift every other night  I'm currently bench pressing around 165 but my wrist keeps preventing me from going up in weight so i'm staying at lower weights for now  Best of luck with your goals  you can do it   lol  glad to see I'm not the only one with the goal of  gaining  weight   Every post here about weight is about losing it   which is of course awesome if that's your goal     Alcohol has the opposite effect on me   I can literally drink 8 beers a day and not gain a pound   Instead alcohol leaches nutrients and calories out of me leaving me constantly on the skinny side   Here's to stuffing my face  drinking loads of sparking water and getting yuuuge   I've got 1 hour 45 before it's a new day  They've just started kicking off again upstairs  It's been hours since I had that drink  I don't want another  It's hilarious listening to them  I'd quite like to go sleep though   That's exactly it  You know  when I start thinking about the future  I tell myself it's impossible for me not to drink at my next bro meeting  at my next best friend birthday or my own  or the next holidays  and so on   I have to consistently force myself to get back in the here and now  Step by step   Thank you for your words     Congrats  That a big deal   I never woke up regretting not drinking   Thanks for the saying  exactly what I needed I haven't tried neck stretches   How long were you having these headaches for  I have them all day literally lol  You made one full day  You can do the second one as well   I spoke with a counselor   She recommended meetings   I went and got support from people who understand  got tools  resources and fellowship   I've not looked back  Still not drinking  Busy day with kids tomorrow so going to  try  get some sleep  I will be back on this sub tomorrow as I know today has been made slightly easier by the support on here and I need that in my life  Minute by minute is what I aim for too  Goodnight and thanks for your kind words    know people who casually smoke   That's how we all started   Thank you  that means a lot and I hope you are having a good day  The badge helps me stay accountable to myself  typing out responses helps me clarify my thoughts on sobriety related issues   hopefully helps others with the same concerns  and reading posts from newcomers reminds me what I was like when I had to quit  I'm glad to help    I have a meeting tonight and then just watching tv   Boring night but it will be nice to get back into the swing of things with aa   last week was a little crazy and off     I will be around all day tomorrow  I work from home  so make sure to post if you run into any issues or need an ear   I'll keep an eye out for your posts   And if you have problems going to sleep or need an ear  just post here   I'll see it   I am five hours behind you so I will be up during your 'middle of the night '  Awesome job today   This might sound bad  but reading the badge resets help me the most   Sometimes you think "maybe i don't have a problem  one couldn't hurt"   When i read those  they remind me that it is not worth the risk   That is fantastic    Great post  The only thing I'll disagree with is your notion that you should just stop in and say thanks  Everyone's story is important  I am not an "old timer" yet  but I still love to hear the stories of the struggle because it reminds me why I quit and why I keep going  The more time I have  the more I need to listen  Thanks for your post  Congrats  I'm still dirty  you ain't missing anything  Would love to just have a normal shit   I love AA but that was a surprise  And dude  it is doom and gloom sometimes  Nobody waltz' into an AA meeting on their wedding day  Don't live in a dream world  At the point you are even considering AA  some fairly ugly behavior has had to have happened  some introspective thoughts about ones self that maybe something is not quite right  I will be honest here  Sometimes I went to make sure there were people more fucked up than me   that whole comparison thing  I'm not proud of that at all but some days in the beginning I attended as much for them as I did myself  And once  some guy said to me after I shared  that he had come there to remember what it was like to be newly sober  So if my life's shit has helped anyone else get their life together  then please feed off my misery  I definitely noticed that I'm much more in focus when only using my imagination  When I mastrubated to porn I noticed even switching fantasies midway making my mind wonder all over   I definitely have a bit of a death grip  I'm trying to be more gentle  Just takes some time   If someone wants to do it without fantasizing then go ahead  but I don't think theres much benefit to that and it definitely will make the orgasm milder  atleast for me  Thanks for the reply  Nicely done    Experience  strength  and hope   No nothing I'm passionate about  just been super underemployed for so long  so it's about making a high amount of tips off the books   For some reason I don't think being at the bar around drunk people will be a trigger  I think the high stress of having to get a lot of drinks done fast however will be    But just about every job has some stress to it  So it will really be about me conquering stress and not finding it as an excuse   I actually went into a bar today        it was pretty tough but I managed   Which is odd  because I always drink and smoke   This week is still a week off for me so hopefully it won't be so bad during my breaks  No  but you're just as addicted as square one   You can measure progress however you want  but it helps to educate yourself about the science of it   Knowing how it works helps a lot   Get science on your side   We're here for you  brother  Starting Day 4 now and you wouldn't believe how the feeling of being so clearheaded again would resonate with intelligent people like yourself  Stay with it   wax can be such a monstrosity because it skyrockets your tolerance and doesn't deliver any of the side benefits of flower  imo  YOU GOT THIS  I no longer have that desire for the 'ahh cheers' at the end of a work day  I use to every day when I was drinking    Quitting drinking and fully accepting my life as it is now  has complete removed that desire  in addition because I am not drinking I have found that my mood has leveled out and I am not having peaks and valleys like I was when I was drinking and I therefor not looking for a release at the end of each day  For me relaxing in the evening is reading an article or two in the New Yorker  or reading a few chapters in a book  I read just under 50 books in 2016  and I found immersing myself in reading learning really did the trick  When I was drinking I would read 1 or 2 books a year at most  Your behavior with alcohol sounds like the alcoholic behavior to me  It sounds very familiar  I see a lot of red flags in your post   In a way  it doesn't matter if I think you're an alcoholic  It doesn't matter if any other commenter here thinks so  What matters is what you think   because you are the person who controls your behavior    I personally found it a relief to admit to myself that I shouldn't drink  because I can't rely on myself to control my drinking  It was a relief because I spent so long struggling with it  Quitting drink entirely was a much easier way to deal with life   I'm glad you are working on staying sober  Having one drink doesn't erase your time sober  or what you've learned from it  Please don't use this relapse as an excuse to start drinking regularly again  It doesn't sound like you plan to do so  but we alcoholics are really good at sabotaging ourselves   Are you working any program of recovery  I found a lot of help in learning to live sober at my local AA meetings  www AA org lists meetings near you   you'll be welcomed   Congratulations to you for getting out of a bad situation  You've had a lot to deal with  I'm wishing you all the best  Checking in  Such a lovely post thank you  I have often been in my car hungover or slightly wasted and imaging just smashing into a tree or a wall to end it  the fear of not dying and just ending up with some serious injury always put me off it  I hope that along with giving up alcohol these thoughts will go away  but I know I need help and that is what every single poster on here has given me today  In the UK  Checking in  Little late but I'm here  Normal   One of the beautiful things about recovery is that  if we have done our 3rd step properly  we no longer need to 'deserve' happiness   We are just given the chance to be happy  and since our 'will and life' are no longer our own  we can allow joy and abundance into our lives without feeling the need to 'deserve' or 'justify' those things   It just comes if we let it   Come to think about it  I  never  felt like I 'deserved' happiness  which is why I opted for intoxication in the first place   It wasn't until I worked my steps that I was ready to allow happiness to happen despite myself   As stated elsewhere in this thread  do your 5th step   You will gain some much needed perspective on yourself  and on what you have uncovered in the 4th  Dude sometimes this will happen to me and I'll blow a load in my sleep  Weirdest thing to wake up to It depends  It's hard to tell  but I'd say no  Weed likes to stick around   Don't be ashamed about it dude  you can't control your dreams For me  the anger  rage in my case  and depression  deep  empty soul feeling for me  is the worst part and why I relapsed in the past   Thanks Pris  Hope you realise how much you have helped me today  I will be sure to check in tomorrow  hopefully the emotions of today will help me to sleep  I feel drained  Have a lovely evening and thanks again     Goodnight  Since I never tapered  didn't have the self control   I'm honestly not sure   The only thing I felt strongly about when I quit was that I didn't want to get sucked into another "natural" addiction like lope   I was terrified of going down the same road   The most I took was valerian for sleep   Everything else scared the bejesus out of me   I'm sure it's fine in moderation  but then moderation has always been my weakest point   Do what what will get you free and clear of both substances fastest and with the most confidence and strength   Good luck  I got pulled over once for swerving when this happened  Fortunately the cop understood  but it will be nice to not worry about it  I think that's true for a lot of us here   I sort of lost touch with who I was while drinking 3 5  hours each day     One mistake that led me to relapse last year was expecting too much from sobriety too soon   I know I'm not going to reinvent myself overnight  so am giving myself a year to work on what I want to be when I grow up      Huh  that's nifty  I don't think I've had a fap since I went clean but I'm gonna try this and pay attention to the results    Though my girlfriend did blow me last night and it felt spectacular  but that's probably just because fapping of any kind   anything with your SO I get the big bag of generic cough drops  Get the menthol ones   Hurts like a bitch to sit on it so I've been running around all day cleaning and cooking   I'm pretty sure I'll live  If it doesn't work for you  it doesn't work for you  Nothing wrong with that   As far as powerless goes  I know I'm powerless over alcohol  This isn't some article of AA faith  I learned it from experience and it's what motivated me to seek out AA  I have proven to myself time and time again that once I take a drink I have no control over how much I drink after that   That's all powerlessness means to me  I don't really wish it were different or wish I were normal because if wishes were horses  you know    AA's not for everybody  If it's not for you that's cool  you just need to find what IS right for you because you are worth it   I tried a few ways  Cold turkey  One week of pure hell followed by a month of moderate hell followed by 11 years of it always being in the back of my mind till relapse   Chantix the first time  severe nausea when not taking strictly as directed  followed by 3 4 days of moderate hell and relapse 6 months later   Chantix the second time  severe nausea when not taken strictly as directed  constant queasiness  to the point of quitting quitting   Reading Allen Carr  Small handful of impulses decreasing in intensity  frequency and duration over 2 3 days followed by 449 days of complete confidence I'll never smoke again with zero temptation or desire   On the contrary  the idea is repulsive and you couldn't pay me   I wouldn't smoke one for a  1000  Got any Megadeth  great and exactly what i am going through   I guess I'm looking for validation in the hopes that I'm not wasting my time or missing out on limited releases  Oh I'm sure you are   There's probably some double bock  triple hopped  brewed in Etruscan rosewood barrels  aged since the dawn of the universe  bottled by virgins born of virgins being uncorked right now   But you're going to drink it not for any of that but because it has ethanol in it   That's really what you want  isn't it   All that fancy shmancy shit is just that   You're not the first person    by far    to come here who thought they just  loved  craft beer   But inside  slowly but steadily  that greedy little Golum figure came out of his cave and started hissing  I wants my precious  regardless of whether it was a warm can of Schlitz or a hundred dollar bottle of bourbon   Well   fuck him   You're 26   Even at double your age it's absurd to talk about "going down in style "  And what style is there in being drunk   Being a sucker that fell for the alcohol trap     You're doing the right thing by putting some space between yourself and booze   Pat yourself on the back and come here often   I will not drink with you today   I close my eyes  only for a moment then the moment's gone      r stopdrinkingfitness   Actually  I think you need to find some male nurse boy toy to look after it  I've written about my two realisations here https   www reddit com r stopdrinking comments 5lnw32 how i managed christmas and new years with no  My boss once passed by and made some crack about smelling smoke and I thought he was being such a snob  but now I get it  I reeked   I'm also glad I'm to the point of being disgusted by it now because I'd hate to detect it on others and be wishful at the smell  Last day of vacation so I've been drinking all day  re connected with a real old friend of mine and turns out that she is also a CA   smashed a few times so far   But I think I'm starting to become way to into Victor's lately  so that's probably not good  Its just a sign you're on the right path  My wife cheated and I got fired after we separated  After a few weeks of sulking I realized I'm losing all the toxic shit in my life  Except what I had control of  Now ive quit cigs  then alcohol  today is my first day not smoking  I plan on quitting porn and caffeine as well  I started meditating and doing yoga and I feel fucking great  I have  0 to my name no job and my place is 3 4 empty but I've never felt better  it always hurts before it gets better Thanks for the advice  I will not drink with you today  Your tale sounds frighteningly familiar   I'm starting to realize that just because I have    days under my belt  that it's way too easy and way too damaging to fall back into that old pattern   Thanks  Tapering sounds so nice    "I'll just dial it back and go skipping on my way "  Were it only so easy  I hear you  and I'll no doubt agree more in the 'down' times  Part of my intent is not doing it the easiest way   I simply want to be a person who can make a 30 day commitment and knows he can  At 25  the time to be forgiving on myself is rapidly slipping by  It's a harsh truth  but a truth nonetheless    Undoing 8 years of bad decision making  should  hurt  I consider the additional pain of white knuckling these 30 days to be part of the pain associated with facing reality head on    a skill I'd like to have more of as a 25 year old man that's already made his share of mistakes   I need to change now  and I'm exercising some faith in my ability to do it the hard way with this commitment  Succeeding is also a triumph of the will  something I haven't had in a long  long time   Congrats  Cheers to many more smoke free years  Have you tried just taking 1 a day   Would that maybe help equal out the solid to liquid ratio   Just relapsed right now  Take me off the list  Totally agree   When in doubt  just replace porn with heroine crack meth   My husband and I just had the same conversation like 3 mins ago    There's no civility in CA    We drink mouthwash and shit our pants  And if imma take my dick out  Imma use it   Yeah  it helps regulate not only your endogenous morphine aka endorphins  but also gives you a boost in dopamine  norepinephrine and serotonin  All of which are destroyed by chronic opioid abuse  Combine exercise with a diet full of nutrients  vitamins  minerals and protein and your brain and body will recover quickly  Although I haven't been exercising as often as I shoukd  I think that a good cardio session and weightlifting once or twice a day will help tremendously Thanks man  good luck to you too  I've had 8 years of experience not beating myself up about it  The coffee thing seems silly lol but I feel like the up and downs of withdrawal are made worse when caffeine is thrown in the mix  I'm allowing myself to have teas and whatnot  but I really want to stay as clean as possible  Checking in  Best of luck to everyone  "Have hope  not expectations"  adding that to my list of mantras  Thank you     Please do  I'm 26    Also you need to replace that smoking a cig thing with something else  for example I replace smoking a cig with making a tea    I'm drink tea in last month like hell  better than smoking  This hits too close to home for me  It seems any stupid thing I've done has been while under the influence  so if I remove the one constant then real change should occur  I'm going to a program this Friday called Celebrate Recovery  That depends on your definition of porn  some people consider any kind of nudity as porn  while other consider  only watching porn as porn  So that is different for everyone   I posted this on NoFap too  didn't get much reaction  Will repost later maybe  one step at a time  I will not drink today  I know you can do it   The way I look at it is this  If I can devote so much energy and time  to maintaining and hiding being a drunk I can devote that to staying away from it    Once you get into your groove  I promise you that you'll feel relief from the stress of maintaining that facade  You might not even realize how much stress it caused you  Even the little things like rotating liquor stores so they don't judge your consumption adds up on you    It's nothing to be ashamed about  either  So don't let it make you feel that way  Some people just hate carrots  or are allergic to penicillin  That's not weird  right  So why should being a drunk be weird    You are stronger than you might realize just yet   Same Yay for extra cat cuddling  I suggest having a plan for when cravings strike  there's lots of great suggestions around this site   Keep up the good work  Thanks man Thank you for reminding me why I never want to drink again   As a fellow pancreatitis survivor  I can relate   It's very hard to explain the pain of pancreatitis and the life alterations it  brings to someone who hasn't experienced  We can only hope that what we share here about it keeps others from having to go there themselves  May 2017 bring all good things    Yes  that is right  knowing the science behind always helps the cause  Ah  it's a deciding question    Ultimately it's up to you to answer honestly  You're a opinion is the one that carries weight    I know I'm an alcoholic  an addict who's drug of choice is alcohol    I could quit   but I couldn't stay quit    Once I had a drink I couldn't predict or prevent turning into a greedy monster    I listened a lot at meetings and couldn't help but identify    TL DR I hope grandma is ok   Me too  and it's a very effective one    This story makes me feel lucky  I had to visit the emergency room last night at 4am because my withdrawls go so bad I thought I was having a heart attack  I took an Uber ride to the ER because I didn't want to pay for an ambulance and I think it scared the shit out of the driver  Long story short they got my heart rate down  IV fluids  and some valium  One of the guy nurses took the time to sit down with me and really talk about the situation  He seemed genuinely concerned that I commit to getting through this and learn from it  I can only imagine the hell you went through with pancreatitis  I am going to use this blessing to turn things around right now  My badge resets and tonight and hopefully never again   Hi   Thanks for sharing  I would like to congratulate you because it seems as though you have done most of the hard work yourself  You have identified the problem  WEED  You have identified that weed is having a negative impact on your life and you have reached a point where you are no longer happy with the life your living  So again  congrats    You are not lost without pot in your life    you are lost BECAUSE it's in your life    Bro   I was in and still am  in your shoes  I know exactly how you feel to the fucking t and honestly it will get easier  It comes down to a few things    1  Stop watching porn and bussing nuts  Your semen aka your life juice aka the juice that makes life which is very special stuff needs to be kept inside your body  The retention of semen has two benefits  Firstly  it will increase your self control and secondly the semen contains stem cells which I honestly believe is crucial to the human body when breaking a habit  Keep that special sauce in your body and it will destroy brain fog  make you feel wayyy more energetic and after a no pot for a week you will have the most amazing wet dreams which is basically VR porn   the best kind   2  Join the gym  THIS has been the biggest tool for breaking my pot habit  My body is suddenly this construction site and I want to build the most beautiful building in the world  This only works if you have retained your semen for at least a week  You begin to feel like a beast  The massive doses of dopamine which was released upon me toking pot and watching porn is replaced by endorphines  Endorphines can only be released in large amounts when working out and sweating buckets  Its a much more consistant and stable happy chemical than dopamine  Dopamine HAD way too much impact on my mood and how I viewed life  When I got high  my body would release dopamine and for a second I would feel content with the world and my place in it  but once it wore off  dopamine would levels would crash which made me feel depressed  uncontent and so my brain would think about getting high again just to get another dopamine rush  When the endorphines leave the brain  you just kind of level out and go to neutral which is a great place to be  You need to remember that the need to smoke in just a bunch of chemical reactions  Once you understand these chemical reactions  anticipating and controlling urges is much easier    Once you complete these 2 consistently for two months  you will become a different person  Think I'm bullshitting about sperm retention  find the subredddit r nofap and read some of the stories  There is a link between POT AND PORN    THIS IS ABOUT YOU     ONLY YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR LIFE  STOP BEING A LITTLE PUSSY AND LETTING WEED CONTROL YOUR LIFE BRO  HONESTLY  ARE YOU A CRACK HEAD  NO  OK YOUR FRIENDS CAN SMOKE AND BE NORMAL BUT YOUR NOT THE SAME  SO DON'T TREAT YOUR BODY AND MIND LIKE IT IS    and no one is saying your gonna quit forever just stay strong for a month and if you still want to light up after that then go ahead but if your take my advice i promise that won't be the case    Keep it up  There will be some days that are harder than others but you can do this   Thank you  I just got to go through it  there's no way around it except to go through I did    And it's terrifying to think what could've happened  Genuinely terififyng  It's amazing the mental gymnastics one can preform to justify it   Just sold out   BLS and Sabbath are all that's left   Absolutely  I just came back from a workout  Rediscover the ON switch is exactly what I'm after   There's a disappointing point in quitting for 2 weeks when you realize all the problems in your life aren't going to resolve themselves because you stopped smoking  Chasing the ON switch and exercise will help fill that void  I hope   Maybe a crisis line  Maybe sit still  Know it won't last forever  Day 6 here so I totally understand  I'm here to support you the best I can  This Entire sub will support you   If he  wants  to quit  nothing is cheaper than free   which is what going to NA or AA costs   All meetings are supported by voluntary member contributions  which can range from zero to two bucks   Of course  12 step programs are notorious for not working for people who are reluctant or resistant to the principles of the program   The only way they work is if the person  wants  recovery   They do absolutely nothing in the way of enforcement or monitoring of the members  other than self reporting  so if your hubby is only doing this to save his marriage a rehab will be more effective  Thanks man  you as well  Congrats on your century  Glad you are sober  they can also look for raised whatever because alcohol and most other drugs so i bet your fucked  Also congrats on a year basically  Medical staff are generally very supportive of people trying to turn their lives around  Mine were overall pretty good  but it's difficult not to notice the "You did this to yourself" attitude sometimes  And   man   the lectures and patronizing  I actually gave up my primary care doc because she was such a bitch about it and had no faith that I could stop drinking without AA  or even with it  I'm glad that last night was a relative non event for you but enough of a wake up call to set you into action  Best of luck to you on your sober journey  thank you that's really helpful and makes sense  I'm really glad I posted on here all the comments have been very informative  I think I understand it more now  The thing is that I don't think my boyfriend would admit to any of that if it was true for him  or he would  but then he'd change his mind the next time we had an argument and he got angry and then the new 'truth' would come out  I don't know though   He read a book called "Kick the drink   easily" by Jason Vale when he quit and he said it totally changed his view on alcohol as an accepted poison and then he just stopped drinking  just like that and didn't seem to have any problems  He only slightly worried about going to places where everyone else would be drinking that people might think it strange he was was drinking soft drinks but only because he wanted to fit in not because he thought he'd be tempted  And he's not worried about that anymore  plus he usually asks for non alcoholic lager anyway and he says he enjoys looking like he's drinking like everyone else but secretly he's fine and doesn't have to suffer all the consequences like everyone else  I was worried at first that he'd drink again but I soon stopped worrying about that and it's been a year now and I know he's been sober the entire time as when he drinks he really drinks so I would know   What do you think about denial possibly being often connected to having a drinking problem and denial being like an emotional addiction in a way  which could carry on  with regard to that emotional stuff you said  even after someone stops drinking  Hang in there man  Sounds like you have a lot on your plate   Day 1 for me   I won't drink with you today   If you haven't already I suggest sitting down and REALLY thinking about what has tripped you up on past quit attempts and coming up with a plan to deal with those triggers before they happen   You can do this   Good luck   and congrats on the no drinking  that's also a great accomplishment   cool  I am thinking about applying to 2 schools in the UK and a couple others in S A  Is it ok if I PM you about it   he actually wrote we dont talk about post drinking shits     i  i  cant  i cant   Whenever I had problems with my neighbours' antisocial behaviour  I contacted the noise abatement team  the police and my landlord  I also kept a log of all the disturbances  Four months is a long time to put up with this shit  I kind of think about my pancreas as a fuse  Yeah  it broke temporarily  shut down my life  and had to be fixed as best as possible for me to move forward  but it's a hell of a lot better than the whole house burning down from an overloaded circuit  I feel fortunate that I didn't end up in even worse shape  Glad to hear someone can relate   Dude  Congratulations  I'm one day ahead of you  Hang in there  clean buddy  It's cold and rainy here  too  so my biggest complaint is that I can't get warm   but honestly  it's day 7 and I'm still getting chills and having hot flashes  I'm hoping the 10 day mark will feel better  The not sleeping solid or often is pretty tortourous too  but sleep is the last thing to come back  so I'm trying not to be a wuss about this part  Keep us updated  You can do this   It's so easy to fall back but if you view it as an addiction  which it is  it makes sense  But it's also possible to break the addiction and succeed  You can do it  Use anything you have to   food  straws  apps  hypnosis  to succeed    You can do it      In all honestly though I completely understand the sentiment behind your post  I've had to do a lot of court mandated rehabilitation bullshit and all I hear half the fucking time is "I've puked more than you've drank kid " It's not something to be ashamed of  it's a disease and you're taking steps to treat it  Your English is very good  by the way Approaching evening now here on the other side of the pond and over a mountain range     I feel the same way about this group  I haven't posted anything yet  just a lot of comments and reading  but collectively it has become the friend I chat with over morning coffee and the friend I lean on in the evenings when I'm feeling lonely  depressed  or when a craving for booze strikes  Whatever your path  I hope to see you around here  friend  And I hope you're having a great night  Good job   Keep up the great work   You are an inspiration Those are some great suggestions   I would add that using this site for support can be a HUGE help  reading and commenting on others going through the same struggles was really helpful for me  Congrats on your success so far  Keep it up  I can say that once I got sober the feeling that I needed outside influences to feel OK about my life was largely lifted  When I pay attention to my spiritual life  what works for me  I can usually experience serenity regardless of my circumstances  I know that if I drink today that will all be destroyed   sure  best wishes for those applications  Eventually  yes  There are good days and bad days  But gradually the times you are thinking about it begin to be outnumbered by the times you're not  Stays in your system for   38 days   That is when we would test our new clients  to see if they smoked while in our facility  They have weekend passes   Ninja edit  I don't make the rules  people  I just have to follow them  A  No employer I know checks liver enzymes   B  Elevated liver enzymes don't prove when someone was drinking    C  There are plenty of other medical reasons your liver enzymes might be elevated  so there's no way they can say it was 100  caused by alcohol    Fridays after work is one of my triggers  but I can genuinely say that I don't find drinking relaxing  I just persuade myself that I do over the course of Friday afternoon   I think distraction is going to be my best bet  The less time I spend thinking about not smoking  the less I want one   You're very welcome  I'm glad I could help  Alcoholism is tricky because it so heavily distorts our worldview that breaking out of the pattern can be very difficult  Going forward  a commitment to being honest will do you a load of good  Honesty with professionals about amount and frequency of use  honesty with your support network if you are struggling  and most importantly honesty with yourself about what you know to be true about yourself  Good luck  My butt generally hurts when I drink  The only way past it is through it  Your body is going through a lot getting past this addiction  so be kind to yourself  Congrats on day one of your non smoking life  Yes was nice   Yes   that did suck  I discovered porn around 7 years ago  where we would look at it at sleepovers  I eventually discovered that there was more stuff like it on the internet  I eventually would sometimes masturbate to it around 3 times daily over the course of those years  It made me feel awkward  especially around women  I am so thankful I discovered  r pornfree around late 2015  and I have never felt better  So what now  Get tools   Learn   You have to approach quitting drinking like anything else you want to undertake   Just blindly putting the bottle down may or may not work out     In the right side bar is a free e book called The Naked Mind   Please consider downloading it and start reading   It can help you change your perspective on alcohol   Keep coming back here as well  That's so awesome  Well done  Caribbean vacation to boot  And I thought the standard Christmas dinner was hard  Way to go  Congratulations to all the victorious 13    Congratulations and more power to everyone seriously trying to be pornfree  no matter what your badge says  SO MUCH THIS  I love Elliott  Listen to An Attempt To Tip The Scales by Bright Eyes  I'm sure if you know about Smith you know about Oberst  though   AA works for me  I needed a new way of looking at and living life  The big book and members of AA showed me how to deal with life without having to drink about it  I am forever grateful for accepting my powerlessness  It's pretty great not being the center of the universe    I looked into refuge recovery  Carr and Smart  AA is the best option for me   Thank you for saying this  We really do have to love and respect ourselves  and smoking helps accomplish neither of those  I'm glad I'm not alone    Weed really does destroy relationships friendships if you allow it to   I decided to take out all my rage and sadness on breaking my glass pieces with a hammer    Shards spread all over my kitchen but my kitchen really needed a good cleaning anyways   Congrats  Keep up the solid work and good attitude  thank you for your reply  That makes a lot of sense I think and is helpful  My boyfriend seemed to find it so easy to quit the last time he decided to  He read a book by Jason Vale and then he just stopped just like that and hasn't had one drink since  I don't think he'd admit he could still have any mental problems because of that  but i don't know maybe he would  I just can't really imagine or if he did I don't think it would stick in his mind somehow  He's never been against seeing a therapist but he also thinks he doesn't really have any issues so I'm not sure if he would want to  That's obviously his business though  Is there any material you would recommend me to read to understand this aspect of recovery  I'm not worried about him drinking anymore  I'm just thinking maybe he has other emotional issues still which could be connected somehow  I don't know I could help him though if it is    Do you mind if I ask  what do you think about denial possibly being often connected to having a drinking problem and denial being like an emotional addiction in a way  which could carry on  with regard to that mental stuff you said  even after someone stops drinking  "Winter's gonna end  I'm gonna clean these veins again  so close to dying that I finally can start living " It kills me  I'm currently detoxing in 5 degrees  Thanks for predicting my life  early 2000's Connor   Love this and it's so true  Thanks  Mouse and happy new year  I'm sorry you're in such a difficult situation  Before I admitted that I had an illness that needed to be treated AND I was ready to accept guidance  there was absolutely nothing that anyone could do for me  I had to want to get better  Personally  I have never seen anyone recover when they didn't really want to  In my opinion  the best you can do is to begin your own recovery   for you and your child  Maybe your SO will want to join you  but I wouldn't depend on it  Forgive yourself and look forward  Use the pain as fuel to try again   I will not drink with you   I highly recommend using this subreddit as often as you need it  I truly credit the support I found here with my success in quitting for good  EMDR   I haven't heard of this before  I'll be looking into it  Thanks guys    this is a helpful post x I'll tell you a secret that someone once told me  your friends probably aren't watching your drinking nearly as closely as you are   I used to run through scenarios in my head  what could I say when someone asks me why I am not drinking   The truth is  many of my friends didn't even notice    others were happy with a "No thanks  I'm not drinking "  I never noticed how many people don't drink at all until I became sober myself   Best wishes to you  friend    It took about the first month for the 'beer o'clock' thoughts to disappear  Leisure time is now spent doing a whole variety of things from spending time with family  and being present   cycling  trombone playing  reading   walking   Considering he lives in an igloo  that's doubtful    I just moved from KC and believe it or not  there are people who want the name of the team changed  Same with the Redskins  etc   No problem   Glad I can help   Have a good nights sleep   This  Just  Yes  This and Handcuffs  Just the whole fucking album   I'm sorry you're suffering  I know how much it sucks  The only sobriety I have is today  Nothing else counts  Your first questions kind of hurt the first time I read them    But he is absolutely right  I do need to work on myself  I think the hardest part of all of this is realizing how much this has affected my life    It's fucking sad and pathetic  But realizing how sad and pathetic I was only makes me realize how much I need to get better     1   Have some compassion for yourself    Forgiveness and kindness to oneself is crucial in these efforts to better your life     2   What can you control right now      How much you drank last night  Nope    How much you're beating yourself up  Yep    The things you said last night  Nope  done and done    How you approach and hopefully alleviate the pain you can see in your girlfriend's face  Yes    How much you drink right now and later this evening  Yes yes yes  that is in your control   I have over a dozen cans of Febreze in my car and house thinking it would hide the smell  And it didn't at all  I have a lot of laundry  cleaning  painting to do after 10  years smoking in my house and car  But it's worth it  2017 holds a magical Power at this point  Hope it works out for us all  OMG  PCRandy   your still with us   what's  happening  Please don't drink today   okay    How's that nice neighbour of yours doing   All AA meetings are independent   if one meeting is no good try another and another  until you find one that works for you   Edit  AA members should not be telling you to stop taking librium or whatever medication you are on  you need to taper  follow medical advice  Glad you're here commenting  You're doing yourself a huge favor  and I hope abstaining makes your 2017 that much better  Good luck    You might want to check out an AA  AAAA  or SMART meeting in your area  You don't have to be alone and even if it's not your thing people there usually understand that you're not in a good place and it's okay to feel shitty  Best of luck   I always thought boss was slang for cops  Where I'm from that's what people call cops when you're in Jail   This really hits home   I know all about NoFap my friend   I have been on the journey for a year now and im currently on a small streak  and i realize this is probably my biggest problem  maybe even bigger than the pot  I have also been going to the gym for the past year and im in great shape compared to when i started and i really have to agree it is the best thing that i have done for myself  Thanks for understanding  this helped a lot and kept me from driving to buy a sack  Mmm   not a bad idea actually  Great post  really hit home with the part about coming up with reasons to make an exception or push that first day back  For me it was always a craft beer I was saving or a nice bottle of whisky I had bought for the holidays  This year I ended up taking only 3 sips on New Years Eve and pouring the rest of the glass out at 11 50pm  That was an empowering feeling to kick off the new year   It's so good  I plan to read it again when I finish This Naked Mind   I read it a few years ago when I first started trying to cut back on drinking  and I think I would have a completely different perspective now   I thought about the book a lot when Scott Weiland died  because Duff writes about how he really tried to help him get sober when they were friends and in a band together   He's a very cool guy and I found his insights on his experience to be very mature and inspiring    I think I am going to do the same with my primary care doctor and find someone else  The way he acted when I opened up to him about drinking made me feel awful  I dread going in for anything     What do you think about denial possibly being often connected to having a drinking problem and denial being like an emotional addiction in a way  which could carry on  with regard to that emotional stuff you said  even after someone stops drinking   Yes  When we first get sober  and in my case for decades after  we are damaged people  Being sober is not the same as recovery  I have seen people stay sober for many years  and be miserable while sober   It is a ton easier if you have a support system that is also trying to stay sober  I find mine at AA meetings  because that is where you are assured that there are people actively trying to stay sober  and find a better life   I know that most of us have a really hard time with the "God" stuff and that it is a problem for people   Think of it as finding "Good Orderly Direction" in your life and it will help   I STILL recommend r alanon for YOU  That program is for people who Love Alcoholics  and I will guarantee you that they will have some real insight for you into dealing with your own feelings and questions  Thank you  I'll see you around  Enjoy the sunset    I am  in fact  the best  Welcome    In the first days  I checked SD frequently  heck  I continue to do that   I also tried to me more gentle with myself  and I gave myself credit for taking the big step of not drinking for today   I also ate a metric ton of ice cream  and I didn't give myself flack for it  I'm just now beginning to get my diet back on track    and that's okay  Better to eat a bit more than to drink those calories    In terms of ongoing work  I am taking my self improvement very seriously  and I've been reading texts that will help me confront the real issue  my own fear and self loathing  in my case  drinking was a symptom  not a cause  of something bigger and badder    Sending you good vibes for your journey  The good news  Yes  the cravings eventually go away  I am at a point where the thought of lighting a smoke seems as weird and wrong as it once felt to be leave the house without cigarettes  The only thoughts I have of smoking are a vague regret for the damage I did to myself while smoking and how gross smoking is  usually when I encounter someone else smoking    The less good news  It takes awhile for that to happen   Looking back on my post history from this sub    it took me a few months to really "become" a nonsmoker  But it happened    not all at once and not continuously but it DID happen because I stuck with it  It can happen for you too  just stick with it   Good luck  I have very little advice but an abundance of compassion to offer  Therapy sounds like it may be in order to address your communication issues  That may lead into deeper discussions about his alcoholism  but as "pretending" mentions   my experience is that making the decision is an individual's prerogative  In a loving relationship  I have never seen a person willfully impose a major life change on another  I've only seen change emerge from within a person and grow with the nurture of loved ones  Sprouting the seed of change  though  is solely the domain of the afflicted  Oh I'm sure I will before long  u likewetsocks   I spent 11 days in rehab   I kicked the booze and a nasty opiate pain med habit   I should have died from the the shit I was putting in my body   I was taking vicodin oxy's roxy's percs fent and washing them down with Jack Daniels   I spent 3 days in a hotel in Hamburg Germany drunk out of my mind and wishing I had the guts to jump from the 15th floor   I didn't eat the whole time and I was withering away to a weight that I hadn't been at since I was 14   I'm 55   I spent years alienating my wife and 2 daughters  23   18    I cheated and lied   I was useless for work and ended up losing my job   In March 2016 I woke at 6 am to let the dogs out   My family was still sleeping   I had 2 pints of bourbon hidden away and a script of Ambien   I decided to just have a nip  and you guessed it   I drank both pints and took 3 or 4 ambien   I woke up at 8 pm   My wife took me to the ER for medical attention and to clean out my system   Two days later I checked into a rehab center   I have been clean and sober since March 22  2016   I followed the advice of my rehab therapist and attended 90 AA meetings in 90 days and went through 4 weeks of intensive outpatient therapy   I wish you all the best going forward   My life is so much better now and my sobriety is one of the most important things in my life   I even got a meaningful song lyric tattooed on my forearm to remind me of the hell I lived for years   Please reach out to this board if you feel you are slipping   There are many supportive people here and we DO care    Keep up 100 pushups a day  bring my triceps exercises up to 100 a day  get up to maybe 150 pounds  5'9" but always very compact   Want to run more too but fuck doing that in the snow right now  maybe in a month or so  Thank you for your comment  I'm not a spiritual man  so I hope I can find something to give me the serenity you feel today  All the best to you and see you around  Oh yeah baby  I know that you're getting down voted because of the similarity in the Marilyn Monroe quote all of Reddit hates lol  but seriously thank you  I really needed to hear this  When we broke up he pulled the whole "let's talk again when you get to feeling better" and I agreed    But you know what  Fuck that  If he won't stick around through the hard times when I fucking need a friend and support  then why should I stick around and be a friend to him when I do feel better  Things between us have been AWFUL for the past week and a half  and I'm NOT excusing my behavior  but there's a reason things are awful  and he should have at least tried to understand  Idk    Venting and ranting here  Strong work right here  it all depends  If you dont do it a lot it could clear out fast  I would buy fake urine  you can get it at headshops and some gas stations  You're in the right place  This sub is an amazing place for support  insight and inspiration  This Naked Mind and this sub are the only reason I made it through the first few days  It gets better  I promise  We are here with you  one craving at a time  I will not drink with you today  I'll absolutely do all of that  Thank you for your kind words and all the best to you too  I find that focusing on the book helps a lot  The author recommends reading slowly  a chapter or two a day  so you digest it  As well  I focus on all that alcohol has cost me  For example all the wasted money and bad behavior   I find this group helps a lot as well  I wish you all the best  Great job  I hope that 2017 gives you a life beyond your wildest dreams   If you really feel that you are a danger to yourself  please  PLEASE call someone or go to a hospital  The last three funerals I attended were all suicides so I take this all very seriously   It took a near suicide for me to hit bottom  admit that I had a disease that was beyond my control and reach out for help  I had zero chance against this illness by myself  My bottom was the worst day in my life  and I wouldn't trade it for the world because it woke me up and led me into recovery  And today I truly wouldn't trade my best day drinking for my worst day sober  This is a good place to be  I will not drink with you today  Congratulations for both the 100 days and for having the courage to it took to share  My biggest fear is that I'll one day get complacent and think I can just have one and I think hearing stories like yours will help me avoid it  thank you  I just passed the day 4 mark  I'm using anything to pass the cravings  Food  cinnamon sticks  chanting  apps  We can do this  So worth it   Try the Smoke Free app  It is helping me  I think that your supposed worries about explaining the resignation may be a deflection  "Life circumstances forced me to prematurely end my previous employment  That situation has since passed  and I'm looking to make a difference here " Boom  done  Worry gone   It seems that you know the real issue is how to stick to sobriety  You're already making excuses   an imaginary "stressful job driving" you to drink  A job doesn't have a hand  It can't pick up a bottle  unscrew the top  and pour vodka in a tumbler  Both stress  specifically how you judge and react to external events  and the decision to drink are within the domain of your control  I would focus on developing personal responsibility and seeking the support of in person help  whether it be a doctor  a friend  or a group  I know some of this may sound harsh  but I want you to know that the power to stop drinking is WITHIN you  not some mystical force only permitted by your circumstance  I'd give it some time before having a fap if your counter is correct  Atleast 2 weeks and ideally a month to help sensitivity go back to normal  Hope we don't have to wait a year for the next installment     I was at 120 days  got into an argument  had a few  backed off then went full swing back into smoking for a month  One of my mantras for this time is "protect the quit " My balls feel like a pair of maracas     I quit my amazing job  dropped out of uni  burned almost every bridge in my life  made my pot dealer rich  fell out with family  ate myself to the brink of obesity  i had a relationship with Lisa Ann and for a long time i felt as though weed was helping me get though these problems   but weed indirectly caused them  Once I came to that conclusion  it became a lot easier to quit  Anytime i feel the need to burn up i just open my notes and read that list and it gives my the power to put my phone down and find another way to kill time  Also  random jogs  Wanna smoke  go for a jog  I found it helped me    You need to tell him how you are feeling  I think everything you have said is reasonable  and you shouldn't feel you are in any way afraid of expressing your thoughts to him  You are about to have a baby and it seems he isn't taking this very seriously  He can't be getting blind drunk constantly when the baby comes that's for sure  it's gonna be a shock to the system to him for sure  so I would say you speak to him about this now  Maybe he can start making changes now  before the baby comes so that it isn't such a shock  Having him drinking all the time around your baby when it arrives is not a fair environment for your child to be in  in my opinion  The baby deserves a sober father   Squats  jogging  walks  anything that works your legs help Same look on my wife's face this morning     I decided I'm not gonna do that to her and our amazing kids anymore   According to my NOMO clock I'm 14 hours and 50 mins in  Stay up brotha  You can do this   I will not drink with you today   I've decided to start going to a program called Celebrate Recovery at a nearby church  This     That makes sense   I seriously think I should do it twice day  I don't wanna take any GABA  Phenibut  or smoke any weed  I don't wanna take anything that I have to deal with later  I'm taking quite a variety of vitamins and eating well  Plus loads of water    But the exercise helped so significantly for a good 1 5 hours  Now I'm back to aching again  so maybe I need some more  I'll literally do anything to kick this and feel better   Checking in  I think it's safe to say that there's no limit to the love this group has to give  Glad you're here  And I hope you will learn to love yourself  slip ups and all  I have reset my badge countless times and messed up so many times  and one thing I learned through it all was that I needed to learn how to love myself  even if only a bit at a time  to make positive changes in my life   Replacement  This is why a lot of people start chewing gum when they stop smoking  You need a new thing to do  Look for a new hobby  One that doesn't require you to go outdoors and be around people  I'm not saying stop drinking and start shooting up  But a healthy alternative to keep your mind off of the things you don't want to do  I quit smoking 420 and started reading  Maybe that might work  maybe it won't  keep trying new things until you find something you like   You can do this  We have faith in you  But you have to have faith in yourself  keep fighting   Thanks for the post  it's just what I needed to read right now  I'm on day 2 and I've been sitting here contemplating just having a couple of puffs  Not going to now    it is hard but just keep trying  everyday is a new day   I'm pushing a year feb  after 9 years on 16mg of suboxone a day    I jumped off at 2mg after tapering down to my first week at 2mg I jumped  It was a long and miserable process  I'm talking 50 60 days  Before my energy came back to were walking up 2 flights of stairs didn't feel like I was carrying my body weight in lead  Lead suit they call it here  It took 50 days for the diarrhea to stop  The hot and cold flashes went on even longer  got did seem to get less frequent after the 40ish day mark  By less frequent I mean like 25x a day rather than 55x a day made up    you can't actually count them   I got ahold of a months worth of Xanax so I could sleep  I couldn't take hardly any time off of work  A few long weekends but that was it   Now  subs were a long marathon type w d that I managed to work through the entire process  I mean  I would literally run home at lunch break and take a hot bath and go back to work   Hot baths help with the cold chills immensely   I tried Kratom and Imodium but never took the quantity required so I don't know if it helped    One thing I have to stress is while it was not easy  I managed to work and not miss much time through it all  Things get easier after the first 30 days  I was never able to work through the more violent type withdraw of H or Oxy or whatever  But I did work through the subs   I jumped at 2mg because I feared I would fail trying to taper lower  I didn't know what I was in for at the time  Had I known  tapering lower would have been more of a concern to me    Now  Going off subs was the absolute best thing I ever did for myself  I feel better  Sex is good again  Music is good  Friends are good  My hobbies feel like my hobbies again  I had no clue how much subs changed my personality  None  I thought I was Normal on them  Trust me  I was not    The end result is very much worth the short term misery     I know how you feel  including the combining drinking with pot  I had a similar episode a year ago where I wanted to quit and everything just seemed useless and worthless when sober  I was not used to the world sober when I was not at work  What personally helped me that period was trying to get my chemical imbalance together by not just quitting drinking and smoking  but also eating healthy and working out  I was pretty strict with this  and also started reading up a lot about nutrition and physical fitness  Also  reading books about alcohol addiction like Allen Carr and This Naked Mind helped me out  After getting through the very depressing first period  I started to get feelings and emotions back I haven't felt since I was a child  The world started to get more beautiful again everyday  and I myself started to get more beautiful everyday  physically and mentally  And after four or five months I started feeling cocky and was convinced that I now was healthy and strong enough to enjoy an occasional drink socially once in a while  And then I thought I deserved the occasional drink by myself as well  and what the hell  let's smoke a joint with it  it's just an occasional thing anyway and I was enjoying it way more now that I was so healthy  It didn't take long before I was back where I started  Now I'm on day 2 again and not drinking with you tonight  Hope you find the energy to get through this phase  you can do it  it's worth it  I'm so glad that you took the first steps and came here to share with us   Many things  Checking in  Writing posts I can go back and read to see my progress  Getting and giving support where I know people relate and are not judging me  Reading Day One stories to remember where I've been  Gleaning wisdom from posts and comments  Seeing inspiring stories  Reading about relapses to remind me what happens  Learning from others' stumbles and successes  Reading things I relate to and not feeling alone    I suppose basically learning  sharing and supporting   The thing is YOU ARE fighting against your own brain  I had to figure out my other more common issues  like with general anxiety and OCD with medication  before it was a lot easier to not pick as often or as damagingly  It's the obsessive thoughts that makes the shirt feel like it's itchy  Sometimes it's self sabotaging that makes you pick even when you weren't going to anyway  You are fighting your brain just like addicts are fighting the crave   I understand what you're feeling  I have been there before and I have also had to face the horrible shock to the ego that comes when partners and friends tell me straight  up "miranda you're a fucking pothead"  I've lost many relationships as a result  But honestly this is the best time to turn this around and you will  You have fallen down temporarily but don't just get up  get on your hands and hit 10 push ups for the haters  like my uncle says lol  Kick it's ass dude  I just owned up to my wife that I relapsed  It felt good just getting that off my chest  I told her I quit cold turkey but I am tapering down  Two kids and a wife that I really want to be there for  Enough of my poor decisions I'm glad I am at a happy place in my life with things to look forward to  otherwise I don't know how  some people would be successful quitting   If willpower worked  we'd all be cured      This is so true   The human mind is an amazing  powerful  creative thing   It can find despair in the most blessed of lives  it can find happiness in the most dismal of circumstances   The difference is  what are we looking for   If we are looking for beauty  pieces of joy  bits of happiness  we will find them   If we are looking for clouds of sadness  misery to mire ourselves in  we will find that too   We cannot change the things we have no control over  but we have exceptional agency in our response  mentally and emotionally   Good on you for learning that now  it has the power to change your recovery drastically   You got this  good luck  Congratulation to you and the people who care about you       Thanks for sharing  This brought tears to my eyes not only for me but for my husband  I feel like he's on a path towards something like this  I sure hope not  it sounds awful  I'm sorry you had to go through it but if it helped you get on the right path  there is some good that came of it  I will most definitely not drink with you today   That's why we need you   to remind us     Sign me up  Clean so far Celebrate recovery is good  but give AA a try  The more angles you look at the better your chances   Please see  r Alanon  a support group for friends and family of alcoholics  Meetings are almost everywhere  they helped me  I learned I cannot control or change someone else  but I could get help for myself  I'm sorry  but you can't fix him   8" and ten beers a day  I feel average   Just remember  it'll pass   You have controll  not the smokes   Day 7 for me   This sounds like alcohol withdrawal  Your doctor is the best person to evaluate your detox needs   Why do people in the south call a pen a pin  It has to be approximately accurate  I've gotten a few 50 gram bags of caps   5 per cap 100 caps  recently and used those when I wasn't staying on top of making caps  It didn't feel any different    Good luck to u too   Take a water bottle with a straw built in with you  Take drags of water whenever you feel you'd naturally take a drag off a cigarette  Muscle memory is a big part of driving and you've trained yourself to have that hand mouth thing incorporated   To be honest with you  it took it becoming legal for me to want to quit  I have a dispensary on every corner now  It is everywhere here in Denver  That being said  I haven't been tempted to go back in one since I made up my mind to quit  It is too easy to get anything now  The worst part is that there is so much competition  prices are dropping fast  That makes it even worse in my opinion  I can get twice as much poison for the same amount of money    Those guys ain't getting a penny from me anymore  Stay strong  Thanks  I got the link from the Smoke Free app  Will be using this a lot in the coming days and weeks  It does a great service  but it's too religion oriented to many  I only count 2 total  1 of which is wrong  50  isnt great  but with that small a sample size hard to find a noteworthy trend  particularly in this age of autocorrect   Maybe ur just a bit too pickled for parsing atm  50mg for the day is child's play   I've had 600 800 a day in detox  only for the first two days though    Edit   how much Librium do you have   Don't torture yourself with a taper if you have enough for 3 4 days   Just up your dose a little    Benzos plus booze in small amounts will not kill you  despite what the fearmongers say    However  it will totally throw off your taper  You can't cut back accurately if you have 2 variables like that   Actually recently unpacked some of boxes of books from my childhood room and there were a couple bibles in there    I stored them next to my Dawkins    And today I truly wouldn't trade my best day drinking for my worst day sober   Thanks for this Also hot baths with Epsom salts  blankets and lots of tv help  And it the past while peak detoxing  I would turn my bathroom into a sauna and sweat it out for awhile  then lay on the hot bath  then rinse with cold water to shock your system a bit  Seemed to help too See  r Alanon  a support group for friends and family of alcoholics    See an attorney about getting her into a hospital   Signed up for the January challenge so I'll sign up here and see how far I make it     Here's a sneak peek of  r Alanon  using the top posts of all time        1   Even as a therapist  it's tough to have boundaries with addicts  https   www reddit com r AlAnon comments 4yxgkb even as a therapist its tough to have boundaries         2   Thought this might feel familiar to some of us  http   24 media tumblr com tumblr md4wvamVQX1rbz8tgo1 400 jpg        3   So it happened  My mom died 6 days ago from Prescription Pill abuse   https   www reddit com r AlAnon comments 5a7l3f so it happened my mom died 6 days ago from     I'm   a   bot    beep   boop Thanks for the thoughts       I'm hoping to avoid meetings altogether because I don't want my husband ever to know how far it got   But then again what if my reluctance to confess it means I'm not really 100  ready to put it all the way behind me yet    I'm going to get a few days perspective on it and then decide what to do next    This mornings post about pancreatitis scared the crap out of me though    Did your health issues mostly resolve themselves    When we got my sister clean 78 years ago she was so ill her skin was yellow and she managed to make a complete recovery as far as anyone can tell     Hearing this stuff is kinda scary  From my perspective  anything under 8 grams or so seems like such a small daily dose  People are talking about reducing by  1 g day    I guess I will need a scale after all   It was simultaneously one of the worst and best periods of my life  Obviously  the suffering was intense  but the sober months that followed have been a godsend  Chris Pratt jokes that he lost all his weight from quitting beer for a month  That's literally what happened to me  I can't believe how much I can eat  within my macro nutrient guidelines  and still shed the pounds  I feel like a million bucks looking in the mirror these days   I didn't elaborate much on my decision to make the video for my wife  The guilt I felt that I might leave her alone  widowed and parentless  before she was 30   all because I overindulged  over self medicated  It'd have been my fault  and      well  That's enough said  I hope your husband gets on the right track before any wake up calls are needed   for your sake and his too  And congrats on your 26 days  Almost a month  Luckily I withhold that joy for the next morning   It really makes the drinking experience a life experience   I'm really glad you lucked out and found somebody cool to help you out  How much were u taking when u started your taper and how fast have you gone   Awesome        That's really great and you are an inspiration for all of us     However many upvotes this thread gets is how big my dick is    We're at ten now    guys better start downvoting    I'm pretty sure at one point  I had a copy of Hitchens' God Is Not Great hidden behind religious bullshit   Sparkling water   Ahhhh  Great advice  this sub is awesome    I am only on day 2  it's hard and I've been fighting the urge to smoke one  Coming to this sub reminds me of why I am doing this  Sometimes is just takes reading one or two things to help fight that urge   Absolutely yes  What kind of training do you do  We play chess to keep warm here  too  Way to go  The tough days are coming  but you sound like you have the right mindset  Keep strong  You are on the right path   Yes it really is worth it    can't put it into words   you have to give it at least 2 months    it's a gradual thing    the hardest for me was the first 2 weeks    your body and mind go into repair mode     I personally went to a therapist    others might need in patient or out patient care  This is your life  You can do it    don't feel like your alone   others have been to where you have been and came back    wish you the best    it is not meaningless    trust me   I get left out of everything    Strong work right here   Tim is family   Word  it's not always comfortable to feel  so aware and alert but it probably makes your life better in the long run     High Five for four years           How did you do it  Being free feels so fucking good    Xoxo Now that I don't drink  I'm not exhausted and in need of relaxation by the end of the workweek   D It seems that being in the habit of drinking is the only thing that made me feel like I needed a drink after work  I also bike 14 miles round trip to work  so that mellows me out at the end of the day  haha    If I want to kick back and relax I just have a non boozy beverage and snuggle my dog or my boo  Seltzer water is your friend  Or tea  or hot cocoa     I can share  These smaller steps help more than you think  Kudos to you Let me ask you this   when I'm AA  did you go to regular meetings  Did you have a sponsor  Did you work the steps  Did you pray    I personally do not believe in prayer helping correct anything  and I'm not even sure there is a god or if he cares  I do know that pausing and saying a prayer helps to get me out of the problem and into a place I can act and not react    Do you do service work  Do you speak to other alcoholics on a daily basis   Remember at the end of the meeting we say it works IF you work it    Good luck   Exercise helps tremendously  Without it  I wouldn't have been able to quit Tim is FUCKING family   If you're going to spew  spew into this      I love that saying  Maybe it will help me in my exercise endeavors   You can do it  18 days and 22 days are worthy accomplishments   I have similar struggles  My wife drinks a couple of times a week  but she's not drinking like I was  We used to enjoy having a drink together  Or  well  it started out that way  By now she has accepted that I'm not drinking but it was something of an adjustment there  Shoot  yesterday I drove her and one of her girlfriends to the bar for happy hour  and then went and picked them up again in a couple of hours  I mean  I just don't super care about the bar  So I skipped it   On Christmas Eve we were invited to a small gathering with some friends  and they all drink  I am starting to come to terms with the fact that it is a little uncomfortable  And there is a little awkwardness  But they are good friends  and they shrug when I say I am not drinking  but they are still good friends  I just wish we could always be "doing" something  instead of standing around eating and drinking  Thank you sop much  I am trying to focus on how excited I am about freedom and all the new healthy things I can do with all the extra time         impatiently waiting       For the first several weeks of my recovery  every Friday after work I would tell myself  'it's happy hour and I'm not happy ' I coped by working out  going to AA meetings and to movies  One evening I noticed that I had no desire to crawl away from my imperfect life and into a bottle  I realized how much more room there was here on the outside  What about the Shitty Beatles   r LucidDreaming might beg to differ  Absolutely my favorite line from that movie   The dude just looks at him with the face of complete confusion    Checking in   Hang in there  You can do it  Something probably jumped up from the toilet seat and grabbed your meat  Exacthefuckly   Someone on some post on this sub said something about boredom that really resonated with me  It isn't like if you drink or smoke you are really doing anything exciting  you get fucked up make all these grand plans and then just end up on the couch or sitting on a bar stool  So try to pull the wool off your eyes and realize the substances really aren't making your life exciting   they are just making you think everything is exciting   That being said the boredom kills me too sometimes  I'm lucky that I'm in a pretty demanding field so it keeps me busy most days  As someone else said   find a new hobby  something to keep your mind busy   You won't like it at first   but no one likes eating kale at first either   force yourself to do it and eventually you will like it   The Monkeys   That sucks dude  my relationship fell apart recently and it wasn't as direct a correlation between drinking and drugging and the end but I have few doubts we'd still be together if I'd been present  I hope we can both do a better job of being there the next time  Beautiful  Thank you so much for taking the time to share your story with us    This is great   Where I clung to my expectations about what life was supposed to be  about what I deserved  that's where I suffered  How limiting  if I were the one to decide my experience  It's a big  beautiful  terrifying world out there  and I can't wait to see what tomorrow brings   Congratulations  Hope you keep growing and learning this year   Technically  Yeah  it can be several weeks if someone is a frequent heavy smoker  It's also dependent on other factors like weight and activity level since THC is fat soluble    But at least anecdotally from people I know  if you rarely smoke  it's cleared out a lot faster than that  My ex passed drug tests in less than a week sometimes    and I would consider him a habitual user  even    OP is definitely cutting it way too close though and I would be doubtful   Like I said  you need to replace that smoking a cig thing with something else  something good    making a tea  walk outside breathing some fresh air  yoga maybe  The brain is fixed and he know to take the "relax" thing nicotine to be more exactly  is to smoke a cig but replace this with other activities so you don't need to stay and craving  When I started coming around some 4 years ago  that was the beginning of the end  Damnit  me  "Life circumstances" sounds a lot better than "personal issues "  Thanks for this   I enjoyed reading your post and congratulate you on your one year    Awesome    I am going to try some of the meditation you mentioned    thanks  I took a break from drinking for 3 months in 2016  it went really really well  I felt great  I'm now committing to 6 months without alcohol as I've been getting pretty drunk at parties lately   I guess what I connect with about your post is the question of "is my drinking problematic " I feel like  for me  if I'm even asking that question on a regular basis  then something is amiss    I also want to share that I was surprised at how easy it was for me to be social and have fun at parties without alcohol  I was prepared to feel awkward and have to soldier through  but I genuinely had a good time hanging out while sober  Good luck to you  Well  rock on  grateful is a great way to be    Really  if I was in a relationship that didn't work for staying sober  well I would have to re evaluate that relationship anyway  This smells like opportunity to me   Congrats on day 1  Cagonewild will be there when you've finished   Im constantly waiting for the day i don't need to smoke before bed  Need to soldier through however many days of sleepless nights to get there but i just cant   The thing about life is  nobody can really answer a question that begins with "should" except maybe you  if you had enough information  which it sounds like you don't   There are a few things that are objectively negative about your life   no job and no savings  It is natural feel stressed out about this   It seems like you are also suffering some depression on top of that  Depression can be looked at as a physical condition with mental components  When you are in a depressed state  your brain is less available to you  It is difficult to enjoy things  you have warped perceptions about life  you fail to take an interest in things  and are less interesting to be around    Smoking weed is an option for breaking out of that state  It's not the only option  but it is a fast and reliable option and a relatively safe one    If you do end up smoking though  don't just give in to it  Keep trying to moderate  Keep trying to find a way to take an interest in life and this fascinating world we live in  Keep up with your new healthy habits  You CAN find your way back to a relatively normal brain state  Proud of you       your making a great decision      Stay strong   So well written   thank you for sharing all that unadulterated truth  And congrats on a year  That's the spirit  Good luck friend  we're here for you  Try and not shame yourself about this because it's the shame that drives us to this point in the first place  You're doing magnificent keep going  Shitty Beatles  Are they any good  Man good job Treble three   Congratulations  I have some great people who do not drink  who would like me to be 100  sober  I'd like to make these people happy  in theory  Now  today  I do not really care at all  Almost like I want to buy a shitload of booze and drink in front of them to make them be disappointed in me  maybe even throw me out of their lives  I think I'll go get some booze tomorrow    I decided whenever I need to use money for something  like hobby supplies  I use 10x that money on booze  If there's an unexpected money sink  there goes my economy  But it doesn't f in matter anymore  With you man  We got this  Day one You go ahead and celebrate here a lot       Awesome job     I smoking 2 packs a day too  Im only 26 years old  I quiet exactly 1 month ago  reason  spit blood from throat  In that day I caugh blood from throat I could't find any reason why to continue smoking  I don't want to die because of throat lung cancer  My throat blood caughing stop btw after 2 weeks of quiet smoking  Totally get it   You were good at it   Onward and upward  Because you should always do the right thing regardless of what others do What's to say everyone else is pretending to be happy    48 here  Also a binger  It just gets worse and worse  Hence my quitting  this time for the last time   This is a very light amount comparatively  well done for keeping it so low   Just goes to show that even small amounts taken over time end up being a negative dependance   The problem with kratom isn't the stopping  its staying stopped  that point two weeks down the line where you feel you've earned yourself a small reward  just one  Within a week you are right back where you started   Lots of help and advice here  You are an inspiration to me and many others    Congrats     Whats the context of this  Im so outta the loop lately I want to start running again  probably just on the treadmill at first but it'd be nice to switch to an actual track  Also trying to lose the rest of the weight I gained by drinking   I used to be the same exact way in college  but it took me quite a few years later to realize that this was a problem  I think it is very wise of you to recognize the issue now  instead of several years down the line  Your university should have counseling available  so I would recommend checking that out  Best of luck  my friend   People are always free to go other places to buy things   But here you can not link

proud that alcohol was not involved  Nice  I will check it out    A friend asked if he wanted to come see me tomorrow  I declined   I couldn't behave myself  I would just rage and be annoying  I think

They should name their team "those yellow tops"   You will get there I swear   Keep going how your are and the benefits will pour in I promise  be willing to give it everything in your hardest hour  and you will sail through it when its easier  I generally have no idea what's going on  I didn't notice anything and then there's suddenly a billion threads about this same topic  It reminds me of a couple of months ago when everyone was either sober or in the hospital  The regulars of this sub just don't drink that much anymore  Either that or they drink the same amount just not everyday 365 24 7  It's still a good group   I'm right there with you day 4 here   Best of luck to both of you one day at a time that's all we got   I love that you said you didn't plan on remaining sober  I think that simple statement can offer a lot of people some really valuable hope and insight  I didn't know if id stay sober  I just knew that at worst life was like a nightmare  and as best it was slipping by in stagnant monotony  Once I quit things started falling into place  and now I know that I just can't go back  Coming up on four years soon   loving my life  CONGRATS  You are a lucky duck   Nicely done  I hope so  I spoke with a therapist counselor today who put things in perspective  after 25  years of hard drinking  abstinence is hard but I've taken the first steps towards recovery   One big problem  my father is a serious trigger  Living with them for the next few weeks will be interesting  Prayer and meditation  Prayer and meditation  That was a worthwhile laugh  Thank you     But incest is free fun for the whole family   Meh  It's rude       Only joking  It's awesome  Simmer down Donald  we know it's "yuge" in the 'gina   Nobody is concerned about your hands unless one has my next drink    I awkwardly told someone IRL about CA cagw yesterday        I have no idea why I thought that was a good idea   I haven't coughed blood at all  Still  let's not go back  Your standards     seriously  I started with a commitment to a dry January  and just kept going  I can report that I found all of these benefits  If you look at my posts from March or April  it was all about continuing sobriety to keep the benefits coming  Thanks for sharing these   Honesty was a really important part of my recovery  to be   honest  haha   I realized that keeping my issues a secret from those closest to me was a way of giving myself a loophole to be able to drink again  YMMV  My health problems are 99  gone  thankfully  I have some lingering stomach issues that might honestly just be aging  can't handle spicy foods like I used to  too much coffee is a no no   But at one point my liver enzymes were like  through the roof  It's an amazing organ though in that it will regenerate if you give it half a chance  Keep us posted    MCAGA     Make CA Great Again      Shit  now I feel like I have to shower   Yeah  I realize not the best plan around  But trying to save some Librium in my "up shit creek" case with melatonin and valerian  I figured I wouldn't die like the Dr  was trying to tell me      he literally said "if you take this dose       and drink ANYTHING you can expect to stop breathing and will be back in here " I'm aware I've gotta be a little uncomfortable here when I did 5 7 days of a fifth a day plus a tall boy after my break  I just really don't care for a seizure      That sucks    Hope you can get back on track    Does "inconclusive" count as failing  I was on probation a few years ago and couldn't stop smoking so I would just chug water like no other before I went in    Only got tested once and it came back inconclusive  I told the officer that I was feeling really sick and dehydrated that morning and they let me retake the test the next month      Feel kinda scummy writing that out  kind of a pathetic way to "pass" a drug test    But yeah   Great stuff   Your so right about your mind  it can feel at times like YOU need to do those things  but just a moment of calm and mindfulness quickly shows its not YOU  its your mind  you already sound really resolute which is awesome so early in  keep it up man   Excessively  And six days is nothing   Great suggestion  You are not alone  I used to think drinking alone was awesome  then over time it made me sad  Then I reserved drinking only for a confidence boost to go out with people  I was really just drinking all the time   I am starting over  I will not drink with you today  Good luck mate  You're absolutely right about the fact that your life is never gonna improve while you're still taking this crap  You'll stay trapped until you grind it out and succeed in quitting   Nice work  could get difficult cooking with booze and having it around though  especially in early days    The tartar steppe  https   en wikipedia org wiki The Tartar Steppe  by Dino Buzzati    The long walk  https   en wikipedia org wiki The Long Walk  by Stephen King   Both are pretty fast reads  check these out let me know what you think   EDIT  Also   American Gods  https   en wikipedia org wiki American Gods  by Neil Gaiman  This one is being adapted for TV this year  Great  solid fantasy  Look it up   EDIT 2  Obviously the wikipedia links feature spoilers to the plot  I'd suggest skipping these sections  How long and what exactly were your symptoms of withdrawal   It would've been 40 days today but of course the dentist had to prescribe me oxycodone and I stupidly took one last week and I know for a fact that reset EVERYTHING  and today I was feeling down and took half a 5mg and I know I reset EVERYTHING again  I could've been where you are right now and it's sad and makes me hate myself even more  Oh all right   What the hell right  I have tried that so many times and always fail  If I have it  I'll smoke it  If I could scrape it out of the grinder  carpet or cat    I'll smoke it   I have survived today though  A few tears  a lot of anxiety  But I'm doing it  D Awesome  Congratulations      Weed gives me more anxiety but it fades in a few days Come on Sox  he's fucked anyway   let's tell him to bender into the test    Meth helps too  jumps the metabolism  And the booze is a solvent for THC   Here  take some motivation from me  You can just have it  you don't need to borrow it   Hang in there   I was pretty depressed for a while after I came out of the fog  Fuck it  what's done is done  Yeah  I've got a lot to fix  and I could have done a lot of other things I think if I hadn't been drinking  But I do what I can do today  Things have slowly started to look up  They looked very bleak for a while   Congrats on the smokes  Quitting those  14 years ago for me now  when my son was born  was a roller coaster  too  Through that and quitting drinking I have come to learn that sometimes the emotional roller coaster comes and all I can do is ride it out   Nice work  You are doing the right things  It will pay off   Love this LOL   I started to read your first numbered point and said "Oh shit  I forgot to get to the gym today"   Slammed the lid on my laptop and was out the door in 5   Thanks for that reminder   I really appreciated all you had to say   Still in early days  but it gives me so good things to think about in the future  Thank you for sharing this personal walk through hell with me us   In my personal experience  there are some great meetings in O fucking hio  if you choose that route   I am glad you are here and sober today    Be good to you today  you deserve it   I have a vape    there is just something soothing about rolling a joint and smoking it  That being said  therein lies my problem   It really is outrageous  I only smoked joints    that definitely didn't help  It's only 10 joints in a 12 14 hour period  P  That's rough  but you'll get through it   Maybe you can take notes or record instructions on your phone  so you can review later and make sure everything "sinks in"   Also  though it seems counter intuitive  I would suggest limiting your caffeine intake  since the effects are often magnified during nicotine withdrawal even a small amount of coffee soda etc can mess with your sleep schedule   On the plus side  since you've not been a smoker at the new job you won't have any triggers or associations to break  so that may make quitting easier  Congrats on the new job and good luck  There are many things I regret  since  I got sober  If I could drink myself into the past and correct them  I would gladly do so  right here  right now  But I can't  So today I choose not to pick up a drink and make the present worse  To the best of my ability I commit to staying awake and focused for another four hours so I can serve as an example to my kids that past mistakes do not need to be repeated  I think we both may have something to do with it       I also get lots of anxiety after drinking  to the point that my heart races for hours on end and I have wound up in fetal position just crying for it to stop   The good news is since quitting drinking  I haven't had anxiety at all  And I'm sleeping better  It's been pretty amazing  More amazing than drinking for sure  Being present  I definitely wish I was more present  She would catch me when she saw me drinking too much in a sitting  and I would ignore it and keep drinking every time   Is your badge current  If so congrats on your 103 days   We can only learn from it and do better next time I have yet to contribute to that specific sub   But you're all very pretty  I have a sober buddy who has been dry for 5 years  It's always great to get together with him   Congrats on 23 days  How is it going so far   Psh  don't worry  I'm not close with my family   Listen to your gut    it's right that you should be concerned  Even though you're in college and heavy drinking seems normal  drinking as heavily as you describe is not safe  not normal  and not healthy   The older you get and the more habitual this becomes  the harder it will be to break the addiction  I really wish I hadn't spent most of my 20s in various states of being drunk  I could have grown a LOT during those years    Quitting now will give you ample time to become the best version of yourself  You're in school    think about how much more you can get out of your education if you're not spending so much time drunk or hungover  It might not seem like it now  but being able to immerse yourself completely in study is a HUGE privilege and luxury to be grateful for   Your body will thank you  too  If you need an outlet for stress  hit the gym  or go for a run or bike ride  Being in great shape takes work  but it feels WAY better than being drunk hungover    I hope you consider giving alcohol the boot  It's not an easy choice  but as many of us here have found  it's the only choice that works  Let us know if you have any more questions  That is very true and I have also cut down on the caffeine   I just drink green tea in the morning  Hopefully tonight I get a good night sleep because I'm exhausted  https   www reddit com r stopdrinking comments 5lkpwu daily checkin for monday january 2nd good or bad  We are definitely very similar  Throwing out all the stuff yesterday wasn't bad  Today I just    want to smoke so fucking bad  I keep crying    but I think that is because I haven't really had to have any emotions for years   I will definitely be throwing myself into my hobbies more   bought new strings for the guitar today    camera batteries are charged and all my gym clothes are ready to go any time   I don't think it will be easy  and really do appreciate the reminder  because god damn do I want it to be easy  No  you won't die lmfaoooo  That's ridiculous of him to say lol    Good idea  Maybe plan to have some distractions handy  play a game on your phone  call a friend  cook some food  etc  for when a craving strikes  I wouldn't recommend it tbh  the most difficult times can be when your stressed  you will most probably have an association to weed whenever you feel unhappy angry  and when your still doing it  and something causes these emotions to flare up  you'll think fuck it  have a blowout and be where you were with all your effort wasted  Purely opinion obvs whatever you do good luck   You can do this  Thanks bro  I really appreciate the encouragement   I still drink heavily   But I've never posted much to being with   There will be newcomers that bring good content here   I'm okay with that    Lem  you're a gem   The biggest   YUGE   Just stating the policy from a government run facility   YMMV I actually snort laughed and he looked so pissed  Congratulations on a job well done  You give me hope and inspiration   Been vaping for around a year and just dropped it yesterday  I weened down a little but honestly I think the best way is to just cut it off  get over the first couple days  and be done with it Mannnn  smoking and quitting during the day didn't happen   I woke up  smoked right til I left for work  I live 5 min away  and would come home to smoke at lunch  8 11am I was fine  11am noon I was a miserable unproductive fuck  1pm 3 30pm I was great and then the last hour and a half I'd find any reason to just work my ass off to get through it   I'd ether smoke the second I got home at the end of the day  or bring a pre roll if I was going out for after work work shit  This post expresses my thought beautifully  Counter should be designed this way    And ice cream   I went to the gym a lot to keep everything pretty much net neutral    I had no designs on a sober year  just a sober January  I got here one day at a time   https   imgur com a KXCu5  LMFAO WHY DID I SAY THAT    Oh yes  alcohol  Alcohol is why I said that    Although considering I once drunkenly dragged that person into a bowling alley washroom and uhhhh introduced him to some things  I don't think he's particularly shocked   Yup  he is fucked  Thank you so much for the reply   The evenings were always wine and watch TV for us  I moved back home where my mom doesn't drink so there isn't alcohol in the house  which helps  but you are right  The evenings are boring for me   A problem is that alcohol seemed like it made boring things less mundane for me and I enjoyed it  I should have spent the time appreciating my girlfriend  but instead I tried to make something that was already good  better  which caused me to ruin it   My days always start at the gym and then I work and come home  Coming home is going to be hard  I'm going to be redditing a lot more until I figure out how to get passed the evenings   Thank you for the advice  looking forward to this extra money that i would have spent on drinking   I'm setting a solid 30 day goal for now The what if's are a bitch for sure  The feeling will pass though  There's absolutely no way we can go back in time to fix things  That's just life  I owe it to myself and my family to be the most honest  authentic and loving sober me possible  Early sobriety is very tough and an emotional roller coaster  My mentor had me write a list of 3 things I'm grateful for every day  Gratitude helps  Best wishes  and I will not drink with you today   Why does this make me worry  Chin up   https   www youtube com watch v q 7DgeRZpjI Let me know how it goes  going to look into some in a bit  just reading to try and help myself feel more sleepy    Ive had sleeping tablets  anti depressants  before but ive found if im still awake 2 hours after taking  shit gets really weird and makes sleeping even worse    Hope you have some good progress too  I'm a screener for CAGoneWild  you can always run them by me first to be sure you're putting your best foot forward    Jus' trying to help  of course    I do love a happy ending     Congrats on 1  year of living a better life  You're right  I unfortunately never considered getting sober until i lost my relationship though  I will learn from this   Thank you  Well done    Internet high five   https   www flickr com photos 24039053 N00 7734909872   Great job  once I got past Day 10 inclusive of two client dinners as well as a friend get together I knew I was well on my way to sobriety as a normality   Good luck on your continued journey  Wow  lots of stuff coming at you right now  I found that after about 35 days  my depression began to lift and hasn't reared its' ugly head since  I still get down in the dumps sometime  but I think "normal" people get that  too  I highly suspect that my drinking was exacerbating my depression  What's important is that you're here  Be kind to yourself and move forward  So  ramble on  my friend  sending love  hugs and support   I quiet 1 month ago  I start caughing blood from throat    That was a god damn good reason for me to stop smoking  for a few days I live with ideea I have throat cancer  I felt pathetic  miserable  Is not working like u say with a "hit" or 54ng   4 cigs    not working     U just have to quit and thats it   The best tip is    replace your "nicotine hit thing" wihch make you feel relaxed and better because thats why we all use to smoke  with another activity which make you feel relaxed and good    idk make a tea  yoga  breathing some fresh air outside for 10 mins  I tried ecigs too    I go back to normal cigs after 1 month  Also if u really quiet dont you ever try to smoke one to remember how it was    or try just a puff  I did that and I go back to smoke again       Now I quiet 1 month ago and i hope is forever  Welcome  Alcohol is probably my fourth or fifth favorite but it became my de facto drug of choice because it was easy and 'acceptable ' AA and this sub work for me just fine  I originally got sober at a club 20 miles from where I live because I was terrified that someone would see me  Now my home group is right around the corner because I have come to believe that nobody really gives a crap what I do in my free time   Lots of people are saying that   The best people   All set  You are going to have a great day  Checking in  let's do this Wow  you are so strong  This is a really  really impressive feat  You are an inspiration  I'm a practicing attorney merely in my 2nd year  I was also drinking about a liter of Vodka a day and first took a medical leave of absence in Sept 2016 then resigned from my firm for good in Nov 2016   In applying for new positions  DidntDrinkAgain has a perfect suggestion  I tend to state that I had to resign due to an "unforeseen medical issue" which is now "resolved" or alternatively  I state "unforeseen life circumstances"   Irrespective  the company interviewing typically has no legal right to dig deeper into those comments  Your personal life is your personal life    In getting better  everyone's life is different  I threw pride aside and moved home into my old bedroom and exhausted my savings to pay off as many bills I could  I'm broke  I live with my parents  and currently unemployed  but  I'm sober    Good luck and know you always have this site for advice  real life examples  or support    Sometimes we turn into assholes around the holidays  Shakes  prepare for the best  plan for the worst    Sorry bud  this sounds like a not happy outcome   I'm not saying the policy or rules are wrong  just that it's pretty long    Kinda like how ETG testing is "80 hour" but multiple studies have shown that people come up negative after a day or 2 if they're not drinking at CA levels   Well  I made it into a pot holder  I need bigger needles   Lol  I've gotten that reaction plenty of times   I'm not drinking today with you all lovely people  I did work on a vision bored for 2017  Okay  TMI confession time  I'm gay and I don't mind having the asspiss because I've gotten so used to my usual post wake up diarrhea that I always know when I'm clean down there for bottoming  Thanks for the answer  how long does nicotine withdrawal last   Good luck Hunt     thinks maybe Lem will try to get sober someday  thanks for this post  it's time to stop for me  i appreciate these resources  I need recovery badly but I haven't hit bottom and it's terrible  Help   What would be bottom for you  I kept finding lower ones for way to many years myself  You can stop digging any day you want as it turns out    There are lots of people here who switched alcohol for other drugs  you are very welcome here  You can also check out lots of other recovery subs too  there is a bunch of links in the sidebar  Take good care of yourself    I expected that to be Morrissey The Smiths   Holy shit what a faggot l m a o There was me thinking you were a nice young lady    Joke   We're the same breed  fuck it and try not to die  Going to bed early so I don't get bored and smoke  Too mentally exhausted to do anything productive to distract myself  I'm here with you Checking in and still kicking  This   You might pass   Drink lots of water and maybe try and sweat it out too if you can   But start applying for other jobs while you're at it  It's not going to be easy for a long time  unfortunately  But eventually  probably a couple weeks down the road  assuming you abstain  you'll have a day where you forget about it entirely  That will be the day you know you've made progress     very very close to my genitals and several hairs at once will cause me a lot of pain  I am going to run my first Tough Mudder and my second full marathon  Looking forward to working hard every day this year  Yes    Or thrombocytopenia   Checking in  It sure does  Our minds can talk us into a lot of things  Good and bad    I've had dinner and am all hunkered in for the night  As long as I get to this place I'm good  I'll join you in not drinking  Awesome that you are on your way  You have the right mindset  Stay strong  Congrats on this awesome move forward  I experienced really similar feelings  Although  I was confused at first as to why I wanted so much sugar  I never ate any sweets or sugary foods  It was always a joke that I had birthday steak with a candle in it  But when I quit drinking all I wanted was ice cream and candy    So I ate it  Alot  For months  But it slowly backed of naturally  Now I like chocolate more than I ever did while drinking  but still rarely crave sugar  My point is that while everyone is different  craving sugar is normal    I think it was important for me to not worry about too much at once    For what its worth  again taking into consideration that everyone is different  I lost over thirty pounds the first year  When people mentioned it or asked what I was doing I told them  Eating ice cream every day  Had they asked what I wasn't doing    I'd have said drinking  Words are funny  Good luck  be easy on yourself  A whole year without P seems overwhelming    almost impossible  But after 3 4 years of fighting I'm ready to give it my all  Taking one day at a time  ignoring the lies my brain tells me I CANNOT relapse  There is so much I want to do in life and P is holding me back  I want to be fitter  I want to be more creative and one day I want to be a father   P is negatively affecting all these things and more    I have to put an end to it in 2017  I'm so sorry for your loss and that you're going through this   I went off the rails with my drinking 4 years ago when my brother was killed in a senseless crime   I am so happy to be finally getting it under control  but I worry about how much I have damaged my body and I certainly can see how it has impacted my looks   If you can get it under control now in under 2 years  you will be so much better off  especially as young as you are   Also your kids are young enough that they will probably never realize that you were a heavy drinker   I've never heard anyone say on this board that they regret quitting  I hope you're able to give it a break for a month or whatever seems manageable to you  you can do this    They say the physical withdrawal lasts for 3 days and then it's purely psychological after that  So that means you need good coping methods and a good understanding of the addiction   if you can do this  it will be a breeze to say goodbye  Exercise  healthy eating  and meditation or mindfulness in general will help set you free   I'm succeeding at those things  I guess   Much as it hurts to report   Moz is a wanker   Still won't stop me loving his music though  You have told me     Hell yeah  Now that's a victory story  I want to go snowboarding pretty bad  It's a 2 hour drive though and I have no gear and don't want to rent      Congrats     That is an awesome quote  It really struck home when I read that  Congrats on starting your journey   i used r leaves for marijuana addiction but nothing came close to going to face to face NA meetings for me  it was intimidating at first just like the gym was at one point but as things went on i got the hang of it   i don't know where i would be without group   everyone is worried about preserving their anonymity it is something everyone takes very seriously but i totally understand your apprehension  what is said in group stays there  everyone is there for the same reason  to get better   at the end of the day if you can't get to a face to face meeting i would suggest an online meeting  they have them every day they are the acme of anonymity and a safe place to share and get better   you will find more details here  http   www na recovery org   good luck i think you are on the right path to recovery Shut the fuck up   Timbf is great and he's family here   holidays  I prefer to call them Mondays     though Sundays    The first 3 weeks was brutal anxiety  depression and crippling fatigue  The fatigue is what bothered me the most  Been thru a lot of shit in my life and can deal with the mental aspects but when you can barely keep your eyes open for damn near a month it's tough    Not to discredit what you're saying but I wouldn't think that the oxy should set you back that much  Give it a few days and I bet you'll be feeling better  Oxy is powerful shit  I've taken it many times in the past and it always would mess with my mind for a few days afterwards  Good luck mate    wish you luck Just want to say my heart is going out to u and I'm thinking of u  I lost a parent to suicide and it nearly killed me  I know no one shld be guilted into tolerating their depression but I just want to share from the other side  I also lost my damn mind thru drinking and pills and everything changed so much after getting sober  So much is possible  You're not always "clean" after diarrhea    It leaves more behind than proper solid shit   Hey KOTM  Congratulations on a year     I'm working on the meditation thing  and I've recently come across some sleep meditation stuff on youtube  it's working so beautifully for me  I hope to get to wear you are  it sounds exciting and peaceful at the same time     Thanks for having me in this sandbox  Thank you so much  same to you    From one non drinking non dualist to another  that was a beautiful fucking read  You used to drink tons  I really hope you stay dry  On the other hand  you are young  and already making wonderful discoveries  Perhaps wisdom is the greatness that was in store for you  High five  hug  thanks so much  we can do this   Mouthwash is cheaper but you can get vanilla with food stamps        I didn't think I could do it either   I'd pretty much accepted that I would just slowly drink myself to death   I'd tried before and failed   When I realized I couldn't do it on my own  I got help   I got a therapist   I read on SD for at least an hour a day  I also went to a few AA meetings and learned that alcoholics aren't two headed monsters  but rather decent normal human beings like you and me  I tried an anti depressant that wasn't the right one for me   probably because I was still drinking at the time and the two can sometimes cancel each other out   A new one I'm on is working much better now that I'm not drinking    Now  somehow after a few false starts  I'm at peace that I can no longer drink alcohol     Soooo    if a bum like me can do it   I suspect that anyone can         I'll be keeping a good thought for you Atahelsel    Has the same effect for me of pushing my emotional baggage into the future  also over time really ratchets up my anxiety  Short term sometimes I'll smoke to get through a bad couple of days  in an ideal world I would probably never smoke  It is  it keeps things green for me  Reminds me of what it was like  I am yeah  I'm getting some help with cigarettes from my work  but that's about it  It's not going to be easy  but all of the things that I'm ridding myself of all feed into each other like one big  nasty circle  They all gotta go    I'm not saying I won't ever have a beer again  but for coming future  my whole body and spirit needs a detox badly   I know this isn't really related  but how are you able to travel the way you do  I am trying  Thank you for the support  We got this   Ok  I'm taking your challenger  I am going to do this the next two days and you too  Then let's check back   Having recently been dumped myself  I know how you feel  I used weed to be numb and realized every time I smoked I would forget about my ex and how much she hurt me  At first that felt great but I realized that instead of helping me through my issues  weed only pushed my issues back  When I was sober I wouldn't feel any better than I did the day before  My advice to you would be to use this time to instead of sulk  make yourself into the person that  you  want to be  not the person that  he  wants you to be  After being dumped I started exercising  studying more  quit smoking  and eventually cut the toxic person that is my ex out of my life  I started to be happy with who I am as a person despite losing such a huge part of my life  If you can love yourself and be happy with who you are  then you know for sure that no matter what happens between you and your ex  you will be OK  Hope everything goes well  and good luck  Hey just to be FAIR    I really should get a turn     What      Come on   And you    Just keep walking mister    Keep walking   Faster lem  faster       Badge reset  I'm excited to not drink with you today   I have secondary hemochromatosis  It's not contagious  but basically is iron overload  Hate the term  sounds like something out a videogame  but the treatment is phlebotomy    Fuck that  Even my doctors agree that zero treatment is better  Since stopping all that shit   I've never felt better    Saved  Love the quotation  When I was dealing with anger a couple of years back  a thought that popped into my head one day was  Anger is not constructive  it's destructive  I will not drink with you today  Here  Not drinking with you all today  I'll join you  Sober on  Congratulations on deciding to quit smoking  That said  it is worth considering that nicotine withdrawal may certainly be a significant factor regarding why you are having a particularly hard time today  I don't like saying I know hoe anyone feels  because we're all different but I know what regret feels like for me  It's a hopeless place because there is truly nothing one can do to change things  but  and its a big but  today is yours  Quitting smoking is an act of self care and preservation    Which means you have hope for a better tomorrow  Hold on to that  and I can almost promise it will come  Shine on friend  Could you come back tomorrow morning and tell us what waking up without a hangover feels like  Yes the crippling depression is what messed with me the most  And insomnia  What was your dose   The weird thing I was only taking 1 gram MAX  no redosing just 1 GRAM a day  and the 2 weeks after were MISERABLE  Anything would set me into a crying fit or just really deep depressing thoughts  I was sort of feeling like that today and stupidly took half of a 5mg  so I'm praying I don't get slammed deep into the dark lonely abyss that was withdrawal  I'm glad you are feeling better  please don't start taking kratom again  I was thinking of yesterday after browsing the kratom subreddit  they just seem so happy and normal there it makes kratom not look as evil as it is but when you look at the quitting kratom subreddit it's a whole other world  Stay safe and happy new year sober     I am praying to continue this year sober that is my unsaid New Years resolution  This   Realizing that drinking makes me miss out on so much was the turning point for me  Hammocks are the solution for this predicament  Nice job I used to cook professionally and still do occasionally   Something like this would scare me for sure  Great job pulling through it    Yeah  that's pretty annoying  Happens to me semi frequently  actually  Not last night though  Not to be too discouraging but in the industry where I live those courses are a joke  Most places here prefer someone works their way up from barback and has any kind of real experience over a certificate  If you're a lady it can be easier to start at the coat check or as a server   Friday night is junk foods night for me  I watch a good  or not so good  movie or TV show and eat so much junk that I feel almost sick  It may not be the healthiest example but that's what I need  I prefer that over drinking  I feel like I have to stop talking to my closest friends about my struggles with my alcoholic husband   I know they are right when they give me advice and I'm too scared to take it   But I told them something that might help you   I told them that I hear them   I listen to them   I hear them   Their words and support are making a difference   and I am getting stronger  in great part because of THEM  to make the final changes to fix my life and the lives of my children   I guess this might not make sense  and I don't want to give you advice since my life is such a mess   but I am hearing my friends   and I'm working on it   If cutting your people out of your life is what you are ready to do  then I admire you   I also know how hard it is   If you want to PM me just to talk  I'm here  PM me  Not like i know or anything but try 1 gal jug of distilled water and a pack of plain gelatin 12 hrs before test  Should give you a diluted result and a retest  Dont fuck it up lol  Wow      Congratulations on all of your success      Sat in the parking lot of the restaurant  And read the entries of the evening in this sub          There were a handful of times in my early days of stopping  Sort of "coming to" in parking lot of liquor store where I had driven on autopilot  Got one foot out the door about to come in  internally screaming no feeling powerless  but found it in me to read a couple posts  Maybe respond with the deal that I'd still buy the poison if I had the will  Time spent in SD diffused the urge       This sub can be a powerful Kryptonite   That will be an awesome day     I look forward to being at that point   Right now I'm still at "oh god I'd totally murder someone for a joint" but I managed to watch a movie and eat dinner    and enjoy it    without weed  I think that's the biggest thing  Remembering I can enjoy things without being high  And that people like me regardless of whether I am high or not  and probably more so if I'm not   I'll be joining you friend   I went from April until October   Reset my badge   Started up again in November   Stopped visiting SD on a regular basis   Not even to lurk   Asking for a badge reset tomorrow when I'm on my laptop   NYE I went out for Chinese food with my wife and kids   I didn't drink   Got home and my wife opened the champagne   had a glass   Made myself a Mai tai   drank it and said I was done   I had planned on stopping again and Im real excited about it   I'm tired of feeling tired   When I'm not drinking I sleep like I did when I was a kid   dreams are more vivid   My mind  works so much better   I also bought a copy of The Naked Mind and I'm half way through it   I think there's a link somewhere on SD to read it for free     Good luck   I will not be drinking with you today   I'm in  I will not drink today  Is your friend attending meetings  I'd guess he wouldn't mind you tagging along or accompanying you to one if so  Never hurts to ask  Does she live you more now that you got drunk to the point of being sick  I guess not  That's because we can't control others  Some people think I'm an asshole and nothing in the world would make then change their mind   Hot showers are the shit   https   www reddit com r stopdrinking comments 3w0q33 feel i turned a corner   Possibility  fibroids    Do you have heavier periods or irregular ones    I won't drink with you    OK   What I am not getting from your post are the reasons why they would believe you are  or on the verge of  isolating   You also say that they have only known you for a year  and they don't know you "very well "  I don't know you at all  but I can state with all confidence that one does not have to be drinking to be an "isolating alcoholic "  One of the sure signs of an impending slip is isolating from the support   Of course  I don't want to over dramatize  nor do I want you to   but early in sobriety I heard a helpful saying  if 6 people say you have a tail  you may want to turn around and take a look  I agree that there is a difference between stopping and actively quitting  I stopped back in 2012 to game some liver test numbers  but this has been my first shot at actively quitting  Only wish I hadn't waited so long to try  Best wishes to run in 2017  Welcome   You can feel at home here at SD   I stopped drinking because I finally woke up one morning and was SO SCARED that my boyfriend would leave me  after dozens and dozens of times of being blackout drunk  talking crazy  breaking vases for no reason  etc   The anxiety of the future of continuing to drink haunted me   So I took it upon myself and stopped   Just like you decided to do today   Congrats for making the best decision of your life  Sorry about your girlfriend though    Your future is bright  Guess what   Today is a new day    I'm not drinking today  you're more than welcome to join me    We've all been there    Hi MWR  holidays have been great  Kids made out like bandits and we got a chimneysweep to fix our fireplace then I installed new hearth grate  Ditched an ugly  dated brass one  So we're having some cozy evenings  Hope yours is alright  alright  alright too   I vote that you be covered in leeches     a few times a year Is it like 3 5 or 10 15 times a year   This Naked Mind did wonders for me  best of luck to you   Stay close to this reddit  you'll find endless support  Great job  This is how I approached it when I stopped drinking two months ago  so it's nice to hear that it worked for someone who has been sober longer than I have   I'm one of the few people I know who actually gained some weight when I stopped drinking because I replaced a lot of beer wine with snacks   I still am weening myself off of a constant need to consume  but I figure in the beginning anything is better than alcohol  I worked supervising in a hospital kitchen once   They had half gallon jugs of pure vanilla   I got really drunk while working one night on it   Then my boss showed up and I panicked and ran away   Left my purse behind so I didn't have my car keys   Called my bf from the parking lot and cried until he came and got me and I broke the heel on my favorite boots   Good times baby  At my height I was taking 25 plus grams a day or more and tapered down to 5 grams  quit for 5 days  went back up to 8 grams and now I'm down to 6 grams  Went from 8 to 6 in about 2 weeks  This is a great way to do SOMETHING to keep from caving to the pressure to smoke  The badge  I love watching it grow   The thought that maybe sharing my experience can help others   Reading the Day 1 posts so that I never forget what it used to be like  I used to be at Day 1  More than once    The constant  24 hour access to people who totally get what I'm struggling with       Recognizing people and seeing them progress and cheering them on  It's awesome  Aw momma  I'm sorry you are thinking about what could have been 'if only'    I get it  I know what it's like to wish like you could have done it differently  A lot would be different  But  it's today  not yesterday  Today you are paving the way for tomorrow and all that is yet to be  You can't change the past  no matter how much you dwell on it  But you know what  That past brought you your beautiful children and created the kind heart we all can see you have  This feeling will pass  It will   Thanks for bein here for me man  awesome post Wow  it's a sign that you are doing the right thing   Good on you   I will not drink with you today  I just figure that it's because my blood is so thin from all the booze   I'm a bleeder I noticed that was true for me when I was around 19  but officially decided it is a problem when I was 24   It doesn't take a lot to get me drunk as it is  but it seemed like fewer and fewer drinks were necessary for me to black out   So some nights I would only have 4 drinks  at drink 3 I felt fine tipsy not that drunk  but then I remember ordering a 4th drink and nothing after   I'm so grateful that I've been safe   that I usually woke up alone in my bed  somehow     I kept thinking I could just cut down my drinks   If 5 beers makes me black out  I'll only have 4   Okay well now 4 makes me black out  so it'll be 3   But by drink 3  I'm already emotionally committed to drink 4   So I guess my limit is 2   Giving myself a limit makes me cranky and then I'm at the bar feeling weird and unfun because I have a strict limit     so now I just don't drink     I think it's totally fine for people to drink in moderation  but since I have learned that 1  I'm highly prone to blacking out and 2  I don't do moderation very well  it seems like abstaining is the only choice   A girl I used to know worked in the kitchen at the state hospital    State Hospital   long term psych facility  Yes  she was a patient  after you've been there long enough  you can work there    it's actually a legit cushy state job    She broke open one of the foaming hand sanitizer things and drank it all    Promptly fired  and they took the hand sanitizer away from the whole facility       Edit  I should add that she had been a  patient for like 2 years  got released  and then immediately sent back because she saw someone on TV swallow razor blades and so SHE SWALLOWED A HANDFUL  how the fucking fuck    Amen brother  I've been "here" for about four years  Seriously  if you get fucked up everyday you qualify here  There ain't much more to it   struggles to type  Everyone that finishes gets a job  from corporate places to dive bars  to bowling alleys  A lot of barbacks are in the school because they can't get an opportunity to be taught where they work  Also with this school you can go back and use the job services anytime   Congratulations Nippy  This is why I have a calendar that I cross off each day I don't look at it  With the calendar  I can see my overall success  and with my badge  I can see my current success  Chuck out the scales    Get a sledgehammer and smash them to bits    It's the kindest thing you can do for yourself  You've already taken the tough action to stop dieting  This is the next step to lose the diet mentality    Also give your body a chance to balance itself    How many years did you purge for  Give your body a chance to adjust to regular food and nutrition    Done it all before haha  its the sitting here trying to sleep yet feeling so tired thats driving me nuts  Also haven't loads of people died from lack of sleep  Don't forget  the sub you're in is self alcoholicsanonymous so we're a bit biased   Others have mentioned the sub stopdrinking which might provide a wider perspective but AA is what got me sober  Wow  You have an incredible story  I'm sorry for your losses  I'm so glad you found sobriety again  I raise my soda stream bottle to you Fruits like strawberries and apples are full of sugar and don't have corn syrup or other fillers  I'm an ice cream and dark chili late person  myself  My energy came back over a few weeks as I started clearing my body of the alcohol and residual health effects  My sweet tooth is still here and there  but cravings waned after about two weeks   Thanks for the reminder  It is easy to convince myself that I can manage casual smoking  43 days smoke free  Good for you   Thanks  it's current  I'm not happy with my life but drinking isn't the solution  You can get to here and way past it  I know it  AA groups pay rent and buy coffee supplies literature and chips  The only time I've felt pressured about money was when I was asked not to donate so much when the basket was passed "Not to embarrass you but we're not a poor group  a dollar  if you have it is great"  I've also never been to a meeting that worried about its size   Maybe this post is awesome Great job man  glad to hear you were able to overcome your temptation   I can't help but find it funny that you tried looking for porn on Facebook  Is that even a real thing  Checking in for January  I never did that    But in desperation and extreme WDs I drank rubbing alcohol once   You know you're in trouble when you're googling how much rubbing alcohol will make you go blind  Thank you  That is what I keep reaching for in the dark  That I can learn from my mistakes and make it better   Fantastic insight  great job on 1 Year   NyQuil or zzzquil helps me get through the first week  I prefer the NyQuil because it helps with being uncomfortable  achy  and just blah   My 16yo son got in a minor car accident at thanksgiving and I was sober  I was able to drive to him  he was less than 10 min away  and wait for the police  I'm so happy I could be there for him    A few years ago  my oldest son almost had to walk home because I was too busy drinking  Another mom drove him home so he didn't have to walk across the highway in the dark  I'm so happy I'm not in that place  I'm so happy that mom drove him home    Happy for you too  Glad you are ok too  I need help   The good news is  that I've learned to ask for it  so I have been  and I'm getting it   I'm pretty fucking far from ok   My SO and I  had a long talk today  and he finally expressed that why we have no future at this current time is because I drank for so long in the past  before I met him  and he can't handle worrying about me now all the time if I'll relapse   Which is a pretty shitty deal if you ask me  because I can't possibly not do things I already did   So I'm having a really fucking bad time today  but I haven't drunk neither will I  in the next hours before bed   Thanxx so much to everyone who has comment replied recently    I haven't checked them in a few days  but I will tomorrow    I even forgot to pay rent and some bills  that's what kind of a shitstorm it's been   x  EDIT ADDED   I think the most fucked up part of all of this is that it all started a few days ago  when I told him how I had just done my Daily Check In here and was on my first 15 days in a row in three years   "HOLY SHIT HE HAD NO IDEA WHAT KIND OF A RECOVERING ADDICT TIMEBOMB HE HAD ON HIS HANDS   HE HAD NO IDEA I HAD BEEN THAAAT BAD "  Fucking Wonderland  if ever there was one  Congratulations  Weird question  but have you noticed people being extra nice to you since quitting  I'm not sure if it has to do with putting out a more positive friendly vibe  or just being more in tune to the world around  But I've been getting random discounts on things I buy  extra food for free  people reaching out  smiles  etc  for no reason all the time  Could also just be the holidays  but it's something strange I've noticed   I'm in the exact same boat  Lesson learned  Let's do this for the last time   Oooooh yeah  He got militant about dying in your sleep on it  I'm like uhhhhh the equivalent of 2 beers and 20mg of Valium  I drank so much I was seeing ghosts in the grocery store when the meet wagon when you guys got me   You will be amazed at how much healthier you will be and feel after 30 days  Alcohol in excess  even at just 1 2  drinks a day  is so much worse for the body than I realized  Stopdrinking is not affiliated with Aa  but I can't recommend it enough  Aa comes in all shapes and sizes  I go to a lawyers group and an agnostic atheist women's group   Tonic water  Hmm    Quiene gets me higher I always figured to stay away from grapefruit and tonic water while sick  I figured it would open the receptors and get me sicker  That's a good idea  I tend to forget the simple things like writing that list when I get stuck in my ruts  I should set an alarm in my phone  Lol  thanks for the reminder   And yes  Roller coaster about sums it up perfectly   I had a realization early on that I could decide what to focus on at meetings  I could spend the whole time staring at the God language in the steps and picking other stuff apart  or I could listen for things I could relate to and try to learn how to stay sober  It really is a decision I make to just set aside my feelings about organized religion  Been sober about two years now  still don't really like organized religion but to be honest I rarely even think about that when I go to meetings these days  AA has helped me a ton   If you relapse  make sure you relapse with flower and not with wax  That shit is terrible for you  The pharmacy almost wouldn't fill my librium script last time because it was so heavy    I'm like uhhh I once chased 60mg Ativan with a fifth of vodka  I'll be okay   Exercise is amazing  I think dr  Moonpickle hit it  This   My past is invaluable  including the regrets and painful parts    If   I use it to inform my choices rather than obsess about what I "coulda" "shoulda" done  Walk 5 miles every day for 1 year  will achieve this on May 19 if I don't stop     Get a 6 pack  and I don't mean beer       he told me that his body needed the alcohol to prevent seizures  which he has never had in the past while detoxing   panic attacks  and other side effects of coming down from alcohol binges   This is true       He made me believe it was a better alternative than the hospital      but not this  Crazy  I can't even imagine what life will be like in 9 years for me   Thank you for the response  See that's what scares me  I've kicked dope habits before and take a few days off work and by day 10 or 11 I'm feeling wonderful  This whole 90 days being sick has me worried  A friend who got on subs a year before me just kicked from  5mg and he couldn't do it  started getting high for 3 weeks to kill the sick  and that's exactly what I'm trying not to do   I don't know about you specifically  but multivitamins are wasted on just about everyone except alcoholics   Let's hear why you think wax is terrible for you  You are almost there  too  Congrats  Let's not smoke tonight  When your comfortable you can tell whoever  however you want   I would suggest you ask your friend to go with you to a meeting    Be very careful  Oxy for an dental extraction is overkill even for a non addict  Take Advil  A little discomfort is worth it versus getting strung out on opiates   and suffering through a withdrawal that is pretty intense    Don't psych yourself out  Distract yourself and get rid of the pills  You might feel off for a day  but this is a case of mind over matter    I'm sorry to hear this  But   I'm glad that you're thinking all this through and making an attempt to improve yourself  I find that it does help to be grateful for those things we  do  have    Relationships are so hard  and especially when one or both partners have personal issues to work through  I just ended a pretty toxic relationship where I decided that  after 2 years  I could no longer support my partner through her anger emotional issues  and that she was going to have to solve them by herself  on her own time  I hope for her sake  that she does    A big piece of advice that I hear a lot on this sub is that we have to put recovery first   before relationships  before our job  before everything  When we do that  it's a lot easier to tackle the other things in life  Good luck to you and I hope you find what you need   Eh two years ago people were also saying the sub had turned to shit   And word my bad I really don't keep up with people very much on this sub  Yeahhh I can't imagine isopropyl    No judgment but ouch   Meditation and exercise helped me a lot with the anxiety   the Seroquil had me sleeping through the night  instead of waking up screaming sometimes three times a night  for the first time in years  I'm not sure  but it's possible that your bad dreams may have been severe enough to get a diagnostic label and proper medical treatment   They may have either been  sleep terror disorder  https   en wikipedia org wiki Night terror  or  nightmare disorder  https   en wikipedia org wiki Nightmare disorder    Sleep terrors normally happen during NREM sleep   Nightmares usually happen during REM sleep   Both disorders are treatable   The treatments may be different for each one   Don't try to diagnose yourself   Get a doctor  psychiatrist  or psychologist to do it   You may have a secondary disorder  not a primary disorder  and so the treatments may be completely different than what the Internet says   Clearly the Seroquel resolved the bad dream problems  but Seroquel may cause some unpleasant side effects  e g  weight gain and other effects   and so you may not want to remain on it forever   There may exist other effective treatments which can keep the bad dreams away while producing fewer side effects   Ask a doctor   P S   Melatonin pills may make nightmares worse   You  considering your situation  should never take such pills unless a doctor says it's okay for you to take them   P P S   I'm not a doctor  just an IT consultant   This is not medical advice   Talk with a doctor  Have enjoyed watching him on the local NPR TV station   Yes  it is very difficult to change an addictive behavior and just as difficult for some one who does not have an addictive behavior to understand why we do the things we do   Hell  we even have difficulty understanding why we do what we do   And  as you said  that is why this place exists    Allow me to pontificate a bit   AA doesn't not have a corner on recovery   There are many different paths to recovery  find one that works for you     I was fortunate enough to find one that works for me   Personally I don't care what  means of recovery someone else uses  as long as you can find a way to stop killing yourself with alcohol  good    I also want to address the idea that AA is a cult   It isn't    However there are some people in AA who treat it as a cult and I don't agree with them or their practices     The simple fact is that you can grab a copy of the book  Alcoholics Anonymous  adopt the design for living outlined in it and apply to your life  with or without the fellowship of others and have a pretty good life  sober    It's nice to be able to sit and chat with others who have done it  or are living it  but you can do it alone     It is my opinion though  that until you get honest with yourself about why you drink  you will continue to to drink  even after periods of abstinence where you think you got it licked       If you suffer from alcoholism like I did  do whatever it takes to get and find a way to stay sober   I have been to way to many funerals for people who are unique in dealing with their alcohol problem   Omg i feel you on being worried   Snowboarding and booze was very intertwined for me too  but I had my first successful snowboarding trip a couple weekends ago and it was actually more fun    Cheers to sober riding     For me  getting off benzos first was a better choice  The depression associated with benzo withdrawals is unbearable and kratom was amazing at alleviating it  Everybody is different though  Talk to your doctor if in doubt  My doctor had me tapering off both substances at once for good while and then got me off benzos first and then kratom  My doc was very knowledgeable about kratom which is rare  Best wishes    Thank you sir  I'm happy to hear  That's cool  good to know it's different in your area  My mum started starving me when I was 9  I had to document what I ate in a big chart on the fridge  The humiliation was constant    If you'd asked her at the time she'd've said she was helping me not get bullied at school  I was getting teased for being fat  I wasn't  but you know  kids     I emphasize with your situation and encourage you to find anyway you can to get the fuck out and cut contact  Long term  Short term   go stay with friends or other family    I stopped speaking to mum for two years because the relationship was so toxic  It's the best thing I ever did  It allowed a bunch of patterns to reset     She's since apologized and shown some serious remorse   long term healing is possible    I would also check out https   www reddit com r raisedbynarcissists   I'm sorry for your pain  Every one deserves a safe place to live    i tried to control my using and i always went back out   i had to stop using everything to get my life back   Just passed 7 years and I don't miss it at all   you can do it to  you just have to make that decision and act on it   hit me up if you want to talk   you can do this  What I did was I bought myself a pack of chewing gum and told myself that whenever I'll have a craving I would eat a gum instead of smoking a cigatette  Guess what  I didn't even open it  You just need to stay strong  It's mostly just in your mind  Try to not think about it  and kill this nasty habit right now    Reset my badge to 1 day  vowing not to drink today  Congratulations    Ooh  I would get this way as well  I would put on a DVD of my favorite concerts and blast the surround sound speakers  while singing along  My favorite was a U2 concert from Australia in 1993  I think I've watched it twice in the past year since I stopped drinking  when before I would watch it at least once a month   It does sound nice  Some people legit need to and I wish it were easy because I was probably one of those people  My work suffered heavily  more than usual  for a week  Things are much better now  i went to 0 5 mg every other day for a couple of weeks and got off with no withdrawal    There is so much I don't remember for much longer than 7 years  I really wish I could get those memories back  But  now my focus is to be present in the moment  I take a lot of pictures too       Haha  Thanks  Glad you are here  You can do this   If you feel like you're  going to hurt yourself  please seek help    As for the anger  God  i feel you on that much more than i'd like too  The first couple weeks after quitting were so hard  I wiuld feel just unending rage  Thankfully it mellowed out a lot and I'm  finding my emptions easier to cope with   I quit drinking and pot   I was smoking every day multiple x a day   Montana has some cheaper programs  One was 30 days in great falls montana for around 12k I think  Also  look at getting on insurance and see if it covers it   Glad to hear it   Stay strong  Awesome post  I will copy and paste portions of it into a running word doc with other posts from this sub that I find extra helpful  Thank you    Quick question  meditation  What do you do  Do you have any recommendations  I have an old sports therapist recording I listen to once in a while to chill out with  but I really think it would be beneficial to me to get into meditation  for my sobriety as well as general well being  What do you suggest  to start  I am a bit of a lazy ass and even though I have time  I always have time to waste  Any tips will be greatly appreciated   Major congrats on your one year  Kudos Lmao  Yes I have    Someone randomly bought my kids and I dinner the other night at a restaurant    went to pay and the waitress said that someone that wishes to remain anonymous already got it  First time that's ever happened to me  Wasn't a few nights later I was standing in line at a gas station with my two little kids and the guy in front of us that didn't look like he had a pot to piss in  covered in tattoos and buying two 32oz beers turned around and gave each of my kids a  5 bill  Must be the vibe that being happy and sober puts out  Kratom turned me into a zombie weirdo that didn't wanna talk to anyone because I was annoyed by everything    I also just landed a new job that pays an additional  2 500 a week  Had all kinds of crazy shit happening to me since quitting  I've noticed that while on kratom I was just merely surviving dose to dose    now I'm actually LIVING   St pretty early in it  Like I think a fifth a day minimum is fairly standard tame amount for alcoholism  But being a hard up CA is gonna require a lot more than that  usually mjltiple bottles a day   drinking nonstop throughout the day     1 3 1 2 a fifth a night though really isn't too bad I think  Definitely an amount that can turn into a lot more over time but still now pretty small We have our family dinner on Friday night  so eat  All the rich foods  plus dessert and a Dry Sparkling soda  Then maybe an herbal tea and hot bath  In the summer  I'll skip the tea   bath and go for a swim  Turn in early with a good book    Great to hear  I'm currently training for a Half Math myself  Always good to exercise mind  body    soul equally particularly in the fight against alcoholism   Painful and nasty and the weirdest fucking buzz   I don't recommend  I'm similar  but different  I've realised that I drink to moderate my anxiety but the effect is the opposite  I may be subdued for a while while drinking but I awake at 2AM with a feeling of dread  even minor problems or challenges in life seem just insurmountable  In fact I actually know this now and try to ignore the thoughts  they'll be much less in the morning   Thing is  over time I feel drinking too much has had a negative effect on my attitude  anxiety and positivity  I'm also lacking energy and enthusiasm  despite being very lucky in life  love and career    The one thing I don't worry too much about is my health  despite long term overindulgence I seem to be in reasonable health  I had a full blood panel and liver test recently and it was A OK  When I expressed surprise to the Dr he said "imagine how great you'd be if you didn't drink   So  I also have a goal not to drink in January  here I am at day 2 5 and I'm hoping to be able to deal with stress better and re assess after this month    awesome   This last time I was taking 30 40g a day spread out over 3 4 doses  The physical part wasn't bad at all for me    it's the mental and fatigue that really tested my will  Honestly I hadn't even thought of that  Too wrapped up in self loathing  apparently  But it's probably true  I'm making a lot of changes lately  But I whined to my SO that I was unmotivated and useless and he said 'look at what you did today   You didn't drink  You didn't smoke  You went to work  That's like 3 really HARD things   Go rest  You deserve it '  Lol   I guess he's right  I always want the good things to happen in a hurry  I have to be patient with myself  right  I hope you have access to Allen Carr's book or videos  It's a damn shame that they are posted online and get pulled down  constantly  I think Carr would have wanted everyone to have access to his work   But there's also Joel http   whyquit com joel  book and he has videos and FAQs  and you can ride out a craving there for the first year and never read the same thing twice   Stay the course  I'll join you in not smoking tonight   Opioid   That is one of the reasons why the DEA wanted to ban kratom   They along with the FDA and other countries who have banned it do not know how to classify it   Although it works on opioid receptors they still do not want to place it in that family of drugs   It doesn't work the same as other opiates narcotics   If they were sure without a doubt kratom was an opiate  it would have been banned long ago   Find an AA meeting  Go to several in your community and get a home group  They go hand in hand for me   I don't think of myself as an alcoholic but as a "getting fucked up" aholic   Weed is my drug of choice   I'm 37 days sober from it   I was pretty good at moderating weed for a long time  but when I didn't smoke I drank heavily   Over the past 6 years I developed a full psychological addiction to weed  during which I rarely drank to excess  but stayed stoned every minute I wasn't at work   After quitting weed  I allowed myself to drink a bit as a crutch   Now the drinking is getting a little out of hand and I need to quit that while I'm ahead   I haven't been fully sober from both for 20 years   I'm kind of interested in seeing what that's like    r leaves is a great subreddit for support with quitting weed  very supportive and positive  friendly community  like SD  I know  right   Sorry for the late reply  My cravings never got too bad  I didn't use gum or anything else  It was cold turkey  For most people they are able to go through most of the day just fine  But you'll get cravings through triggers  If you can last through those five minutes when you're craving you're good  One of the big things that helped me was having a disposable toothbrush on me at all times  Because no one wants to smoke after they've brushed their teeth  It helped two fold because I had fresh breath and it helped undue the damage of smoking  It helped a lot with the oral cravings  I had a friend to call as well  That would help if I was drinking or I didn't have a toothbrush  She would talk me off the ledge when I felt I didn't have the will power   I never had nightmares though  I had a some sleepless nights  but once I got through the first few weeks I was fine  I slipped once after six months and has a drag and it reminded me of every glorious thing about smoking until I exhaled and became resolved in my decision to stay smoke free the thing is i remember them when i think back on it  or when something related happens  but memories like that are supposed to appear randomly or when youre happy  and lately i havent felt that  i felt like the last 4 5 years have been a blank   if that makes sense    ready to start remembering everything and creating new memories    tired of this fog Knock the shit off   then you won't have to tell her  The two are quite different with respect to their cause and effect on me   I have no quarrel with the ganja  but find myself wanting to keep a very clear head at this stage of my recovery   In the future  who knows      She's a woman so we all already know she's gonna be jealous   Probably not a great foot to start on  I'm pretty sure you would feel the same way if she was hooked on looking at "perfect" men   You addiction isn't particularly unique   it's just soft core porn  basically  If you want to quit  quit  If not  keep it private  I'm also on the smoke free app  great app  I like the count down progress  bars I'm 3hrs from getting my taste and smell back       OP  Keep at it and keep coming back here for help when needed   Haha that's awesome  I was wondering what was going on  It's been happening so much  A zombie is right  it makes you so disassociated with everything and everyone around you   and you don't even notice  Congrats on the new job and life  Hoping the new job thing comes through for me soon myself    Me too  I'm also a lawyer  Much of what you wrote resonated  but the expectations  waiting for the Big Thing to happen  and just being gobbled up by the mundanity  of it all  with only drinking to look forward to sometime  really hit home    Would love to hear more about how you approach your work now  Do you practice  A lot of my headspace at the moment revolves around weighing my  professional options  currently am a partner in a 7 lawyer firm       but not boring  Still plenty of action in the form of too much work and stress personally and professionally   It's small so it's easier to steal than 5ths or mouthwash  Also way easier than setting up a burn and return   Yeah  I am only on my second day   I have spent the majority of the time reading in bed and napping   Whenever I am starting to feel that listless boredom  I just make myself go to bed instead of trying to stay up and fight off urges     Welcome   I won't drink with you   I'll stick to stealing mouthwash and boxes of wine when desperate  Heh  x They suck   You're absolutely right and for me the first few days are literally minute to minute if not second to second   Hi  welcome out of lurking  Congrats on keeping the new year sober  It sounds like you have a good plan lined up  and this group is a great place to get support too  I'll not drink with you today  Hey Quark jet I remember you during my other two big kicks  I want my life back so badly  I feel fortunate that I was able to have that half year sober last time since prior to that with only a month or two under my belt  I never actually got "normal" feeling again  So I am trying to focus on how good that feels  Good job man  Really good job  Only been smoking for three years and am halfway through day one  It's hard Been there and done that    I can steal boxes of wine now though  I'm expert level klepto  Not something I'm proud of     It doesn't get any better out there in the drinking world  does it   I'm cautiously moving forward from a relapse that landed me in the ICU   At this point  I'm looking at my sobriety as a child I am raising  right now my sobriety is an infant  in need of constant care   nurturing    I just want to feed  love and care for her so that she can grow   flourish   Thank you for sharing this   It reminds me that alcohol has never been my friend    I don't want anything to do with it today   Rubbing alcohol won't get you drunk  It's the wrong type of alcohol  I could be wrong but I'm pretty sure    Glad you're feeling the difference already  Congrats on day 2  keep at it  if you did it once  you can do it again   we aren't perfect  so we just should shoot for doing the best we can   i know you can do this  you sound tired of the life   think of your future self and have empathy for them   allow them to thrive   hang in there and pm me anytime  I'm not saying it isn't doable  I know two people who quit them then this based off my success  Both made it and are happier    It just wears you out after awhile  THe lower you Taper the less the w d lasts  The first 30 are the worst  After that it gets easier   You can also find a lot of info on the subsux forum  Google it  you will find it   I honestly believe I jumped off at too high of a dose  I didn't know any better at the time  I didn't do the research until after I stopped taking them   You can do it    Sub free life is awesome   I'll never touch another of those nasty bastards again  Ever ever ever I wouldn't worry too much   each day does get a little bit better  for me it did at least    What you've described is pretty much how it was for my first 3 or 4 days  and then the fog started lifting toward the end of the first week   I completely relate   I can't recall events  usually only if there is a picture that is presented to me   My mind can't conjure up memories from the last 4 5 years it takes a concentrated effort to remember  whereas it didn't before I drank     The brain fog is too thick but what I do know is that this brain fog lifts the amount of time I stay sober  Maybe I will be able to recall more then if I am not pounding 8 12 beers a night    Basically  I feel you and I found a lot of myself in this post    In extremely short hand it used to help me deal with the fact that my mom is a narcissist  She gaslighted my entire childhood and when reality hit it hit very hard  It helped me deal  I still have my days that things she says really bother me but I have learned that smoking only makes my problems worse  It was a quick fix for a while but  dealing with this demon is better than having multiple demons to deal with for sure   I just hire dope heads to steal  100  150 worth of shit then I return it for a gift card at Walmart buy  150 of shit return that with the receipt and get cash  Give the fiend his  80 and spend  70 on booze for myself  Only can do 3 returns with no receipt every 6 months per store chain so I hire people to return for me as well  I ran a ton of liquor money schemes back when I was super poor homeless     Good times   Too late   Already posted   It was probably time  thanks for the update  i drank yesterday afternoon and need a badge reset  but my roommates understand and they're supporting me  so it's not the end of the world  still looking forward to 2017   Oh no  That sounds awful  But  the great thing about being an adult is that you can leave whenever you want to   You've made a great choice  Many of us consider quitting alcohol to be the best decision we ever made  It's not always easy but it's well worth it    I'll not drink with you today   I was just to drunk to post for a long time  You don't need to do it  You can take steps like getting rid of your gear  now  permanently  For me  not that I'm perfect now  but way better  getting some sodas or treats helps with taking my mind off  Good luck  you don't have to feel high and shitty about it ever again  Can't speak for OP  but for me I went cold turkey  The first step though was when I quit  in my brain  The next morning  I quit physically   That's the best way  You will decide not to be a slave to the addiction  You can do it  and we will all be here to help  I did not drink today    amazing  congratulations  that's an awesome achievement     Welcome and good luck  It's a great day to quit  You are so young  Your career will be just fine  Like others have stated  you need not give details about the resignation   A medical issue arose  you had to take care of it  The important part is that you get sober  I'll not drink with you   Same in my area Ah  yeah come to mention it caffeine is the devil in these early stages of quitting weed  I've subconsciously avoided coffee since stopping  ok  today  and am quite glad  I'm really into this ginger tea though   I am so tired of this life  I want my dignity back  It is so humiliating to have such a good job but be totally financially fucked and trying to hide it from loved ones  May I ask what your method was 7 yrs ago  I am frustrated because it is undoable for me to take off a good chunk of time to do the desired detox program that worked for me last time  I have methadone that I am going to replace my dope with tomorrow then taper off over a short period of time   I have been doing the tea thing too especially on my lunch breaks at work   I make a cup of tea instead of going out for a cigarette   Has helped me a lot during lunch  Thanks for the encouragement  If I can do it  so can you  We'll do this together  Oh I don't know about drunk but I definitely got fucked up on it  Like others said  unforeseen medical issues or unforeseen life circumstances should do just fine    When I first got sober  somebody told me that if I made staying sober my absolute number one priority  everything else in my life would be first class  I've found that to be true  AA taught me that I could stay sober through anything  and I found that as I stayed sober one day at a time  everything that I thought was an insurmountable issue early on tended to work itself out when I stopped trying to force a solution on it    So yeah  worrying about your bills will not get them paid any faster  Instead  focusing on staying sober will allow you to get and keep a job that will pay those bills  That's what worked for me       How to Pronounce Suboxone  0 11     http   youtu be 66g1Ia5G sU     Learn how to say words in English correctly with Emma Saying free

literally no fog and for the most part I am fully present   Same  Friday evening gymming is the tops  So empty  so many gainz   But is it really  You made it much further than most of the people who want to quit  KEEP GOING  The last time I saw you responding was 2 hours ago so I'm assuming you drifted off to sleep by now   It is a tough road  but as you've read from others  it is doable    but only a day at a time     Someone suggested breaking it down to hours or even minutes if you have to   Small bite size pieces you can chew off   Not the 100mph pace you described    I know we are suppose to comment in the "I" so    I have not gone to AA but want to but I'm afraid   I have been and still do see a therapist   I have still not fully disclosed my alcoholism publicly except here   People are starting to guess but I have an excuse about training for my next race  which is true   I do feel so much better now when I exercise and race     I want to make a point that I think was not covered  withdrawal   I would advise you to be careful   If you were drinking as much as you say and are as petite as you describe  you might have some withdrawal issues  Now that you are sober and continuing on that path  you can listen to your body a lot easier    Be careful as these first days can be rough    Weather the storm as the grey clouds will part      You said you are considering AA  that's great as you are braver than me    Might you consider a therapist too   Not sure where you are but some insurance companies cover counseling or even some jobs will cover a few visits    The fact you're here is proof you are wanting to change  now it's time for the willingness to change   I stopped and slipped many times   Each time I learned something and was able to do better the next time   I came really close this weekend on NYE  but I had a vision     my rock bottom     and I quickly righted myself      I look forward to seeing a 2 by your name tomorrow  as I'm not going to drink with you today    Honestly  unless you NEED to quit ASAP I'd recommend tapering slowly  I tapered over 2 months until I was taking minuscule amounts and wasn't counting down the hours  Then one day I forgot to take it to work and went a day without it  Found out I didn't care  so the next day I went without it  After that I didn't even think about kratom  I had absolutely zero withdrawals  and I was a pretty heavy user before I started tapering  I was at around 3 years I think and was taking 40g a day  5 hour energies help me A LOT too  I'm sure they aren't healthy  but I was taking kratom for energy and pain and it definitely helps with both  Yeah  I get that  but like you said I had to prove to myself that I meant it this time  It was like physically difficult to do that but I'm glad  I could have given it to somebody else to hold but then I'd know it was out there   I'm sure you understand     Searches furiously with one hand       i got on subs because i couldn't miss anymore work  but the dr  i went to had us go to meetings   I thought wtf  i will try it because nothing else worked   i went to a meeting a day for 90 days and tried to set aside my preconceived notions about the program   i got off the subs in 9 months  but kept going to meetings   i still go to 2 or 3 a week because they still help me and i like to meet new people who want to get off and stay off   I'm not saying it works for everyone  but it certainly worked for me    Happy 2017    I don't spend a lot of time on reddit these days  but when I do  this sub is my first stop  And your post is exactly the reason why      The improvements will continue    Thank you for sharing your story  it's as important for the starred quitters  as it is for the new year's quitters  You inspired me  I'm going to not smoke tonight   Thanks dude  I really really appreciate it  LMK how your journey is going in a DM or something if you want  Having just one  is like jumping out of an airplane over an ocean of cigarettes   We don't hit the ocean immediately  but we will  and be stuck in it again for months or years     I had to make this mistake alot to finally see it   But that doesn't stop the temptations   When they come  I just tell myself there is no "one"  there's only full blown relapse    then commit to finishing the day   Good luck  So a little over a year averaging 4 8g daily  I'd taper if I were you  I'm a much bigger fan of tapering than ct if you can control yourself  Tapering will land you down softly  Allow you to sleep  eat and be functional  I also think It lowers the chance for any major relapse as ct can be tough sometimes  So forst  jump back to your single morning dose for 4 days or so  Then maybe drop 0 25g every day  Or you can drop 0 5 1g and then maintain for 4 days ish  I prefer the former since there's less shock to the system  If it gets too much  just maintain at whatever your at for a couple days until youre ready to drop again  To be honest  I think it will be quite easy for you  especially considering you've been able to not increase your dose for over a year  So don't fear man  it'll be way easier in comarison to other opiates  All the best  You can do it  Great way to start the new year That sounds killer being up to what you were to  That just sounds fucking insane  Stay strong  Update back It's smart to set your intentions for the week  You've got this  A couple months' lapse in work can be finessed  You could say you took some time to pursue other interests  decided it wasn't a good fit and wanted some time to fully devote to a search for a better position  or just that you wanted to spend time with family  Either way  you can make it something that's true but not the full truth  That's the easy part   The hard  and to the point  more important part is  what's the plan to stop drinking  Changing jobs can be very stressful in any circumstance  but for me the most important thing by a long shot was figuring out how to stay sober in the early days  I found this sub  AA  meditation  journaling  exercise  and a number of other things pretty essential early on  and frankly   that took up most of my free time   Gradually I got back to a point where I could work  but the sobriety had to be super solid first  What resources do you have to put sobriety into action  Oh no  you're totally fine man  You've been clean for a very long time  This one slip won't set you back at all  You may feel a little lethargic and irritable tomorrow  but that is it  Don't worry    I'm partially into a book called "a path with heart" and I'm really finding it helps with many aspects of my life   Ice cream  The anxiety and tremors are very real  I was shaking so bad today I couldn't even enter my debit card pin at the grocery store  My legs even started shaking really bad and I went into a full blown anxiety attack  I was a complete mess  I did purchase alcohol  but this sub is helping me   I consider myself sober since 4 months and I still smoke maybe 2 3 puffs per day    No more  because I really don't like being too high  I get anxiety and often I feel depressed almost like when I was still drinking  But thankfully  it lasts maybe 2 3 hours and you feel pretty much normal after that  Maybe it's having a negative effect on my body  but I don't feel it at all  The thing with weed is that there is a really thin line between too high and just Ok  if you try it  go slowly and wait 20 minutes between each puffs  I dont want to give smoking advices here but anyway  I felt like you needed that information   But to be really honest  I feel like I use it like a crutch because I'm still afraid of alcohol  I know that I'm not really honest with myself when I say I'm sober  Even if it's only 2 3 puffs  it's still an addictive substance and I know it's dangerous for me in particular  Even tho I dont feel the negative effects like alcohol   Thanks  I did  I tapered down for the past 3 months  The hardest part is sticking to your quit date  On my original quit date I said to myself I'll just smoke one last time  Then the next day I had an anxiety attack when I woke up and smoked again  One month later I was still smoking  Finally my family went on a trip and I didn't smoke  When I got back I said to myself "I feel good and since I haven't smoked I should just keep going " I'm at the end of day 3  I know I will have some hard days but I'm happy I did this on my own terms  I feel the same way  please don't smoke  You guys here on r leaves are one of things keeping me from smoking  Stay strong for not only you but for everyone in the same boat   Thanks for sharing man  Best wishes   I feel the same way  please don't smoke  You guys here on r leaves are one of things keeping me from

is definitely doable  But if you want it to be smooth as possibly  maybe just drop 0 5g of your daily total every day  If it gets hard  just maintain wherever you're at  Good job for catching this soon Thank you for sharing   You have illuminated quite a few aspects that I struggle with in my own life that become potholes in my sobriety   A lot of the good stuff you have mentioned is what I would like to have for myself and my future   In a somewhat same but different situation to you I have been very lucky to have experienced a couple of the Big Things in my life but let them pass by as I didn't feel that I deserved them    I hope that in the future I can allow good things into my life gracefully and with appreciation  to enjoy and share with others simple goodness   You have given me much to think about    Carr's book isn't that much about not smoking  In fact  he encourages you to smoke the entire time you read the book  It's more about pointing out some really obvious facts about what you go through when you do smoke  I quit via Carr  but also relied on this sub  and joel's library on WhyQuit org   Pistachio nuts in the shell are great  keeps those hands busy crackin' rather than lighting up a cigarette   Please join me  tonight we're all not smoking  I'm with you  I have the exact same fears  Best of luck   Touching the Void  It is a great book about a

comments 5kzbqn homeless man turned his life around today and dbrz8ff    We're under no obligation to be the same person we were yesterday   I have so many regrets  and I have days like you're having  I have a couple of go to things that get me through those days  I practice mindfulness  Whether I'm depressed about hitting 40 or dwelling on stupid crap I've done in the past  interrupting myself with  "This is where I am today " pushes me back into the present  It's not about judging where I am today or feeling good about where I am today  it's about accepting where I am today without judgement  I also think about all the opportunities and time I do have left  I don't want to squander the next 40 years    It's not everyone's bag  but I'm reminded of the "Raymond K Hessel" scene in Fight Club  I don't condone the method  but the message strikes a chord with me  I can't get the time back  but there's nothing stopping me from being what I might have been  to paraphrase George Eliot  They give you cash  I run that too but they put it back on a card and it's 5x per year    Under  25 they give you cash here though   Hey man  thanks for your persistent posting  It's really helpful   Amazing  well done   Great idea  Also I have had no withdrawal symptoms after tapering down  It really was a great choice 257 down  At least 1 to go   Yes  Also tired of the humiliation of other people finding them  Props for keeping your dose low  It will make your journey quite easy  But you were only clean for a week before  how much were you using before that for the 2 years  If anything  I think you will have more psychological symptoms than physical  Same thing kinda happened to me  Although I relapsed for a few months at way higher doses  this time my physical symptoms are minimal  but mental game is tough I did forget Febfast  That's a big one  Yes   I forgot all about these things  Armison  Orange juice  especially is great  I kept eating candy  and pistachios   When I quit there was an awesome thread about farting  constipation  headaches  and all the really weird things we could expect as we became non smokers  Wish I could find it to repost  I tried to keep it classy   Lol Something I've heard is religion is for those who don't want to go to hell and spirituality is for those who've been there   Religion doesn't appeal to me  Spirituality appeals deeply  Ooooooooh I like that   And also it makes me feel crappy about all the things that I haven't made a priority  Lol   Oops  Seriously though that's very powerful  Thank you  I love Nothanksvember  I was going through that 442 days ago  so I can't currently commiserate  but I do understand all too well  Baby yourself right now  I drank a lot of sleepytime extra tea and gatorade or pedialyte  I also got a multi B supplement and had a scrip for ativan from my doctor which helped with the worst of it  Posting and reading on here will help the time pass too  You never need to go through this again  Best wishes  I used to make my parents proud I used to be the glue that kept my friends together now they don't talk and we don't go out   Ughhhhhh just stab me right in the part of my brain that makes me feel guilty why don't you   Get some clean urine from someone   Why not try at least   You're fucked anyways    Haha  In Oz   It does seem to be a big thing here even amongst my heavy drinking friends   Don't know if they see out the month though  Hmm     Not sure  I have an IUD that I've had for going on 10 years   I don't really know what to compare my periods to  and I rarely pay attention to flow  I'm hoping to    I asked for measurements in case things don't work out with current BF   I recognize and appreciate you  I'm not one to shake my fists at the newbies  as I was one myself  but  damnit  I'm not seeing quality content lately  I just can't relate as much anymore  We need an SCA  Super crippled blah blah   and a SDCA  Super duper blah blah  There is a spectrum  It really does matter  Incredible story  Stay strong my friend   Don't know how to respond to the original experience  I successfully tapered from about six drinks  wine  every day to none  I did 5 5 4 4 3 3 2 2 1 1     none  I wasn't worried about ramping back up  for myself  I think the only downside is that I didn't experience ANY withdrawal  so I don't have that to fear  I'm a little over a month sober  I kind of quit by accident  just trying to not replace alcohol and think about what I really wanted when I wanted a high  I thought a break might be good for a bit  Remarkably  my anxiety disappeared completely  I guess that's not a surprise considering the connection between the two  But it was mindblowing to me  I hung on to my weed and weed accessories for about 6 months before I gave them to a friend in a different city   Since you said AA helps  have you asked your sponsor this question  First thing   maintaining your sobriety is paramount   The slippery slope is now a cliff  Do not skimp on efforts there   Meetings can be places to network  discretely afterwards    Second  your body and mind may take some time to recover and rebound     Third   the good news is that you are not alone in this   drastic lifestyle changes may be required   things may be lost but you can survive   You will need to ask for help and to earn it this is where continued sobriety is a requirement   Help dries up very quickly for those abusing trust   You may be eligible for some disability benefits help  rehab  though this can be double edged and on the record    Perhaps after a rehab you could reapply at your old company but you would need somone who believes in you   Or maybe a simpler life   I don't know   I do know that right now sobriety is your biggest asset      Same here  I haven't drank in 22 days  but I've got at least a dozen bottles hidden around in various locations  Some may even still have alcohol in them  I don't care  Don't want it   You can do this  Get clean  Thanks for your share as well  You helped me today  Yikes  the fact that it's affected u so much and at such a low dose is pretty scary  it's amazing u kept it down that low  U could be up to the 50  gram and extract habits that's a lotta folks are dealing with  Hopefully your symptoms won't be bad  I took Kratom for a while back in the day  like '05 '06   wayyyy less than the massive amounts I've been taking the past two years    probably close to what you're on  I quit it because I didn't have anymore and back then  stores didn't have any  I had read and 100  believed that it wasn't possible to get w d from it   and I didn't have any problems whatsoever  Makes me wonder how much of our suffering is created in our brains when we expect a specific outcome  U may be fine    Good luck    Yep  I've taken some time off as well  and things will be starting for me again  albeit gradually  tomorrow  As difficult as getting through Christmas was at times  I realized that I probably quit at the best possible time  I think the real challenges for me are ahead  I'll be here every chance I get  Congratulations   I too  did not know what my game plan was going to be when I quit   Was it temporary or permanent   Nobody is more surprised than me that it is now permanent   I love life without alcohol    Life is too short and I love that I will be present for every moment for the rest of my life and not lost in some haze   I wish you continued happiness   You smell really nice for awhile       As an aside  when I was in high school  I used to just rub some vanilla extract in my scalp and wrists like perfume   Still do  for old times sake  every now and again   But back to the topic at hand  you can put quite a bit in hot sugared coffee before it's completely gross     Thanks for the advice   I would like to weigh out all my doses for the next day the evening before   I'm just wondering if anyone else did it this way   If so  how did you store the doses   I may end up getting some capsules for this purpose  but am open to other ideas on storing just the powder if that makes any sense    Wait until you're a couple weeks on your meds  that's when they really start to take effect  And yes  alcohol and depressants negate their effects  Keep up the good work  But you yourself are so new I'm confused  It is bad  Its annoying Congratulations  Lol  special snowflake  Love it  I also love that you are listening  I'm sure others feel the same  which is great   He stole my Baby Jesus Butplug  Fuck him   Congratulations on a sober trip around the sun  That's awesome  Must feel great     I will not drink with you today  Would you consider it cheating  If there is nothing wrong with it  why do I feel guilty  Congrats on 15 days  Looking forward to having a two with a circle around it like you  I like cardio  currently the bike is my new buddy  I also use weights  but no power lifting for me  And swimming   My gym has a pool  Helps me to relax   Hmmm    dirty bastard  what about the Horrid sound of the recycle bin being emptied  My first porn related memories come from around third grade  so I guess I was about 7 or 8  I was over at a friend's house  and my friend had a computer with internet access while I didn't yet  I think the kid's parents didn't quite understand what was all on the internet  and that letting five third grade boys use it unsupervised for hours was probably not the best idea  And it wasn't super vanilla stuff we were looking at  it was mostly animated games that had like tentacle rape and massive cumshots and stuff  I'm pretty sure the exposure to that at the time my sexuality was either just starting to or just about to develop was not too great for me   I didn't start actively seeking about real hardcore porn until like 6th grade  so when I was about 10 or 11  I remember it was around then because I had a friend in class and we used to email each other porn links and stuff  was very weird when I think about it   I think I started to see it as a problem when I was a junior in high school and found myself with about 80 or so gigabytes of porn on my computer  most of which I had never actually watched  but I was saving because I liked the girls and thought I might want to watch those clips at some point   Funny enough  although my fetishes have gotten much weirder as the time passed  there are still pornstars that I remember from when I was first starting to masturbate  and even vanilla stuff with them can give me ridiculously intense orgasms  Sharing my experience  strength and hope helps me stay sober  and this is one of the places where I do that   The other thing I like might sound a bit weird  but I like reading about the newcomers who are struggling so much to break through the wall of denial and refusal to change anything about their lives  It's humbling for me because while things are going smoothly for me now  I'm reminded that if I don't continue to take care of myself  I could easily end up where they are  which is where I was before I got sober myself about two years ago  I read some of these posts and I think man I'm so grateful that I'm not dealing with that tonight  and the only reason I'm not is because I was desperate enough to take a few suggestions  So I think I'll keep doing what I've been doing  which is AA and lots of therapy at the beginning  less often these days  And maybe something I say can help break a few people out of that cycle of shame  denial and more drinking   Or a CA meeting   I do like NA though   I personally go to NA far more often than CA  This is the second time I have commented on this subreddit  The first was a few months ago when I thought I was done    and I thought wrong  I relapsed  I started smoking again and wayyyyy overdid it  I started using again  and I went from smoking maybe once a week before I tried to quit the first time to using almost every day after I relapsed  My lungs  my memory  and my sober mental health all went out the window    The other night  I smoked so much that I was taken to a different place in my head  a place full of fear and confusion  regret and anguish and depression and destruction  It was at that point that I realized what I was doing to myself  I told myself I had to stop again  but I smoked a few more times after that  and even though it wasn't ever such a high dose as that night  each trip was accompanied by the same senses of pain and loss and regret   I still have half a gram of dabs in my desk  within arm's reach at this point  I've reached for them  And each time  I had to remind myself of the horrors that I had experienced and the reason I am where I am right now    I don't know if you've had any experiences like that  and I don't know if I sound too melodramatic  but those are things that have happened to me    Relapsing might feel good in the moment  but over time the regret will envelop your soul  Writing is a good catharsis for me  and part of the reason why I'm leaving such a long ass paragraph is in an attempt to harden my own will to stay clean  Keep posting  brother  or sister   Stay strong  U are FINE  Just don't take anymore  It's not even possible that it would put you back to the mental hell you were in  Shake it off  It's all fear  False Evidence Appearing Real  However  watch your back soooo close  As u know  addiction is a sneaky monster  Sounds like you survived some rough times getting off K and u DO NOT WANT to go back there    I drank on dec  30 after 54 days sober     2 martinis and a few glasses of wine     I was with with my wife's family and everyone drinks and I just followed along  although I'm not exactly sure why I succumbed to that urge   I have certainly fought more powerful urges   I guess I had an ok time  but I woke up with a rough hangover and was reassured when I realized I liked sober me better   So I am back with my drink of choice   soda with a lime     I guess I can live with 56 57 days sober today and not beat myself up too much     Not resetting the badge   Is that OK  I know you feel it to be true  but you're wrong about that  You  can  stop  It's not going to be easy  and it may not stick the first time you try  but you can  You're strong and more than capable    There is so much support in this community  that it's mind boggling  Stick around  and I think you'll find that you will learn a lot  gain confidence  and feel less alone and helpless   Honestly  as someone who has always hid it as best I could  the very freedom of not having to hide this beast is very freeing  I hope that's a positive experience you can share while just starting out   I wish you all the luck in the world  Be strong and persistent   You can do this  really and truly   My tits are massive enough as is   It took me over three months to piss clean  and I'm not massive  I was 123lbs at the time  I started smoking at 16 though    I feel like I should probably make more posts instead my stories tend to end up in comments of other people's posts   But sometimes that's just too much fucking work   And everything in my life is so fucking crazy right now   It's hard to put into words  I actually have a good bootlplug story  You wanna hear it  Congratulations  Just stick them in your pockets  really  Yeah  we raise a glass for Harambe   It feels so good to when I hit that pillow sober  I know that I made it through another day  I am not going to wake up with a hangover  I am not going to wake up with the shame  Let's do it again tomorrow  I won't drink with you   You need to post pictures of the sex bruises on your boobies  That's the only way to tell if its alcoholism and not deadly SPACE AIDS  Ur right  I forgot about the Epsom baths  They do help   And u don't have to detox off the epsom later on    I was around 5 15 a day  not using aids to quit   Thank you  so much   Yeah  there were some things about the Seroquil I didn't like  weight gain  extreme sleepiness during the day  and lack of motivation   I have a doctor's appointment on the 9th   I'll bring this up    I do want to say though that the Seroquil worked almost like the Vivitrol shot for me  only better   Seroquil took away all my withdrawal symptoms   and when I did relapse  the heroin didn't feel good hardly at all   I was beginning to move on with my life  and was counting clean days until I could get the Vivitrol shot for real   I fought the Vivitrol shot at the hospital because I wasn't ready to quit     Seroquil was like baby steps that got me clean "on my own time" and let me disconnect the act of using with how good it felt to get high    Edit  2  All my nightmares were related to PTSD trauma  so I was just diagnosed with simple PTSD   Can I have those disorders and PTSD   Are they different   I know  those are probably questions for my doctor  But if you want to quit for good why would you bother with all this elaborate personal testing   Why wouldn't you pursue the path that is most likely to result in your quitting   The "test of will" is achieving the goal that's important to you   Quitting and staying quit  I get crap like this at meetings from time to time  But as long as I look outside of myself for an answer to how I feel inside I am using incorrect logic    I e   Don't let one idiot's opinion turn you off from an entire area of life  Agreed  rule your desires or they will rule you  Great NDV  Cake in a hot bath sounds wonderful  Same  I feel like the pose   squishing my guts   combined anxiety that comes with obsessive behaviors and the need to complete them contributes to that feeling   Just read your post   Thinking and praying for you  I am a single mom also  Your story sounds very similar to mine stopping drinking will help so much  One time  I got a phone call that my son thought it would be funny to twirl a can of paint over his head  The still full can of paint I had used the day before and lightly tapped the lid on because I was going to use it again soon  Guess what happened    I drank wine    And there is STILL paint all over my garage    So  your cake in the tub was the best decision   Very proud of you  u EnlightenedAddict Everything isn't great to smoke long term  But your lungs can be healthy after smoking flower or wax for years  If you smoked cigarettes you'd be in far worse shape  Consider reading up on topics that can help you work through a major lifestyle change  I haven't read a book since I started smoking heavy the last 3 months  I started The Alchemist today  I think relative to the time I've spent getting high I should spend some time trying to learn to do things differently this go round  Exercise  Diet  Sleep  Structure  Awareness Support   Keep doing the thing   Good luck to you too  friend  We Are  indeed  I can absolutely relate  so many nights at this time  I'd be eyeing up the rest of the bottle of wine  forgoing water for that last glass  I'm toasting you with LaCroix  WHOAA    Welcome fellow mid 30s person  It's time for me to take some more responsibility for myself and looks like you're in the same place  This sub is a great help to me and others  B t w   anxiety and panic attacks are also side effects of antidepressants  Maybe there are similarities    Things I did when smoking marijuana  watch cartoons  eat junk food  drive around  that was a really bad decision   smoke more marijuana  procrastinate  Things I do while sober  exercise  meditate  read  study  learn  play music   actually get things done that I need to do   It really does feel good knowing that I'm not putting a lid on my mental growth any more  Deal  I actually have no choice but to wake up early the next 3 days  So I'll let ya know I too realized that I couldn't stop  I had no idea how to go longer than a week or is  It stood that the next logical thing was to ask others what to do  I started seeing a therapist and attending meetings  where I met people who could show me how they quit  It wasn't easy to admit that I had no idea what to do  but it was the best thing I ever did   I really do  These are fantastic suggestions  all  Thanks for starting the conversation  I love Insight Timer and really enjoyed Refuge Recovery  Looking forward to following up on the rest of these  Congratulations on your year  KOTM  and thank you for the witty and honest insights  LaCroix is LIFE    When I hear people using street slang on reddit  it reminds me of the     outtakes at the end of Being There      https   www youtube com watch v sdQUAsZaCoI feature youtu be t 46  where Peter Sellers tries repeatedly to relate the message to Rafael  sign me up  Haha funny you ask  I literally just got done measuring out doses for the next 2 days  I just use sandwich baggies  I used to make capsules and loved it more than toss and wash  Then my parents threw away my capsule maker on accident  Pshh  But yeah I just use sandwich bags and label them No its just magnesium citrate I believe  Actually a lot of people are magnesium deficient too so it will benefit you to keep an eye out for that anyways  I missed you guys too As the treasurer at an AA group let me tell you how we do donations  We don't force them  We pass a basket  If you don't donate that's fine  At the end of the quarter I pay the church  250 for rent  buy a couple new books and coins for newcomers  and give the rest  usually between  20 100  to a local food shelf   I used to drive very drunk a LOT  I still feel so guilty and ashamed    I can't believe I never got a DUI or hurt anyone  I am so incredibly lucky  And so are you  I've had things happen since I stopped just like you    where I go "omg that could have been so much worse a year ago " Those memories of the many mistakes I made and my guilt alone are enough to keep me sober  Thanks for sharing  It's good to know I'm not alone   Some badass sushi and hot tea A glass  Is that what we usually raise for harambe    Days   I did the same thing  I was using 40  grams a day and toss and washing them  About 6 7 weeks ago I started to cap them myself  I use 00 capsules and can get about  6 may be 7 of it pack them right enough  Alot cheaper and hella convient   I am now down to 17 x grams a day from 40   I use a scale to weight out all my caps  I make sure to multiply the weight of the empty 00 cap   12  by how many caps I'm using for the dose  Then I subject that from the total weight of the caps that are filled to get an exact reading on how many grams is in that dose   I made a chart  Here is an example   1 3  1  4 caps  2 33 grams 2  5 caps  2 87 grams 3  8 caps  4 63 grams 4  T W 8 7 grams  I do this every night so I don't veer off course    I now toss and wash the first dose and my bed time dose now   It helps get me out of bed quicker and relieve my wd  And the bed time dose knocks out some of the anxiety by toss and washing   I've been having great success so far    I might as I also started taking 2 tbsp of black seed oil   cummin  cold pressex  with my night time dose and it makes it feel like I'm taking 13 grams  No lie  I also supplement with an complex vitamin and agmatine 1000mg  1 gram  1 or 2 times a day with doses   Also I make sure my bed time dose is a red strain    I was a 40  gram a day user for over a year and a half  So I'm thinking this is working  You will start to feel so much better when you get lower  Motivation will come back and you'll have ibtrest in things again  but not 100    Stick with it  It's hard  I veered off a few times and had a few binges due to holidays but went right back to my plan    Keep is updated  Stay positive   Feel free to msg me if you want to talk or have questions  Of love mutual support for both of us  I am starting today as well  Good luck   That is your addiction talking  When I get the negative self talk  I talk right back   all positive talk     Wow  That's an inspiring post man  I have been staying quit for around 150 days now  I have successfully broken up most of my associations and regularly keep an eye out for sudden cravings  I haven't got a craving in a very long time except for one during the NYs celebrations  Thankfully i didn't indulge  That was the closest i came to relapsing this time  I will be more vigilant from now on  Thanks for the post    I bought these  https

a great smoke pattern that is fun to look at  I toothpick too  I take the biggest handful of supplements every day  I can relate to the worrying issue  I have an OCD diagnosis as well  I've found that it's easier to replace a behavior than it is to get rid of one  A counselor or a physician would be great resource here  but if you're willing to prioritize sobriety  try going to a meeting or reading the posts here when the anxiety kicks in  Personally  I'm back down to 1 day because I relapsed when I stopped doing those things  I don't know if that helps  but I think you're probably in the right place  You've got this   I've been told it will  It's just EXCEPTIONALLY dangerous   I know that but I feel I'm so into my regular diarrhea routine that I know when I am and am not clean  Good for you  I have been a heavy smoker for about 20 years and just quit  for the third time  on NYE  I am definitely here to offer support as well  We can do this together   Upvoting intensifys  Now  get in here and FUCKING TELL IT LIKE IT IS   FFS   recovery is beautiful  never pretty   As I was doing yard work today  a thought hit me  I'm pretty damn excited to watch the entire Super Bowl this year and actually remember it all   Congrats to USC  That was a great Rose Bowl  Buy synthetic urine   OK  Buttplugs  "BUTTPLUGS"           Let us start at the end  "Oh  shit  I have to call her and tell her to take out the buttplug  FUCK " This is postmodern  I start with the end and then cut around a bit    So  So  So  This guy has a girlfriend  Nothing out of the ordinary there  She is into goofy sex  Par for course  He makes her wear a buttplug all of the time  To work  She goes to work  office job  buttplug  Like in her ass  Like a buttplug in her ass while she is working  answering the phone  getting coffee  etc    So  So  So  We are sitting at a table drinking beer  In the afternoon  A bunch of guys  Suddenly he has a "realization " "Oh  fuck  the buttplug  I have to tell her to take out the buttplug    "   Turns out he forgot to tell her to take out the buttplug  It was seven hours in to the day  She was grateful or happy or something    But the point is how it went down  "AHHHHHHHH  the Buttplug     " No one knew about this and we were just doing beers  And then "AHHHHHHHHH  the Buttplug    "   Note to everyone reading this  If you are forcing someone to wear a buttplug at work  remember to give them buttplug breaks   For me  Friday and Saturday nights were my drinking nights  To not drink would be seen as a good weekend wasted  since I wouldn't had been able to unwind    I'm only a week in  so we'll see     With that said on the eve before returning to work    the equivalent of a Sunday evening    I have my Calvin Harris blasting    something that would really only be reserved for unwinding moments    So  maybe an "ah cheers minute" can happen any time when not drinking    You do you    ahaha  I don't feel clean after messy ass piss though   Hey man  good to hear your going strong  Its a tough habit to quit  but I hope the rewards are well worth it   How did you become addicted to getting out of the house  I quit weed a month ago  mainly because it gave me too much anxiety to go out  Now I'm still finding it hard  especially cause I don't have many friends left  How did you do it  God  I know  Holy fucking heart stab  It's so incredibly beautiful  Brand New has always been one of my favorite bands though  they can do no wrong  Especially through Deja and The Devil and God   I'm sad that we lost  but happy that we held our own against powerhouse USC  What a game  That's why my homegroup is Agnostic  Cheers   with tea  I am finding Sunflower seeds and Tic Tacs to be great for cravings  I might try the toothpick thing  Thanks for the tip  I got a Sodastream for Christmas  At the rate I'm going  that canister is going to be empty soon  It's not so much the ass piss as that my ass piss is so regularly scheduled  12 30 PM to 2 PM  that I know what I'm dealing with to get cleaned up  Ah  yeah  I think I've done that once or twice  My moderation tactic is that I only drink on days ending in y   I haven't been around as long as some people but I wouldn't say I'm new either  I'm guessing you have multiple accounts too  why tf so many of you do that      I don't think it's that bad  It's in a few threads but just don't  other writing in those threads I suppose     I don't see a problem here   BOOM   Tic Tacs and Sunflower seeds  in the shell  have been working for me  You can do this  For anxiety  I use L Theanine   It is an amino acid and although it is mild  it can help take the edge off   Also  Valerian Root  I find the Valerian to be too relaxing for daytime use but it will affect everyone differently  It is a herb   Both of these are available at the health food store   Also  Chamomile tea   And of course  behavioural changes such as meditation and mindfulness and exercise   Let me know if going off the medication helps your digestive issue   I hope you can get some relief  This is hard enough to do with the added stress of taking a pill that is causing problems      Today was beautiful  It was so cold  but the sun was out  I was driving my car around with about an hour to kill and saw that someone was painting an enormous mural that covered an entire abandoned building that's been dilapidated and uncared for for a few years  One man had covered the entire thing with swirling colors and intricate patterns and in 12ft tall letters that wrapped around the corner of the building and took up two whole sides  were the words "I GAVE MYSELF TIME"  It put a lump in my throat  There are people who will know what that means  others that wont and some that will someday  Whatever our battle is  everyone has one   I keep 3 canisters on hand  I can definitely relate  I was in a cycle of drinking wine to wind down in the evening and having another glass and another glass  trying to be careful not to drink a whole bottle  My half drunk sleep was awful  My mornings lacked energy  I'm so glad to be done with that battle  I'm watching Netflix with chocolate ice cream and a tall glass of water  I'm gonna sleep well and wake up feeling ready for the day   I want to try out some new tea  Keep up the good work  Thx for posting  Well  I suppose that's convenient  Lol   Nice  Www benzobuddies com  Lots of great help there   You can sign up to properly read the posts and start reading to understand the issues  That is ducking incredible   and kinda hot too in a sick and perverted sort of way   I can't imagine 7 hours with a buttplug though   There's no way I could do this   not sober anyway  I was in almost the SAME exact predicament as you  I own my own biz and I'm unable to take off for work  I had a 160mg day oxy habit and I couldn't imagine being able to keep my work ethic up during WDs and Paws   I would recommend you go back on sub therapy if I were you  depending on where you jumped   I jumped at  25mg per day  and had kratom to help me 1 2x a day for heavy WDs and sleep deprivation   I don't necessarily recommend you go the kratom route   i think tapering subs down as low as you can go is probably your best bet  Maybe  25mg every other day  then every 2 days  etc  That  25mg is hella strong when you get to that point   I chose kratom only because the subs were giving me bad side effects  balding  tooth decay  low test  no emotions  etc    A lot of people will tell you to suck it up and go thru WDs  but that's not always an option  To me  going through 5 10  of WD for 6 months was better than going through full blown for a month  Woo Hoo  Not really up to us to tell you what you should do  but if it were me I would take a pretty hard look at what I could lose  for me it could be my self respect up to my life  and what I could gain  a few minutes of feeling good   Yeah we really need more doctors or pharmacists that have been there  In my head I was like yeah  I get it dude you had your got nurse give me 1mg Ativan an hour for the 4 hours I was here  I'm not going to go out and chug a pint of Seagrams 7 on the way home I can barely even walk to my buddy's car without looking like the ether scene in Fear and Loathing but I somehow doubt on day 3 that 50mg of Librium  a fairly mild benzo at noon and two light beers in the evening is totally going to kill me  it's going to let me eat some bomb ass food and get some rest and I should be good in a day or two  Man I get those thoughts all the time  I just turned 24 and it's hard being this young having to abstain from alcohol  I'm not sure if you had any major consequences from your drinking  but think of all that's become of you NOT turning to the bourbon    I don't get much of the cravings anymore  but I think about drinking ALL the time  If something I am so powerless over didn't cross my mind often I think i wouldn't take it as serious as I do  I think about it  think about all it's done for me  and why I don't need alcohol in my life   As far as not drinking for the rest of your life  I know it's cliche AA talk but take it one day at a time  You don't have to drink TODAY and that's all you need to worry about  No matter how much time in sobriety we have we're all one bad decision away from going back to our old ways    I always try to do the next right thing for the right reason  I asked a man with 50  years of sobriety how he was able to live the majority of his life without going back to the bottle and he said    "Eventually  I stopped counting the days and started to make each and every day count "   Live for today  my man  You got this  Panic attacks are a possible side effect with antidepressants and with Kratom  however no widespread side effect   I never had anxiety during my 6 Kratom years   There are opiods which have also a similar effect like antidepressants  This maybe could be the case with Kratom   Thanks for commenting and you keep up the good work as well  I was in that same cycle more evenings than not as well  I agree  I do not miss that battle  Could you describe your self loathing  11 years of purgatory  That sounds miserable  This happened to me a few days ago  I woke up completely panicked and practically shaking  I calmed down when I realized it was only a dream  Thank goodness  My brain working like that in my sleep is just one more reason that I know it's an addiction   5 days for a nonregular i would risk the results over being caught with fake urine I don't post much I'm more of a lurker   But I watched this sub for 2 years before I quit   January 16 I'll have a year without a single drag  u can do it  Cut down your sub dosage  You'd be surprised how easy it is to go from 10 to 8 to 6 to 4 to 2 3  It's only when you get down to 2mg or so that it becomes really tough   I jumped around  25mg per day and wished I jumped lower  The wds were pretty bad and i took kratom for a month or so to sleep and settle my mind   What is making you want to get off subs so quickly  It seems like theyve been pretty good to you   use them the way they were intended and make a push to taper down aggressively That's been recommended to me a few times now  Cued it up on Amazon  Thanks   Last time I quit  I spent some extra money on fancy treats  tea  and natural extra ginger gingerale  The sugar can help with the alcohol cravings  and you still get to look forward to a treat   At 7 months no needle  With the help of Xanax and weed  went full crazy getting off the Xanax tho   Went to the physch ward in the hospital twice in a span of like a week   wish you luck dude gotta remember how sick you feel and never ever forget  But to add to this  He was a pretty bomb ass doctor  I told him I basically drink fairly socially  albeit that's a 12 pack  most of the time but with holiday stress and current financials I hit it pretty hard before I seized in a gas station  pint of Burnetts in hand  And I'm gracious he prescribed me some potassium tablets and what      10 times 25mg after he ordered the mg of Ativan into my IV  Stern but caring   sign me up please Go into more detail about these breast bruises     In fact  post pics  I'm not a doctor but I did drink at a Holiday Inn Express last night  We got this  Oxycodone is not a supplement   Mine too     blushes  I once had a doctor tell me if I was really drinking a fifth a day  I should be dead    K apparently I'm Princess Jess  back from the dead    Most people use "rock bottom" in the context of the moment a bad thing that they were doing due to their addiction made them realize that this was unmanageable   Man I just said screw it and started contacting everyone I knew in my industry and within a few weeks I had three different

SUBSTITUTE  That's exactly what you're doing with the seeds  When you substitute it makes your brain think that you are missing out on something and that just keeps the addiction alive  You aren't missing out on anything  You are breaking free and being a healthy and happier person  But you NEED to read the book again very carefully for this to work  Good luck  Yeah  I've been looking at

when I didn't feel like having sex with my SO at all  The attraction always returned though  stronger than before  after those periods and after a few weeks and months those periods became less and

 I was completely out of it for four days  but fortunately on vacation   Snus is what I went to after 20 years of Skoal  It's much more healthy  but still tobacco and still addictive   Back to work tomorrow  Maybe some different issues  I always crammed those pouches in like crazy at the office     Oh  I really commend you for this  It seems like drinking and skiing  snowboarding is ingrained in the culture there     I ski and work at the ski mountain every weekend  I do independent work and the station where I set up my business is right in front of the bar  It seems like EVERYONE is always drinking  Last season after work I would always go to the bar after I was done with my shift  This past week was the first time working there this season I was super nervous about it  but I actually worked far better and made much more money there then I ever had because I wasn't hungover or waiting to get drunk  Congratulations though   Thanks for sharing  OP  I am no proponent of the  r pornfree perspective  though I'm convinced it will benefit you to do this regardless    Just a clarification here  The fapstronauts  who I am more aligned to  do not shame masturbation  We objectively see the cycle of PMO as intrinsically linked  and want to remove this cycle from our lives  A life without masturbation has no empirically supported problems  and frees up orgasm to be experienced with a partner in a loving relationship  In short  P and M generate sensations that are taken out of their intended context    Removing P is a powerful step in making yourself free of any addictions or crutches you might have  and I hope you succeed in it  Just keep in mind that PMO is a cycle  and removing one element of the cycle does not undo all the damage of the cycle   Great work  Fresh new

actively improve other facets of my life in these 30 days    Achieving the goal that's important to me is a good way to put it  Not smoking weed isn't as important to me as being a resilient  productive person  It is merely circumstance that I cannot be the latter without the former  This differs for everybody  and it took me a long time to admit that I simply cannot thrive with a dependence on pot    So  I'm not looking to merely quit  but establish better habits in weed's place  The more I put the task of quitting on a pedestal  the harder I find it to quit  Making it a byproduct of my 'new' life seems better to me somehow    Weed dependence  and addiction in general  is usually a symptom of underlying issues  Weed withdrawal is so insidiously subtle  I'll just treat it for what it is   one piece of the puzzle that's easily fixed   I'm not trying to suggest this is the best approach or that everyone should do it  If somebody pulled off this method I'd think they're a strong willed person albeit a bit foolish  I want to be a strong willed person and I'm a proven fool at this point so  fuck it   bring the pain  It can't be worse than the dull  soul

then I buy random items that add up to the total of the gift card  Afterwards  I go to a different Walmart  there's 3 in my area  and return it with the receipt    I've only ran it that way a handful of times  because I'm worried about the extra strings it leaves    Side note a good way to do it is search parking lots for receipts and return items of that  My friend once returned a ceiling fan without even leaving the store hah   I've had some mixed experiences going to AA  I live in a real small town and there's two groups within half an hour to me  The first one I went to was my first time going to AA ever  I gained a lot of wisdom and support there  but after going every day for about a month  I saw that many of the members were telling the story of their worst moments to themselves and the group over and over in order to keep themselves sober  I'm glad that that works for them  but I want to move past the things I've done while drinking  not relive them endlessly    I also had a few people tell me that if I wasn't coming to meetings every day  I was already slipping and alcohol already was starting to regain its hold on me  That was frustrating to hear  because I at that point I was going to ever meeting in town that I wasn't working during  and being able to hold a steady job was damn sure something I had regained with sobriety    The 2nd group has been far less negative  People discuss the good things they've gained and the bad things they've shed  One woman there said something that really stuck with me  concerning the culty vibe that some groups can give off  The gist of it was that some people use a dependence on AA to replace their dependence on alcohol  rather than using AA to create a dependence free lifestyle    I would suggest trying out several different groups if that's possible  Even if you don't end up liking the meetings themselves  you could meet people that you mesh with better  and form an informal group that way   Praying you are the Angel that brings him hope and healing    What a wonderful thing    In a general sense  it has to do with never feeling good enough due to laziness or some other character defect that I'm sure I have  I don't really like myself very much  I see mainly my poor qualities  short temper  etc    I don't like looking in the mirror  I pretty much see myself as a bad person who has some people fooled into thinking that I'm nice  etc  I am amazed that my partner thinks I'm worthwhile  how does my partner not see the goblin that I am     I am certain that one day  everyone will turn to me with this knowing look on their faces  thinking  "Yes  CholeraCola is a fraud  And bad  And stupid  And lazy " I am afraid my worst thoughts about myself will be confirmed    At first  way back when   drinking helped to quell those thoughts  It gave me confidence and a feeling of "peace" that sometimes comes with inebriation  Later  it just allowed me to check out  to put my stress on hold  But at the end  drinking just amped up all that negative talk  When I couldn't control it as I intended  i e   stick to a plan of moderation   I really beat myself up  "Not only are you lazy  CholeraCola  you're ungrateful for your life and you are wasting it  And you're gross  Why can't you do what you say you're going to do  Loser  Pathetic "   Essentially  I think I used alcohol as a poor end run around dealing with my own negative self image    I used to think that the whole "love yourself to heal the world" idea was a bunch of hooey cooked up by hippies  using that term broadly  to justify a self indulgent lifestyle  I now understand that it's true  being compassionate toward oneself  compassion   love  is essential in terms of being compassionate toward everyone else    and outward facing compassion makes the world a better place    I'm working on ridding myself of all toxins  Alcohol is one  but so is self loathing  I've found meditation to be very helpful in terms of dealing with the latter  compassion based meditation in particular   and I know that if I keep on working at it  these feelings will go away  They're already starting to  and I'm seeing the world with new eyes  I much prefer this view to the previous one   Don't know if that was the info you were looking for  I hope it was a least minimally helpful   I've never really written that out before   You're not alone and I am totally in awe of your 5 years  I'm sorry you're feeling crappy today  but you are doing amazing  Really is  I was so out of it and the hospital can't give out names  I was going to send him at the very least a happy new year card or at the most a gift card for where I see his ambulance company parked around lunch hours  Dude wasn't even judgemental in the slightest   Fucking bitters   Oh I've done more than my share of them  I kept it a secret for about a year  then told my girlfriend and a few of my closest friends  This was all fine and goid because I quit and let them all know that I was done with it  Well  that quit didn't stick and I used again for a few months and had to tell them    again  This time they were understandably disappointed and my girlfriend was fucking livid  I quit again  fast forward another two months and I had been using behind everyone's back  My behavior had become erratic  at best and awful at worst  They thought I was sober but that I was just a giant asshole This time  I let everyone in my life in on it  I'm fucking done and I want all of them to watch me like a hawk in order to make me hold myself accountable  I told them what to watch for as far as signs of relapse go and indicators that I had been using again  You don't have to tell anybody  but I found it was way too easy to start back up if noone knew what I was doing  anyway    For a while I felt guilty for my anger  I'm allowed to be angry  I've realized I'm allowed to hate the lies   I'm allowed to be angry   looks at dick    ugh Hey there  you're doing great  I totally had the same lack of motivation mind fuck that you're describing when I quit  What helped me the most in the first few days was to tell myself I'll have one in 30 minutes if I still want one  So I still felt that "when I'm done" motivation but I'd either be over the craving by then or up the time "okay  I did 30  I can do 15 more" then in the second week I replaced that with thinking "oh yeah  I'm a non smoker" for some reason saying that to myself really helped   I probably got the ghono ca ca ca cus    I can totally relate with those triggers  Sucks that your friends don't seem to be supportive  Just remember that as will be evidenced by the comments you will receive on your post  there is an army of SD redditors who understand your struggles and have your back  Not drinking

choice by leaving" or "this is not what I want   you're giving up on us  I would never do this " But I must stand strong for myself  He's an alcoholic   he will deny  deny  deny his faults and mistakes at anyone's expense   Ah I fondly remember my first buttplug experience   Quite fabulous but I'm happy we kept it in the bedroom   I could see my last lover making me do something like that   He was very 50 shades and loved to control me   However he was also extremely intense and would never go more than a couple hours without texting me or calling as he needed to know what I was doing at all times  The anger isn't from the "perceived flirtations" alone  The anger and rage goes way  way back  Not drinking is only a beginning  Recovery is a process  Educate yourself about the AA Program

we're usually only assholes to dipshits that practically beg for it   Or when we get completely wasted  "perfect and enlarge our spiritual life through work  and self sacrifice for others " Pg  14   Calms your stomach  dontcha know   I'm partial to grapefruit and rhubarb   Made some kickass fenugreek bitters myself an age ago  but I lost my notes     I do exactly the same thing  Right down to putting it on my keychain  Great minds     I also got link from the app a d will be on here for next few weeks at least   I invested a lot to arrive at not needing something to feel normal  I feel

from Hope  and work in the industry  recovery   so I feel a bit qualified to answer these    For feeling wierd about coming in detoxed  don't  Its totally normal and happens a lot  I had a friend come in 90 days clean  She held the advantage  because she was clear headed enough to get everything possible out of the program   This was the most clean time  but I see a LOT of people come thru already detoxed  The group isnt a bunch of street junkies or things like that  Hell  some of them come thru are marijuana addicts  You wont be out of place  Quite the opposite    Anyway  I sent you a PM  I'm there once or twice a week so I'll be able to say hi  dont really know  I get drunk daily and dont really count  Have not had an alcohol free day in quite a while Saving that one   stop making excuses and start embracing solutions  Yet another good mantra for me from the good folks on SD  Thank you     Look  I'm going to be upfront with you and it will hurt  When I got sober I changed all my drinking buddies names to "Do not answer" in my phone  I really thought that they'd blow up my phone hard and trigger me  But newsflash  I never received one text or call from a "Do Not Answer" number  You know why  They weren't real friends    I literally left in the middle of the night from their home while they were asleep and they never even checked on me  I was arrested on my way home and they never knew  They didn't give a shit about me  And in time I came to realize that I didn't really care about them beyond the egotistically they were "cool" and made me feel "cool"    Luckily  today I have real friends and that's really cool  They call me because I just popped in their mind or they text me just to tell me they love me  They have me call them when I get home    BUT BUT BUT BUT BUT BUT there is a silver lining  I made friends with really great people who stuck by my side and support my sobriety and are normies  Sobriety weeds out the fake for sure  I take shits bigger than you        Not what I was thinking   The Buddha once said  "when the student is ready  the teacher will appear " Glad that you have found each other and wishing you the best in your recovery  I will not drink with you tonight  I don't have the eye burn but the feel like shit is a common symptom of withdrawal  It should go away in few days  In the long run  it's better to feel like shit for a few days than suffer the longer term feel like shit from the life threatening illness to come   Oh  I know  My friends know it  I gave them a bit Kratom some years ago  they tested it   ditn't like it  and gave it back to me  But they still don't know the most important part of the story  that it became a problem for me  and that i am 5 months sober now    OMG I get u totally  You r exactly where I am at  Can we b sober sisters please  I need the support  I'm on day two as well  Just about went to the store  Le sigh  I have read Allen Carrs book way back when I tried to quit about eight years ago and I just got the kindle version to read again  I lent out my original copy  I'll admit I got the fucking book so I could smoke  Grrr  We can do it though   Probably the ld50  Lethal dose for 50  of people   Still going  this is going to be the breakthrough year  Thanks for the post  Ahem     I'll be the judge of that    All my nightmares were related to PTSD trauma  so I was just diagnosed with simple PTSD  Can I have those disorders and PTSD  Are they different   Good questions   I'm not a doctor  and I haven't the foggiest idea   Ask a GP or psychiatrist or psychologist  "The high is soooo fleeting" definitely resonates with me  On my peak smoking days I started to look at the clock when I smoked to see how long it would take for me to desire another sesh    and it ended up being 20 fucking minutes sometimes  Granted it felt like a much longer time  which is why I'm glad I did some investigative work  But 20 minutes   That means I had been blazing 3 times an hour sometimes  all day long  Fucking waste of time and money just to feel stupid  Whew  Thanks for listening  I needed to rant that out apparently  And the self defeating voice is another mystery of weed that I don't understand my attraction to  I hate that voice Thank you so much    So many to choose from    Consistent   I can be really boom and bust prone when it comes to doing work  I feel like Ive lacked the resilience to struggle  So a consistent schedule based life is warranted to avoid waffling due to the temptations of running from work  Thank you so much  He doesnt use this sub and I stumbled upon it today  Its so refreshing to see everyones outlook here on porn  Its so confusing for him  as his friends all use it constantly  hes constantly reminded every where that men use it  and that its a thing that women just need to accept and get over     I constantly initiate and never knew about all of these side effects since reading the posts from today  so I am feeling a bit better and hoping that its just this type of "withdrawal" and not some other issue that I am unaware of   I was still watching a lot of videos  until my friend told me he'd try nofap  So we bet 100   Here we go  Id give it more than two days  Thank you  I need the warmth here in OfuckingHio    It was only  5 back home   And here  you can't go to another Walmart  I tried that    They said the upc didn't match the store  Had to go back to the one I took it from   Lol   Anyone can get it  I did it one day at a time  I went to AA meetings  read the Big Book  got a sponsor  worked the steps  and became open and willing  except for right now when I'm being a little bratty   3 days in  looking forward to feeling great  Thank you for caring    Okay   Nice work   Two great milestones in your first ten days    You're no lunatic  If you are already 16 days into quitting then you are 'over the hump' and you probably have a lot more energy  Use that energy to take a walk  ride a bike  clean the house  etc  Congratulations on 16 days  btw    Thank you  I will start tonight  It's just emotions  I know they will pass but just suck in the mean time  Sign me up  I did December and I actually made it  I'm

back when  glad I didn't  sounds pretty wild  glad you're alright   This question made me remember why I'm constantly gnawing on a piece of gum as soon as I start the car  171 days quit today  my

promise I won't stand by in the rafters saying " He's losing his mind  And I'm reaping all the benefits "  I've contemplated on using medication for my anxiety and light depression  I'm going to try cognitive behavioral therapy first but if something doesn't give  I'd like to feel better  I thought a year would give me all the answers I needed  Now at a year I see the answers are there  but I need to keep working for them  I do feel peaceful which is enough for now  Thank you for your words   Cripes  I'm sorry to hear that your relationship broke up   That is a tough blow to take right now and I hope you can weather the storm without picking up   I know it is hard and I also know that you are badass enough to pull this off and come out the other side with a clear mind and a smile on Your face     Time to turn a lemon into a lemonade        I don't know about you but to me having a partner is a source of support but also a lot of frustration and just putting up with their stuff   You won't have to deal with that anymore   The peace that will eventually settle in that void if you allow it  can relax your mind and be quite liberating     The anxiety that we experience coming off of weed makes us easy to anger and can put a great strain on a relationship   I can remember going up one side of a fella and down the other for 5 minutes or so just because he spilled my coffee   I apologized like crazy after I calmed down but the anger that rose so swiftly and the verbal tirade that ensued were relationship damaging and a huge eye opener to me   In the early days of recovery  the more solitude I have  the easier it flows   I only have to deal with my stuff        not his too     You ask for a reason not to smoke  so here is one of mine and seeing as you are recently single  it might set well with you too   I might like to get in a relationship in the future  once I am over this addiction and I want to be in a relationship with someone who is clean   The least I can do is bring to the table a person of the same quality     Big Hugs   I hope you are OK   Look after Yourself   Love Yourself Fiercely    Good job  Could be   I was worried about the blindness but my WDs were so fucking bad then   So odd that I drink just as much if not more and I weigh like 30 pounds less from walking all summer thanks to no drivers license and yet I no longer get WDs   Like at all   Not even really a hangover   I drank so much all day Saturday and sunday and didn't stop until 3am this morning   I also drank a liter on Friday night between the hours of 10pm and 4am   Today I'm just fucking fine   Been sober all day   No shakes  sweats  puking  Fear   No spider monkeys   I don't know what changed with me   Maybe because I'm more fit   Taking vitamins and eating healthy when not drinking  Not drinking with you tonight      So I guess that brings me back to my question   Why 30 days   If you really want to bring the pain then why not 360  Or 720  Or the rest of your life   Working the steps in AA involves tools that deal with guilt and shame  A therapist was helpful  too    Someone already mentioned movies  but I'll second that   I actually enjoy going to movies by myself and do it pretty regularly   The nice thing about doing that  besides the big screen and what not  is that you're totally immersed   You can't pause it  answer the phone  etc   So you get that two hours totally to yourself   And since drinking isn't even possible  at most theaters  anyway  I don't think of it   I don't associate movie going with drinking at all   This pull is for Jeff  I always appreciate the people who are willing to accommodate the imperative needs of our lifestyle when they really don't have to  Gotta admit I almost teared up a little reading this  I think getting through all of this in early recover  oy vay the Caribbean    would be a huge test  Congrats on your resolve and success   That my husband and sexually assaulted me and that I had PTSD and postpartum depression  oh man  i dont have the exact same scenario  but i have definitely have paused many times and wondered  What the fuck am I doing       Scary   Do you have a plan to quit    "The Slight Edge" by Jeff Olson   Smoking has seriously given me major ADD is reading books became close to impossible for me   This book managed to captivate me and keep me involved  It's slowly changing my life  It is definitely appropriate to ask your friend to go to a meeting with you    As for telling others  everyone is different but I told family and a select group of close friends  It was a relief to not feel like I was hiding something anymore  At the time I was living on the west coast while everyone else was back east so people didn't have a sense of just how bad it had gotten   This is normal in early sobriety  After abusing my body for years  it took time to find equilibrium   I still promise myself whiskey when I'm 90  Today I remain sober  Congrats on 4 years    You're not alone  Feel free to vent here  We're listening   I was in my own bratty mood this morning  Luckily  a silly voicemail from a friend pulled me out of it  I am whining about having to return to work  Which is ridiculous  I should be happy to have a job   You have a rash  This rash goes away when you itch it  but only for a slight moment  Then when you stop itching it  it comes back  but even stronger than the last time  How awful this is  however could you get rid of this rash    The rash will go away in time  but only if you dont itch it   Don't itch the rash baconlettuce1tomato  You will be relieved for a moment  only to realize the rash is still there when you stop itching it    Allow yourself to feel the pain  the longing for weed  Allow it to come up  stay  and then leave on its own time  Because all sensations are temporary  An urge could stay for say only 5 minutes  but only if you allow it do its thing    When you get involved with the urge  like start freaking out about how you're going suppress  or if you're going to give in  then the urge stays for a lot longer because you're feeding the energy    Dont feed the energy of the urge  Let it come  let it be  let it go   That's why I'm here  Won't be drinking with you today  Welcome to  r RedditorsInRecovery  and thanks for sharing   Your worries are normal  but still   A   What  u augm said   B   I think rehab will be helpful for you   Have you ever been inside any rehab and met some of the clients  or gone to any kind of addiction support group meeting   If so  which  I too drove over the limit many times  I felt invincible and never had an accident in that condition  However  I often worried that if I were involved in an accident  even if it wasn't my fault  I would still get a DUI  Those days are over   Happy 15th and Happy New Year  I want to be like you    I also feel like I drank really hard and had a lot of serious consequences and a lot of these women seem like they had one too many glasses of wine at dinner and I can't relate  Go to AA or NA   Introduce yourself to some people who've been to jails or rehabs before    Listen to their shares   Also  look at their physical appearance   If they have clearly visible face tattoos  for example  they've probably hit a fairly low rock bottom    Decide whether or not they might make good sponsor material   Even if not  you can still ask  them  who  their  sponsor is     I've never been married and have no children  and I do feel like this sets me apart from other women  Have you ever considered asking a gay man to be your sponsor   Many of them have never been married  and many have no children   Phone your local AA or NA intergroup and ask if there's an especially LGBTQ friendly meeting in your city or state   In my city  such meeting usually happen in the gay village community center   Alternatively  have you ever considered asking a woman much younger than you  never married  with no kids  to be your sponsor   Note   I've never tried any of the ideas I've suggested  so I have no clue whether or not they'll work   Dear all   What do you think  Firstly it is not supposed to be cathartic   No where is it stated that that is an expectation or result of the 4th step   you should feel pretty fucked up if you were honest   That is the good part   That means you were probably honest and the rest of the steps work if you are honest   For many people their bottom comes with being sober and working through the steps   What we feel is wrong in sobriety is usually right   As we don't like feeling and our brains and bodies want the old solution which is drugs and alcohol   Hang in there   The purpose of the whole process is to move us out of the way so we can make room for a psychic change   Then take someone else through the process and continue changing as a result   Hang in there it gets better   This is why there is the saying "pain is the touchstone of change " Once I stopped alcohol  the underlying issues that began my alcohol ingestion started to surface  Insomnia  Anxiety  Just being uncomfortable with myself altogether   With the help of a physician  I was put on non addictive medication to help me sleep  a  huge  relief  I'd been a life long insomniac  and for me  an antidepressant that's targeted toward relieving anxiety  Those two things helped me focus on what I needed to do with myself to stay well    Counseling with a therapist who knows my complete  unadorned history  and who is also in recovery  made a big difference as well in changing my perspective on the world    It was a process  And it's still on going  Eleven days is just enough to allow your brain to clear up a bit    With help from others  it will get better   I couldn't hang on as long as I have  I don't think  without the help of some trusted professionals  Doing it on my own had failed far too many times for me to believe I could do it myself  And today  I don't feel like I'm hanging on  I'm making progress   Best to you    Cold showers I never understand that shit   I want to be the  least  CA possible    Who wants this    thank you   I got that dreaded panicked feeling in the pit of my stomach   I've been in a very similar situation before and it was a wake up call   I would never steal from a friend but for some crazy reason thought that alcohol was different   Jess  I'm so jealous  I can barely drink anything without feeling like shit  And I'm even eating normally   I gotta echo what you said about using it as an acceptable form of coping with emotional stress  There are a lot of ways that smoking gets cooked into your mind and your habits  I always liked to celebrate finishing a task by lighting up   but using it as a way to calm down when you're angry was huge for me  Not even one puff    Glad you are back  I'll join you tonight    in not smoking  Happy 2017  Let's make this a great year  when i first started this journey  i was a bit frantic  i shared a list of things I'd like to accomplish with my therapist  it had like  no joke  over 30 items on it  and they were not small accomplishments either   not surprisingly i was extremely stressed out   a lot of therapy later I realized that i didn't like myself very much and was using these accomplishments and perceived gold stars to make up for that  and a drinking problem    What if at the end of 90 days you  only  had another 90 days sober  a very strong meditation practice of 20 minutes a day  and had learned to cook a few healthy meals which you eat regularly   still sounds like a major win to me   Sign me up  I hear you  I can usually tell when my boss has been in the hallway of my office for a while after he's left because the smoke smell is following him  It's a trip when you realize that you smelled like that to  Day 2 for me as well and I'm really miserable  I tried to cook dinner and eat just a little bit ago  but I couldn't bring myself to actually eat the food  I didn't sleep last night either  I just want to smoke again but I can't  I broke down and got a bottle of wine to try to make me sleep tonight  check out r leaves I know  One thing that helped me was to start exercising during my taper   I had a few weeks to build strength and endurance before going off kratom completely    I live in Canada    little to cold for outdoor activities  But I will try the hand to mouth suggestion  Thanks   I discovered those things about myself as well after doing my fourth step  I was pretty disgusted with myself and embarrassed  So many horrible feelings   BUT  After a couple of days  and after talking to my sponsor  I understood that because I was the one who had seriously wrecked  everything   no one else did  that I was the one who could make changes to myself and make things better   That  was where the empowerment came in for me  I had the power to change  I just never realized it    I was amazed    You're not stuck  This knowledge about yourself can set you free  Having a solid gym buddy helped me a lot  Eventually  I got into group cycling  so from March to November there is a group ride almost every day of the week  I would throw my gear in the car in the morning  by the end of the day  heck  I did all that work   why waste it   I hope you find the thing that works for you and gives you that drive   While you are searching  I won't drink with you today  It's the AA of the internet for me without the traveling to a location   Great   Same boat  always happens around vacation time  My plan is to schedule something every hour of the day so that there's no more free time during which I can play games  You should check out the movie trainspotting  Great movie about addiction   That's a good point   If nobody knows what's going on and I don't tell anyone when I've quit  there won't be that additional pressure to never look back  It's just so easy to hide it    And my BF is SMART  But I've got an emergency dose hidden in a tampon   some in an empty compact   always put my morning dose in my hoodie zip pocket and grab that   go to the bathroom first thing in the am   I hate feeling like a fraud and a liar  On the other hand  it's pushing me forward in my taper  cuz I wanna be able to be honest   My pupils don't change   it's easy to hide it physically  But I'm terrified I will be discovered before I'm done tapering  Terrified   really I have zero idea what to do    It's so weird that I denied the existence of this problem to myself for so long  I looked online and read all the blurbs that 'Kratom is no more habit forming than caffeine ' And I stopped there because that's what I WANTED to believe  Jesus  at least I'm not lying to myself anymore   It's the weirdest fucking thing   I swear I wasn't drinking as much last spring as I am now but I would puke blood and be a mess for days before I would pull out of them  I'm really in to the mocktails  They are delicious and also give me more of a feeling of belonging when I'm having happy hour with clients or dinner with friends  There's only so much soda water a person can drink  Congrats on your day one   Stay strong  Habits are hard to replace but if you could think of something else to reward yourself with maybe you could start a new habit  It wasn't my shining moment that's for damn sure  "We must all suffer from one of two pains  the pain of discipline or the pain of regret  The difference is discipline weighs ounces while regret weighs tons    Jim Rohn All good man  relapses happen  I'm the king of relapses  I've probably relapsed like 100  times over the past two years haha  What you learned from this is that you need a better reward system in place  One that you CAN control  Do something you're proud of  Maybe watch a good movie go out for drinks buy something small that you want eat some good food  Obviously if you also have problems moderating with any of those things I wouldn't use them as rewards but you get the idea    I would highly suggest writing down exactly how you feel  all of your emotions about the relapse in a tangible way  notepad journal sloppy napkin  and re read what you wrote any time you want to relapse  I started journaling and any time I think about playing I pop open one of my many pages where I've relapsed and read it  then I remember "Oh yeah  fuck League of Legends " Any addict will tell you relapses happen  don't think of it as starting over  but as continuing your journey  Best of luck  I can understand the shame part because I once felt the exact same way  What got me through the shame was realizing that I was not unique  and I was not weak because I was suffering  that a lot of other people were suffering too and some of them had figured out how to get better  When I discovered a community of people like me  suddenly I stopped feeling so ashamed about the fact that I have alcoholism   Wow  So much love to you  I hope you can heal from that   Now I've got Billy Joel stuck in my head  god damn it  Lmao   Good luck though  I'm working on losing weight myself  Don't lose that drive  It's gonna be worth the effort  Awesome ive been using gum maybe 2 to 3 pieces a day  The nightmares are pretty constant though but im sure it will pass  Thanks for the advice bro ill try the toothbrush thing and see how it helps  Its not incredibly hard so far not sure why this time is easier than other failed attempts lol I pulled out my old snowboard for the first time in like 6 7 years  It was my favorite sport in my teenage years and my early twenties  I stopped going because of the hangovers and because I got fat    But anyway  I went to a small mountain 3 days ago and I wasn't that bad  the only thing is that I discovered old unused small muscles in my body the next day  lol And oh boy I missed the views  The honesty is so important  It has been my saving grace  I lied to everyone   especially myself about my disease  Be truthful has only brought me positivity   even when it's ugly and it hurts  Thank you for your candor  You're off to a great beginning  This thread is making me nervous       I need to be  utterly  clean at the turn of the month  Ideally a week before  Laid down my drugs a week ago  coke  weed   Staying clear of them for the foreseeable future   Well capable of booze detox  but not an expert on drugs   My favorite number  Congrats   I am on day 18  and I gotta say    I think I am finally free  I live in the weed capital of the world  with a dispensary on every corner  I am not tempted though  I am past the worst of the withdrawals  and now I am feeling so much better  I won't lie  the first week sucked BAD  I kept coming to this group whenever I was feeling like I couldn't made it  and just read post after post until the cravings eased up  Eventually I got to a point where I could post my own story  That helped too  But what helped me the most is encouraging people that are just starting the journey  Thanks for sharing your story too  You don't know who it might help  but believe me someone is going to be inspired by you  Stay strong  Fuck I'm late here  Hope you're doing better  dude  I Also wanted to tell you I had an uncle that died from internal bleeding  He was an alcoholic  He was also a great man  I miss him  You're awesome  Congratulations  Tantrums are my favorite     Yeah  the shitty part about being an alcoholic is that you are always an alcoholic  Running or biking hard always help me  as do melatonin and breathing exercises  and an earlier poster was right   I've never regretted not drinking  yeah maybe  i have used fake urine a half dozen times and its never been a problem for me  Just make sure it is the right temp and make sure it isnt in your pockets  Tuck it in a waistband or sock cause they might make you empty your pockets  Thoughts and love to your friend  You can do this friend      Honesty this is probably the route I'll take  Every other day kind of doseage Agreed  I was lucky enough to see them in October and it was one of my top three most favorite nights on 2016   Thanks  everyone  You all have been incredibly helpful  I'm just gonna take it one day at a time and know that it'll all be much better after a week  I'm actually doing way better    I moved to a city where I'm way happier and have friends  and can feel comfortable having far more moderate  if not ideal  eating habits  And can be drunk every day  D my friend who cut me off because of my eating hasn't come around yet  but I'm over it    I'm so sorry about your uncle  Mine has stabilized  although I think the fallout related to his lifestyle choices will last a long time  We have a fair few alcoholics in the family  and while I obviously can't judge  I still hope none of us face serious consequences from it   thanks for sharing   I relapsed as well  sober 5 months now  with a lot of the same thoughts  behaviors and now      wood paneling  I've always hated wood paneling but that is the most beautiful wood paneling I've ever seen  Man I bookmarked this  Thanks for sharing  I had a very similar experience that was at first diagnosed as a heart attack  I spent four days in the hospital and it hurt like hell  Your post brought it back in a useful way   I needed the reminder  Well  to be honest  it's my winter break from school and this has probably been the most laziest time ever  So  literally no exercise other than walking 5 mins to the bus stop  Thanks for the advice  Yeah  I recognize that I seriously have an issue if even after 38 I said fuck it  and continued to smoke when I was probably a lot closer to testing negative    It's not the end of the world  but it will be crushing and induce a really bad depression in me if I do  It's my dream career  the fact that I could go on a meth coke binge and be fine in 3 days and get the job kills me  but merp  Being fucked over here for weed even though I've stopped for a while  Life i guess Haha  yes  It's a shame that it's not okay for adults to just have a bit of a cathartic meltdown  I used to get annoyed with kids who had meltdowns at  say  the grocery store  Now  I'm just jealous  lol   Have you tried a sober living facility  You can keep working  but they keep you accountable and you get the brotherhood of people around you who also want to get better   Don't fuck with mah brain bro  This is great and reminds me of my first year  I still struggle terribly with loneliness but I've learned to manage cravings and my associated will power  I'm really happy for you  keep at it champ  You can do this  I'm on day 4 and although I still get cravings they are getting lighter and further apart  The Smoke free app is helping me a lot and this forum too  We can both succeed    I'm with you  My stomach has felt rotten and I've had an incredibly persistent headache  I know it gets better  this is not my first rodeo  but hopefully it will be my last   I'm also fatigued  I just keep telling myself that I will feel better and the cravings will subside  Unfortunately  that's when the real work will begin  again    Good luck   So good you can recognize this  I did things I'm so ashamed of when I was drinking  You have the opportunity now to change what scares you most NOW while you're still young  Don't wake up like many of us decades later   stick with it   There's also the option of over hydration to void the results and give more time for it to leave his system Some days  knowing I don't have anymore bottles hidden or to get rid of is the best gift of sobriety   It freed me from soooo much anxiety and fear    I didn't realize how much energy it was zapping from my life   Can definitely relate  Hope you find some peace as well    Feel free to reach out for support    I don't think 2 5mg of Oxy is going to have any effect at all on your detox   Perhaps one extra day of discomfort   At worst   Just get back to your clean life ASAP   The thing that worries me is  'was feeling depressed and took half'   Remember the detox depression is temporary  as painful as it may be  and trying to medicate with opiods is a trap that leads you further down the hole     You're good  just get back on the train fam  Cinnamon sticks for me  But anything that works is good    We can do this    4 days for me   Awww this is beautiful  I agree with so much of it  Thank you for the shout out  Oh and also I changed my phone number so you should message me yours again so I can put it in my phone   The other thing to remember is that since you resigned  if a future employer calls for a background check  likely HR will simply just say that you quit  Now you probably won't want to put down your direct manager as a personal reference   But if FutureJob calls the company just to verify you resume you should be in the clear  great way to be motivated  you've got this  Love that one    I hate to say it but I think you're right about your uncle  I wish the best for both of you  I'll see you around  take care  I'm honestly not stressed  I'm okay in my life  I just need to fill this time with productive pursuits I find meaningful  If after 90 days all I can say is I'm sober  I will be thoroughly disappointed  I wouldn't accept that when I was using  I won't accept it now   Thanks man    you're good people It's more than zero  and each day is a satisfying chunk of the total compared to 360 or 720  The end of 30 days might be a chance to relapse but so is everyday in your model  It's all arbitrary  and the indefinite model has not worked for me     Edit  Also  I want to be someone who can hold out for more than 'just today'  360 days of sheer will is preposterous  30 is not   Thank you Probably not   2 5 is a very small amount   I was clean for a little over 2 weeks and took a bunch of 10s over two days   It did not affect my WDs at all   It just picked up where I left off when I ran out   Just don't get caught taking them every day for a long period of time or taking very large amounts      The day is done It's time to find their shelter Hidden in the dunes And fall asleep the Music of the moon You and me Lesbian seagull Those are the words that are posted along side the driveway leading to Sundown M Ranch where I did my inpatient rehab  That place changed my life  I didn't drink that day  I'm not drinking today   You are awesome  You are strong  The first days are fucking hard  no doubt  but those hard days are temporary  I am on day 18  and I feel so much better now  I know that you can push through the hard times  You did a great and brave thing coming to this group asking for encouragement  We are there for you  I am sending you good vibes  Stay strong  We believe in you   Ohio as well  Thanks for the shares  Positive mojo for you   On the meditation pillow in stillness or on the yoga mat breathing in motion  Great advice   That's awesome  Congratulations on your success  Girlfriend  I'm so happy you're ok  It's got to be difficult having your son limit your interactions with the grand baby  I have learned on my end earning trust takes time  My relationships have repaired vastly and I feel like I'm earning trust back slowly  My fear is that my oldest daughter saw "drunk mom" for so many years that her image of me will always be tainted  I didn't get sober until she was 21 and already moved out of the house  I can only try and be there NOW as sober mom and hope she forgives me for all the times I woke up hung over  puking and cranky  My younger children hopefully will never have to experience this  Great job on 100 days  One day at a time we will get there wherever there is   Sunflower seeds absolutely  If the oral fixation is an issue for you seeds are perfect  You rewarded yourself by loving yourself  Rewards yourself by posting about how strong you were  Still clean for more than a  week   Hat tip  sir  Congrats on a year  Just want to echo many of the good suggestions others have made  the only way to make your life better is to stay sober   It's the only thing that helped me get through a somewhat similar transition   I quit drinking several months before I was fired from my Fortune 500 job of over a decade   My story was that I quit due to lack of job satisfaction and advancement opportunity in my company   I had been looking for a lateral move within the company for several months before getting fired   Getting fired was the best thing that has happened to me in recent memory  besides quitting drinking    Staying sober during my job search helped me get a job with a better salary and much higher job satisfaction  working with people whom I really enjoy working with  which was not the case at my previous place of employment    Do whatever it takes to stay sober   Shore up the support you need   AA  individual therapy  and reading sobriety books  I highly recommend Allen Carr's "The Easy Way To Stop Drinking"   and working on meditation have all been invaluable and essential steps for me   The early months were the most difficult and seem to be for everyone   Get through it by getting the support and doing the work   Focusing on that next job and doing really well on your interviews  company research and interview prep  can be welcome distractions   And here is a key bit of advice  when you do get that next job  make darn sure you tell everyone who invites you out for a drink  because they will   "I do not drink at all  period  end of story"   I pretty much had to say that on day one   Very glad I did   And FWIW  I'm kicking ass at this new gig and loving it   You can do it if you put your mind to it and do the work   We're all rooting for you  Yeah   I've been watching some snowflakes from my comfy bed   way past wd's  almost 30 days clean   I get those thoughts  and think of the famous quote from Alfred Lord Tennyson    'tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all  I drank two bottles of wine a night   Until I just couldn't stand the pain of who I was becoming  I made myself work out early because I knew at night I'd just be too tired  So I woke up 90 min earlier than I usually did so I could work out  It sucked but the alternative was worse  Good luck on your path   You're looking at 4 weeks minimum and probably a lot better at 6 weeks  Time passes  Look forward to the next day and before you know it weeks have passed and you'll be wondering where did it all go    The brightside is  somewhere down the line you'll be able to brush your cravings off easily and by easily I mean going nah and it's gone  I am now able to bring my pint out of a bar to hang out with my friends when they smoke and not want for it  Good luck bro  You can still be in the industry while not consuming    PLenty sommeliers dont drink   The best in the business often dont consume their own products  Absolutely  I check in here daily  There is so much experience and wisdom here  and in person meetings keep me grounded and accountable  Same here  duder    helped an old friend unpack and organize his shit today  I was so grateful that he asked me to help  Ha  I woulda just sat home  smoked cigs and drank all day otherwise  Instead  I got to feel somewhat productive while having a few beers  some kratom and watch him bug out on edibles while he judged me for my drinking  He sent me home with some thc pills and I puked all over my coffee table  work shoes and floor after trying to swallow one with a beer  I have these stories and more  often  He always tells me I should write a silly book about that and my cooking adventures  He kinda shames me and then turns around to tell me he's glad that I'm very self aware and have entertaining stories to boot  I  like you  should share more  I feel like I'm out of practice and have no right to bitch if I'm not contributing myself  Resolutions are silly    This could be a good one  though    outside of work  I'm just sitting on my ass for the most part  Might as well MAKE CA GREAT AGAIN   Bug me to post and I'll bug ya back  It'll be good for us  I have kept it a secret except for the few friends who introduced it to me  That is the main reason I'm quitting  I hate being secretive around my friends and family  Making sure I have enough kratom  carrying around that big bag in my coat pocket  it's embarrassing really  I've become so addicted to it  I was tapering the past couple weeks  now I'm 24 hours into quitting cold turkey  0g a day  and its rough    I feel your pain  But remember  nothing is impossible   We got this    Chewing gum is great  Open the car window  even if it's cold  But an even better method is that you and your brain are committed to changing your life to freedom mode   Fruit juice  and water are both great to have when you get that smoking urge  And also  NOT having a pack in the car  You've got this    Holy crap  I know this is from four months ago but I'm looking through old posts and this is exactly me  Basically at 3 p m  when I'm still at work I start thinking about what I'm going to drink   where I'm going to buy it  how it will taste  if I'll finish the bottle or be "good " But if I can make it to dinner I'll be fine and sober for the night  5 months sober  That's awesome   I'll be there one day    Cheers  Keep it up  Welcome to freedom  Your words are so vivid  I feel your pain  I don't know what makes this better  I don't know what makes this all go away  I wish there was an answer  There's got to be more to life than this though  I'm tired of my illness pulling the strings  I want more  I'm 26 too  I feel like I've lost so much as well  and in order to move on you do have to grieve  I just know I can't keep living like this   Gratitude and hope are so important to recovery  Hang on to those  Yeah  it took me about a year and a half for the physical urge to be mostly be gone  The mental is what I still work on and that is a continual process  Meetings  doing the readings  and having someone that I can call and talk to help with the mental aspect of it in my life  Your welcome  if you have any other questions just ask here  Your question has helped me to stay sober today  thank you for your help   D I started a beginner lifting program recently  It's 3 days a week starting on mondays  I was in a poor mood all day  I didn't want to work out but I knew I would feel better after I did it  And I do  I feel way better  It's a very simple program with an app  strong lifts 5x5  that is just 3 exercises with rest periods in between  No thought required  Another thing that go me to work out is it is one of the only things I'm doing differently than when I was drinking  I know this and more will be required to succeed in sobriety  because I have failed in the past by choosing to do nothing  Given melatonin a try    I am proud of you  my friend  You did something very hard to do  The first days are hard  but everyday it gets better  This group is a wonderful thing  full of people that care about you  You are among your peers here  We all have suffered  but we are all here to better our lives  Keep coming here when you are feeling it hard  Read others stories  Ask questions  You will see that you are not alone  I know you can do this  You are strong  You are brave  You have my respect for starting this journey   "http   www portablepoetry com poems alfredlord tennyson in memoriam ahh     html  took forever to find the whole thing     I've read a lot of his stuff when i was younger     			V I sometimes hold it half a sin 	To put in words the grief I feel  	For words  like Nature  half reveal And half conceal the Soul within   But  for the unquiet heart and brain  	A use in measured language lies  	The sad mechanic exercise  Like dull narcotics  numbing pain   In words  like weeds  I'll wrap me o'er  	Like coarsest clothes against the cold  	But that large grief which these enfold Is given in outline and no more " See this is a great story   We only have ourselves to blame by not sharing the fun dumb crazy ass shit we do   But I did make my first post in r cagonewild today so I got that going for me   I'll start posting my crazy shit again too   This last week has been quite the adventure  I will not drink today It will always  always be your fault  Always     You need to accept this if you are going to be in a relationship with an alcoholic  You're doing great  No help needed  Just remember to stay within the confines of the day  That sitting is probably a good idea  i personally only sit for fifteen a day  twenty five on weekends   but I've been doing it for years now  and I find it really helpful in helping me work with me  I kept popping the 25mg Libriums every 30 min until the fear went away  I think it ended up being 4 5 initially on day 1  For my initial dose  Probably took another 3 4 that night  Then tapered from there  Didn't drink at all  You're gonna need more than 10  Yea that was the main thing  this guy and I have been through a lot over 8 years and i'd never in my wildest dreams steal from him  but this just didn't even register until after i nearly got found out and actually envisioned how he would feel and what that would do in reality  That's when I really realised how under the control of alcohol I actually was  Yep  this  Maybe look at different groups  Awesome  So proud of you  Stay strong  With a user name like acehawk I don't know how you can go wrong  As a person with anxiety I can say mine has been much more manageable sober  Congrats in your decision  Yeah this is a contest I prefer to lose at   I'm currently not but I have high hopes  this is exactly what im going thru  thats the same thing i thought im broke but im sober and still have my health better things will come man  Well the key is two things   1  90  of my work happens online  so as long as I have wifi  I'm able to work  Most of the time when you see me traveling  I'm still working full time while I'm there  It's just that I'm in Thailand instead of Canada  or the U S   2  Prior to 2016  for the previous 2 1 2 years  I didn't have an apartment  so I literally was traveling from place to place at all times  and mostly staying with friends or people I met at different events I went to  So I would go to an entrepreneurship event conference  and people would ask me where I was living  I'd say I was traveling  and they tended to invite me to come hang out and stay with them in their city  so I would  I had nowhere else to go really   and then onto the next spot  So this saved me a ton of money on accommodations  I wasn't paying rent  and I was staying with most people for free   and when I did pay for a place  it was through a hostel  cheap  or airbnb  cheaper than hotel    On top of that  in places like Southeast Asia  it costs like  20 30 day to live there  food  accommodations  etc   so it's actually far cheaper than being in the U S  Travel is not expensive  living in the U S  is expensive  An apartment  car  insurance  etc  etc  that's expensive  Travel can be very cheap if you're smart and resourceful  I've had some periods lasting weeks where I haven't drank  I kinda went back to it over the holidays as my family is all here and they drink so I didn't even try  But they leave on the 5th  so that's going to be day 1    Before the holidays I was on a good exercise regime  i'm in decent shape  so i'll be getting back to that as well  Exercise helps a lot  That explains how everyone seems so fearless on the slopes   Great fear of steep slopes and ski lifts here  Good for you for keeping on with an activity you really enjoy and doing it sober  Must've felt great  Reading and writing  as you've done  on reddit  olganon or any websites that allow it  I was like you in college  but I never thought I had a problem because most of my friends were doing the exact same thing   But that doesn't mean that it's not a serious health risk  as you're wise to realize  If you can break the cycle now  and stop yourself from pissing away the rest of your youth at the bottom of a bottle  and believe me  you'll be old before you know it    you'll be better off than many of us on this sub   I've only been using it for 2 1 2 months  but yeah nobody knows   After having 5 years sobriety I feel too ashamed to tell anyone   The guilty feeling has been hitting me hard lately  hard enough to know that I need to get off this stuff     I don't plan on telling anyone that I'm on it   Luckily we have the wonderful people in this sub to help us feel not so alone in this   I'll be tapering right along with you  so take some solace in that      Thank you for writing this  Congrats on your year and thank you for being a part of the SD community  Sober on  my friend  I think that's how we all feel   thanks Go to an NA Meeting    Say all this shit ALOUD   In PERSON   Own up to YOURSELF   and get Honest   That's the only way you're gonna get through it  for real  is by being real with it   No hiding shit   Tell on yourself  Be held accountable and responsible for yourself   If you want the DIY  get a couple oz's of Kratom   about 5 grams a day   Taper down with that   It'll seriously help the wd's  both physical and mental   Yeah  I've been out of rehab for 7 days   Used opiates since damn   the late 90's    fuck   yeah   i'm 33   shit   more than half my life  FUCK      Yep   I hit the "ENOUGH " stage    doing the clean time now  and NO Alcohol either   it's legit   EDIT    Yeah   Do whatever works for ya     I tapered this summer w  kratom n weed   then caught a charge after getting clean   was setup 6 months ago   had fulltime work   etc   then NOPE  jail  FML    then cheap pills came around  and i ended up in rehab   got "on the radar"   and knocked off the "self medicating" Awesome job   I imagine that's a nightmare scenario  all alone with a fully stocked bar   You did good   Alcohol will hang back and challenge you again some other day   I hope you'll remember your decision today when that happens  Happy Smoke Free New Year   One day at a time       I sent lem a funny pic of my vag with santa style bubbles  Turns out somebody else has his old number  Ha  They called me a disgusting animal  That flick should go on cagonewild    Perhaps they copied that from Bigtobacco  At the beginning they also said that tobacco is not addictive  I'm not living in the US  and for me this is really strange  Nobody says that here   "helps me identify with my youth"    great insight brother  This is going to stick with me for a while  I don't even like the feeling of being stoned anymore  but I love the idea of "getting blazed with my friends" like I started doing when I was 18  Rebellious  exciting  weird and fun  Now it's annoying  boring  energy draining and just plain gross  cleaning my clogged pipe once a week with globs of rez pouring out    thinking about my lungs     and yet I still am drawn to it  I am drawn to my exciting youth  experiencing new things  I'm pretty small so my fitness goals involve putting on muscle  I want to develop upper body strength and be able to do multiple pull ups by the end of this year     Also  to save money I plan on eating at home more often and as a result will probably be eating less sugar this way  Guess that's a good thing too Woke up again this morning so much better off than I would have been hung over    it's an exciting new way to be going about life      That is some sound advice  thank you   I can't imagine  Flower is hard enough    don't give up  It'll be worth it in the long term Yup  I always used it as a way to try and soothe myself whenever my anxiety kicked in     I think it's a little crazy  too  that a lot of these reasons are almost caked into society  like our use of tobacco to "calm down"   Or that cigarette after a meal that everyone swears is amazing   Or even an example where it's absolutely caked in  taking a break at work in many establishments   Or what about the romanticization of the drunk cig   So many excuses just built right into the social fabric of our environments for us to use in a relatable  blame free way   One of the most courageous posts I've read  Mad respect here   Dude  ME TOO  Ahhhh  Where do you live   They played Brothers and Jesse's mic stand was covered in daisies  It absolutely crushed me   Bro this is so me  I started drinking heavily cause of a girl problem and also got a DUI cause I was mad  scared  anxious and the only thing that happened was that I paid a ton of money and have a DUI on my record and at the end she still ditched me and has been a b tch to me  Last week she texted after 4 months and was nice for 5 days and went back to being a b tch and I drank 2 bottles of wine woke up with a splitting headache and nothing had gotten better I've got sufficiently disproportionate breasts enough as is and wouldn't consider implants  When I fall though it tends to result in bruises on my thighs or arms  currently nursing a couple from nye   So    I don't know   Congrats  Hopefully this will be me in a few days  That is fucking awesome   I'm so proud of you  I have definitely been in the same place repeatedly  Falling down and picking myself back up got to be pretty hard after awhile  but to he completely honest I don't think I would have learned any other way  Eventually I just sort of accepted that this is my life  there can be no drinking  and that's not necessarily a bad thing  I can enjoy life so much more without drinking even if I am lonely or sad or not 100  at times  Thanks everyone  Im proud to say that I invited a good buddy over and we watched youtube videos for a few hours  It was horribly painful not smoking  but next time you guys see me I should be kicking into the 72 hour mark        This is literally so fucking hard  lol  Not going to downplay it   Prayers going out to anyone trying to quit anything  Super thankful there are no physical withdrawals with Cannabis    Edit  Gave my medicinal friend my leftover prerolls and buds  in fear that I may try to isolate the trichome heads  or smoke a doob  He forgot it all here on my desk  lol  Staying strong and going to bed  I'm not drinking with any of you tonight  Fourth night in a row sober  and I feel great   Sounds like you're doing a great job  Every day is a new great experience with quitting smoking in my opinion  Good job  I'm a beer drinker by nature   In my family we're all a mix of German Irish and Native American for Chrissakes   We drink  lol   No one really ever gets shitty drunk  we're just beer people   So  even years addicted to Kratom there was only about a 4 month period when I was dosing 3 4 times per day that I didn't at least toss back a couple of brews come nighttime   Anyways  since quitting  Day 21   I have noticed I can drink like a stud again   I can put away damn near a 12er and wake up feeling better than I did when I was taking 15g kratom at noon and drinking only 2 4 beers at night   If I ever even had 6 or more beers I would wake up feeling like absolute hell  would sometimes have to wait all day to dose it was so bad   Once  after my grandfather's wake  where the males all shared his last flask of Maker's  and about a 12 pack apiece   the next day I legitimately thought I might die   The hangover was so bad I couldn't dose all day  just slept and drank water  slept through the night  woke up the next day still slightly hurting and dosed    ANYWAYS  so what I've noticed on nights when I  do  put away 10 12 beers  is that in the morning I'll be somewhat hungover and this is the only time I'll really get a craving   Just because I know it would blank my hangover   But I just push that thought out of my head as ridiculous  and eat some breakfast  hydrate like a motherfucker  take a nice long hot shower  steam it out  then hit the gym or go for a run  sweat it out     After all this I will feel completely reset   no kratom necessary   Doing stuff like a normal person   The K must have been doing a number on my poor goddamn liver      I didn't include  but what's also worth it's weight in gold for me in hangover situation is weed   That's actually probably the best hangover cure I've found   Not for everyone  I realize  though     This is inspiring Not a big problem then  He said he'd call when he was on duty  Think he was erring on the side of caution   This experience will make you stronger for your quit now  Remember that regret  I feel your pain   One quote that I remind myself of is that "when you quit drinking your body breathes a huge sigh of relief "  As part of that  however  your bod and brain have to recalibrate without all of that fermented liquid   To the extent that you can  keep yourself distracted and appreciate that this discomfort is taking the place of the hangovers  headaches  anxiety  nausea and everything else that comes from continuing to drink   I won't drink with YOU today  cannedpenis  Really great job  Same here  I found the glamour of the "forbidden herb" quickly wear off with legalization  Prior to turning 21  drinking was wild fun  After 21  it kind of felt like a bad habit  And so it goes for weed Yes  Lem has seen them  but confidentiality and all that  I don't have any that are really discernable who she is because I do respect her privacy   Rock on   You can continue to make these positive changes   No drinking with you tonight and I'l look for your post in the morning   It's nice having that sense of smell back  That was not easy  but 6 years daily Kratom were really enough    I'm feeling much better now than during my last year with Kratom  It gets better  Just think of a time where you forgot you even smoked   Loved that one   I look at your number with absolute awe   Very well done  sir or madam   Skinny fat guy here   I'm starting stronglifts 5x5  I can't wait   You can do it  I started smoking when I was 14  I am now 38 and am only 3 weeks in  I had the same fears you do  Who am I and how do I get through life without those cigarettes  When ever I get a craving I remind myself that I am craving the nicotine not the cigarette  Smoking tastes horrible  It smells horrible  You will feel tired and look pale after having a cigarette  You won't feel good you actually feel worse  It is the high from the drug you crave and not the cigarette  I am using the patch to help me manage the drug cravings and by doing that it has helped me separate the actual addiction from the delivery method   Cigarettes will never make you feel good again  Work on managing the nicotine addiction and you will do fine   Thank you for all the replies   It feels good to know that not only do other people share these same thoughts as myself but can also stay sober with an unconventional approach to a higher power     Picked up my 30 day chip today and am gonna keep coming back   As cliche as it is  one day at a time is the best approach I can take right now   The rest will fall into place over time    Ahh yeah   I had one of those mornings the other day    Woke up thinking "wtf did i drink last night  "  Hrm   Apple juice   lol   Monday seems to be an off day in this area  for meetings  Tues   Thurs go hard  my homegroup is Wednesday   I can see the church out my bedroom window   I'm grateful for having new opportunities  and supportive family  even if it sketches me out being all open n honest  Ahhh  Thank you very much  No worries  I think about it all the time  Great job   Thanks for the encouragement   Best wishes to you left clique  I was still finding them months later  Thought I'd done a good job getting rid of all of them but drunk me was crafty    Man I don't miss that   No but don't test the boundaries  Ace bandages helped on my hands and wrists   I didn't have RLS   I wonder if tight under armor leggings or something would help    Same  unfortunately   Thanks  let's try to achieve it then  Don't know why it seems to be so true   Sober on amigo  You know that thing you did that one time that haunts you  Forgive yourself for it  I wish I could've given myself that advice about 2 years ago  Yes and if we can implement it here  everyone can be helped  I wrote something earlier that I was going to post  It's very long and very personal  but I think it would benefit people like you AND me    It's a little late now  and it needs some revising   But keep your eyes out for it  man  Thanks for the kind words  man    Right before I quit I had a half g on me  and a g in my safe  I domed the whole half g because I knew I was weak and have no willpower        THEN  I flipped the g out of my safe to a friend with his medicinal card  Because again  I have no willpower       Someone mentioned getting rid of glass  I'm working on that one     Someone said this quote a few days ago "Look at it like you can puff  but you have to reset the clock to do it  Do you really wanna trade the 15 20 minute high for the hours days you've banked at being sober " So I took it very literal  and I have been using my iphone stopwatch  It's really accomplishing to have a craving  then check your phone and see that you're beginning to stack those damn hours  days  weeks     Love you guys  Thank you all  Take note of the victories at work too  When I was newly sober I tried to consciously notice little things like how I felt in the morning  not shitty  or how I was going to have a little extra time after work since I wasn't going to have to make the liquor store trip    Little things add up and at the end of the week it's nice to have fresh reminders of why we're doing this  Happy sober start or work  I'm so glad you chose to write this up  That's one hell of a way to hit rock bottom  It's something you have to look at in the mirror every day    Hopefully  I've got many many more days in my sober journey  and I'll always remember your story of how quickly the accumulated gold stars can be blown away  I've got a blackberry soda that I'm raising right now   to never relapsing again  You can do it too  Love the username also Two planker here  Will be going skiing this coming weekend without regard for the apres ski drinking scene  I can't even begin to guess how many times I missed early morning turns due to being hung over   Congrats on your year  Sober on  my friend     There is absolutely no need to call yourself an alcoholic or to identify as such  You can just be someone who recognizes that drinking has caused them problems and they want to improve their life    AA works for some people  Personally  I don't care for it  I've been sober for almost five years now and I don't attend AA meetings    Most people who recognize they have a problem with alcohol can't imagine life without it  This means they usually try to moderate instead of outright quitting  Some people can manage to do this  The vast majority cannot  I tried moderation several times before I gave in and admitted to myself that it was going to be all or nothing    Moderation for people like me wouldn't really be that great anyway  I don't want to spend my life consumed with thoughts of when and where it will be acceptable for me to have the next drink  I have better things to do with myself    My life isn't defined by addiction or alcohol  As I said  I have been sober for a bit now and I don't really consider being "the guy who got sober" to be who I am  The whole point of quitting unhealthy habits is to move on with your life    Hope that helps some  I would honestly say the Cannabis flower on the streets  hell  even being distributed by Licensed Producers under the canadian government is pure poison   When you concentrate it  you're concentrating anything that is still in the buds  So if it's poison and pesticides  you're going to have a nasty final product    Literally the only way of consuming properly grown dried cured extracted meds is by producing it yourself  Which is why I worked my butt off becoming legal  and now I've developed  a bitter sweet relationship with my main girl  jane    Another night down  guys  Off to bed  Hope you all are as happy as I am feeling as I type this  Thank you all  again    That is fantastic   I'd have it tatoo'd on myself if there was room           Go to a cardiologist  That's a huge jump  props   I'm with you  tomorrow's the first day back to work after 17 days off   I agree with PFBL  I think you're about to turn a corner     2 days ago I thought I really turned  then yesterday was rougher  but then today has been my best day yet   So I can conclude it is definitely finally starting to get better  albeit 2 steps forward  one step back   I think you'll be ok going back to work   Your body and brain know the motions  you'll probably do them without much struggle   It may even help throw that switch where you start feeling improved     Best of luck and stay strong  Getting to the point where I hated drinking as much as I hated being sober was a tipping point for me  It was one of the most isolating points in my life and I was trying to figure out the secret formula to bring me back to the joys I used to get from drinking  I swore off hard liqour  only drank at home  gave up my drug of choice   I couldn't figure out why I was so miserable when booze helped me for so long  When my depression was bad enough I sought help from a therapist which helped me a lot  Getting sober was an incredibly lonely task for me  but as a result I learned how to communicate more effectively and started spending time around healthier people  This did wonders for my self esteem and I slowly learned how to cope without the alcohol   She sounds delightful   I hate rooming with random people   Only experience was when I moved into a sober house   First gal I shared a room with was great as she was never there      Second girl   not so fucking much but not that bizarre   I only lasted a couple weeks though and then was kicked out for drinking  Maybe I'll skip having kids   lol I loved Carolina House in NC  I've been there a couple times and it's the best I've been  though everywhere else I've been is inpatient  not residential    They let you make your own food  That was huge to me to help me get over the fear of being in the kitchen and trying non safe foods  It's DBT based and the staff is amazing    Have you searched edtreatmentreview com  I understand that and as others have suggested  getting rid of the hidden bottles and empties is great   I thought I had everything cleared out of various hiding spots around the house  On Day 21  I found an empty mickey of vodka hidden my sock draw and an empty bottle of wine hidden in the garage  Who knows which binge those were from     UGH  I may still find one  but it goes out with all of the others and no new ones to replace them     Today   Best wishes to you  That's awesome   I will not drink with you tonight  Also  yeah  cake   yum lol  What a game  Lots of points on the board   Much more fun clear headed   Free alcoholic drinks on my flight out to California  and they always seem surprised when I decline  Will admit I was rooting for USC which made the finish even more exciting   I hope it gets better quickly for you  That's awesome  I'm almost done with day 3 as well  It's tough because my husband still smokes  and smokes around me  All I wanted to do when I got home from work was to light up  Instead  I took my dog to the park and cooked dinner  Progress  Hang in there  the worst will be over soon and it will get easier to say no every day   You got it   Get some supplements  herbal stuff  anything not addicting dangerous to help you out   Lots of useful information in the wiki and help here if you need it      Just stay with it and remember it will get better with time   Sometimes I forget a big reason why I quit  my health   Kratom was sucking the life out of us   No more  Yeah    I stayed in my room alone a lot but now she's ALWAYS HERE talking and driving me insane  Like DOES NOT SHUT UP EVER   I seriously told someone that I wasn't gonna pay my phone bill today because I predicted going to jail for knocking her out  Lolol   still wondering why a person would ''dislike'' this thread     Yes  it has been a very odd winter so far  for sure  I was thinking the same thing  They have no right to put you or any other neighbors through this and deserved to be called out  This isn't narking on them  this is taking a stand for your rights  Thanks for sharing  Have you read The Naked Mind book  If not    I have found it to be incredibly helpful  and you can get it free in this subreddit in the community info    if you have read it maybe reread    or just take some time to remind your unconscious mind why you stopped drinking in the first place    i e  Alcohol is poison  happier without it  healthier without it    what you could lose if you go back down that path    etc     Good luck to you   Yep never fallen on my boobs    But I have some incredible bruises on my ass  thighs and arms right now  Christ  that dude is crazy obstinate and hateful  What a beautiful number to be celebrating   Respect  respect   Reading posts from those leading us to better days do inspire   I feel like life is getting better and sobriety is getting easier with each and every new day   Does it just continue to get better for you   Does your confidence and sense of self worth continue to evolve  I have been using the patch and it works for me  Put the patch on as soon as you wake up in the morning or after your shower  Start with the first stage which has the highest dose of nicotine  You will feel a rush after about 20 minutes kind of like you get from smoking but more intense  I found that the stage 1 patches were a little too much for me but the 2nd stage wasn't enough so I kept on stage 1 for about a week  The cravings you get while on the patch are more of habitual cravings  You might find yourself going all day without even thinking about smoking  If you keep the patch on while you sleep you will probably get some vivid dreams  For me I actually look forward to them  It's like watching a great movie lol  The next day before your morning shower take the old patch off and put a new one on after the shower in a different location  You will be surprised how much it works  I am on week three and already down to stage 3 but don't rush it  Take all the time you need  And if you start feeling nauseous or dizzy take it off and go down to a lower dose when you feel better  Good luck   It might be kind of amazing I've never fallen on my boobs though  FFs  so they take up most of the front of my body   Well done  my friend  Polar pink grapefruit salute     Can she sleep more than you too    Can't tell if she'd be worse or not as far as roommates go  Almost sounds crazier but maybe more independent  Can't even imagine  Though I have taken half hour one way cab ride to boost liquor from a grocery store  so maybe she's just careful and smart like me  Lol  Hope it's a little better with her though  Wishing you luck loomster I was wondering what line of work you were in  Regardless  I'm obviously on the wrong one haha  The difference for me is the day after  The day after drinking I woke up embarrassed or regretful  I've never woken up embarrassed that I went to the gym the night before  Yes     And she goes an hour away because she's convinced her husband can track her if she plugs her phone in  etc   HA  There actually used to be a Beatles cover band in my town called the Shitty Beatles and I always tried to get the door guy to play along with this joke but no one got it    Thanks  I am at 104 days off opiates  benzos  and booze  I would say my biggest recollection is that 2 months in was when the newness  and excitement  of sobriety started to fade for me a bit  I wasn't having constant mind blowing epiphanies or moments of child like awe anymore  I haven't noticed more than brief moments of depression or anxiety  but toward the end of my third month I started to get some cravings again  I had so hoped those were gone permanently   Nothing too overwhelming  just some minor reminiscing  which I do not indulge  I shut it down when I find myself romanticizing  and a couple of crazy thoughts about  needing  prescription meds  lol  that I just had to work through   I become fearful when I get a craving because I think it might mean relapse  but just yesterday I found a painkiller on the floor in my parents bathroom  I wanted to take it so fucking badly  I sat there and rolled it around between my fingers for a good half hour  Then I flushed it  I would have never had that strength before  I didn't even feel good after I did it  more disappointed that I couldn't get high  But that faded  Today I realized that was strong of me    So the victories keep on coming but it definitely loses a little of its shine  I think at 2 3 months is when you really have to start to work if you want to obtain maintain happiness and contentment  I think I can break this maudlin spell by renewing my exercise routine and improving my diet  the holidays have been hell for me nutritionally speaking     Good luck to you    Congratulations  One whole year of memories     Where I'm from it's the 9 month chip  the 3 month chip is the plastic red one I cut my finger cleaning my mirror and I screamed like a little bitch  I was convinced I was going to bleed out  I didn't  That was a close one  I can see a lot of this making sense   For me  it helped to make a plan  hold myself accountable to it  and just take it one day at a time  Nice  I'm having deja vu  As a drunk  I've heard those aren't a bad way to go  As a drunk  you're not a drunk   Welcome     I also had a slip and fall accident recently   I broke my ankle  just had surgery and can't walk on it for months   I'm a bit further along in my sobriety journey  but not by much    I have also cried over this and what a massive pain in the ass it is   But  I'm glad I'm sober going through it and I also see it as an opportunity to stay sober and continue to focus on sobriety    I'll raise a crutch to you and not drink with today   Make some popcorn and put on a movie    go for a walk    take a salt bath    read a fiction book on the couch    have a mug of really nice tea    drink some sparkling water with lemon essential oil    listen to a guided meditation      I've realized these things help me to relax so much more deeply than alcohol ever did    Hope this helps trigger something that can help you     Alcohol does cause short term memory loss    I blame my dejavu on my parents though  it's much more convenient   My lawyers are going to be calling   There are many paths  Find yours  I went to AA for one week about 9 months ago  The first day I missed a meeting  I drank  So I was then using AA as a crutch instead of my own will power  I drank for two more months and finally quit one day because I got sick with shingles  Haven't drank since and I'm doing it with this place and daily "playing it forwards" when I want to drink  I agree with you and that's how it felt to me  I'm glad it helps some though  That's how I felt about my second roommate   She just wouldn't shut the fuck up   It was nonstop and I couldn't stand it  Just seems like a hard way to fall  I am a lawyer  He didn't break any laws  sorry    My OO caps fit  5 G Although when I weighed it  it was slightly less  I didn't go out of my way to pack tightly  but my powder was quite fine  Same thing here  I'm going to a meeting everyday and all the while I'm taking Kratom  However  I absolutely have the DESIRE to stay sober  and that's the only requirement  right   2 5 months is a short habit  Get out while the gettin is good  The entire way Kratom works changes at some point  For me  it was around maybe 1 5 years  It took me a good many months to actually become dependent like I have   to where I couldn't get up without dosing  You are so smart that you're handling this now  U do not want this   Not at all  I've been sober since I feel out of my mother's puss  What is alcohols  Congratulations  soberdude1   That's very inspiring   I'll hit two years smoke free January 6th after 40  years of smoking the same amount daily as you   We're proof it's never too late to quit     I know EXACTLY what you're talking about   Total anhedonia  when I don't have marijuana it's almost like I feel life is gray and worthless   I don't enjoy doing anything without it   But when I even think about smoking  I almost get a high from it   It can always  without fail  brighten my mood and bring a smile to my face  And that fucking sucks  I used to enjoy doing everything from walking to just sitting in my car with a friend or two and talking  Now I feel like I have to smoke before any of that  Stay strong brother Very cool  You went after it  Once I quit I just stopped applying for jobs unfortunately  I couldn't gain the motivation  nor did I have the concentration  However  I feel like it's coming back now   finally  So I'm gonna get on that  Thanks  If you're currently growing while simultaneously quitting    heavy duty props my friend  I can't imagine experiencing that sweet skunky smell of fresh plants and not blazing  Also  I am starting to completely agree with you on the poison part  I refuse to consume any dabs after reading that report I linked  After working on farms  I got to see the underbelly of what's going on and I wasn't very impressed  When growers have a pest mold problem and the stakes are high  "organic" goes out the window and pesticides get dumped in  No one's going to cut their crop down and start fresh just because they are dedicated to producing quality buds and encountered an issue   And yet those same people continue to call their product 'pure' just because their intentions were Sorry  addictionkiller1  your post has

and in a figurative way  I'm going to have to remember that one   It's what happens when you want to kill yourself  but you have like this thing called family  and thus  you can't bring yourself to it  so you drink   I used 8 years  last few of those was strong extracts  Quitting was a big old pain in my ass  but over forty days clean now  You can do it  I can agree with that  All the other symptoms I expected but my eyes are blood shot and burn and I have been nonstop with eye drops today  Please update on ur progress   I'm gonna be sending u good wishes and positive thoughts  U got this  like u said    Oh wow  never even heard of that place but I'll have to check it out  I know that would be a big part of recovery after treatment as being served most meals is just unrealistic  Ironically  I worked in an ED IOP program and found this to be a drawback  Good thing for me to keep in mind in asking other treatment centers as well   I haven't searched them or even knew about them really  so I'll be sure to do that  Thank you   I was way too good at it  I'd buy a specific kind of alcohol  in a plastic bottle  klassy  right  so it'd fit in my purse  Dump the empties at the grocery store on my way in to buy more  More than once I'd hide one in a new place at home and panic the next morning when I couldn't immediately find it  frightened my bf at the time would find it instead   Having nothing to hide is so much more peaceful  Great read     Yeah     OD   Death do NOT stop your pain     dealing with it  with a sober mind  and goals   that really does work     I'm with you guys  new years quitters unite  Have you tried melatonin for sleep  I used to use it when I lived in a country where it was too hard to get weed  I am lawyer  Ask me a legal question   I used to worry about not drinking EVERYWHERE  It gets easier and the benefits of not drinking show up rather quickly  Then you reason with your self that it's  truly better to have the sober benefits than the alcohol remorse  Imagine your wedding  imagine the black out  The potential for a nightmare  You drive black out drunk  wreck and kill your spouse that night  Your life is now going to be spent in jail  Keep playing it forward  My brother drove drunk and hit a tree two doors down from his house   His neighbors called the police and he was arrested for dwi  He was on the wagon for two years after that  As a result of the DWI  He went to jail and rehab  That was 12 years ago   Now hes been off the wagon for three years   His answer now is that he drinks at home into oblivion while holding down a job at night   Recently I noticed him getting behind the wheel again evidenced in pictures   Im really scared that he is going back to the same pattern    tried mixing it with sprite when i was about 16  couldn't stomach it  I still find it particularly difficult to go a day without a drink   which I RARELY do  There is nothing about this statement which remotely makes you "CLEAN ish"   How many drinks do you average per week   And how strong is that lager         edit spelling If I call you a nigger is that a hate crime   Thank you   I really appreciate your comments   I replaced alcohol with exercise and sugar  I realize that the sugar part needs work  but for now it's working out okay and it's better for me than drinking  People depending on me don't mind me being at the gym or eating some ice cream  but they do mind me being drunk when I'm needed  You are not alone  Im creeping up on my 1 year chip and ive been in quite a funk  It actually makes me feel a little better to hear im not alone in that      Thank you for posting  Tomorrow will be better  For both of us Ha  If I got a  2 500 a week raise I'd be so damn happy I wouldn't give a shit about WD's    Two things that don't go together  Good Judgment   Drinking   Two things that do  Selfishness   Drinking   We've all been there and have the pile of regrets to reflect on   Don't let that pile grow any larger   Put it in the rear view mirror and leave it behind   Not drinking with you today   There is help if you are willing to seek it   By coming here you are clearly taking the first of what hopefully will be many steps forward  You got this  I quit the same day as you  It's not been going so smoothly for me but I'm glad you're having a positive experience  Noticeable improvements in anxiety weird depressing thoughts  Thought about opiates much less often  Like days would go by     and I'd realize  shit  5 days have gone by and I didn't notice      Month 3 4 is when I redeveloped a whole new gratitude about being clean  And people might say pink cloud   well    yee haw I'll ride it then  It was also that time of year where it got warmer and I could spend time in the sun  And water      You don't have to look forward to an incoming detox  Woot    How are you holding up  You're an inspiration man        it helps if you add something new to your routine  So You don't fall back into bad habits or thinking stinky thoughts  Last year I made some significant changes in my life  I moved  started up a hobby I was passionate about  got a promotion  But I still find myself wasting away in front of a screen on a pretty consistent basis  I have so much I want to accomplish  and playing Final Fantasy for 100 hours is not helping   My plan is to give up games for a month  Here we go  Like  I'm not sure what you're going on about   I had tried several times as well  Every time I quit smoking a woman would drive me back  I wasn't even dating any of them  but I allowed them to get to me so much that the only way I felt I could make myself feel better was to smoke  In one of my other comments I talk about brushing my teeth constantly  That helped a lot  When I was drinking that was the hardest time  But after about a month or two I knew I had beaten it  It was the hardest thing I've ever had to do  But coming through on the other side is the best feeling I've ever had   https   www reddit com r stopsmoking comments yy8xy quit over three years ago and am new to this sub   This was a post I made a few years ago detailing my story  I hope it helps Ughh  That's some pretty heavy paranoia  Unless her husband is really with the CIA or the NSA or the HIV  then she needs all the help she can get  Hang in there   it's tough enough having new roommates  but having no real choice in the matter is exceptionally more difficult   That is sweet  sweet love  Keep going     Thank you  I mean if you fall forward    that would be on my boobs   Yes  I couldn't agree more      Thank you so much  I wish I could give you a strategy  but I haven't been able to escape this pit  and the situation you described  long work day  is always a trigger for me  If it helps  I'm sending you strength  focus willpower on your decision to be sober  Easier said than done  but sobriety is our default state  and we take that for granted  Being sober is a high in and of itself  Stay strong brother Mental Resolve  Stay strong  Your mind will quit before you do  Be strong  PM me if you need help Mostly just like suicide and alienation  but I mean we could talk about how the Falcons are totally going to beat the Pats in the Superbowl this year   You can do this and it may not always be easy  you will feel better all in all if you make this change  I'm rooting for you  Good job taking this step  You've got this  It's the vacant look in her eyes that made my dick hard    Like you could ask her "whats your name " And she'd have no idea    And then you give her a drink    Seems like I'm seeing this posted all over the fucking sub today   But I'm still having fun here so fuck it  Not following you  bud  I have a trim jar that HAS to be at least 30  thc   TRIM   I am quite proud of my ability to produce  Right now I switched everything to the following    Tomatoes  Rio Grande  Beefstake   Jellybean  Peppers  Sweet chilli  green  Kale Spinach Cilantro Echinacea tea and a couple indoor castor beans  lol   I'm going to try and produce pounds of veggies this winter for friends and family  instead of qp's and slabs for personal consumption   Oddly enough  growing and tending to Cannabis is just as satisfying  if not MORE THAN smoking it  Well said  Good job taking this step for yourself  We're here to support you  I prefer opiates   Yeah  im on day 20 something    This go  i'm avoiding alcohol  thx vivitrol   meh   but it's legit  and i'm working it  and its working   keep it up   live your dreams  we never lose our demons  we only learn to live above them First chuckle today fuckwad    Nice work   Wow  ur a tough SOB  that's a big drop  I remember doing c t off major opiate habits and thinking by the second week   I cannot go on  It's not getting better  I'll never be normal again  I could barely get through the day  For me  the third week was where it would turn around substantially  And at this point  you're used to feeling crappy  so that improvement is gonna feel amazing  If only we KNEW when we were gonna turn the corner  it would be so much easier  Point is that 17 days is a heck of a long way in  You're gonna start feeling better really soon  I bet  Please keep going   Don't u deserve it after the last 17 days   One thing I learned on my taper was how effective a  5g dose can be   I was dosing every two hours   5 g at the end  for a total of about 4g a day  It's true it's more of a step than a jump at that point  A taper keeps a lot of monsters from the door  but the discipline is grueling  So we can schedule the orgy   I will not drink with you  Welcome  Almost the same situation as you  Good job and good income  Maxed everything out self medicating my depression    You gotta embrace the suck  The worst of it will be over by 30 days and sleep will return by then  Your body and mind can't go 7 days without sleep so you'll crash  Lots of showers and baths my friend  For the first couple of weeks I would routinely fall asleep in the bath or the bathroom floor with the shower on  For whatever reason  the sound of a shower and the constant ambient noise soothed my brain    Try to fight the physical and mental symptoms in your imagination  I know it sounds weird but picture them as something physical in your imagination and defeat them there  A video game monster or an imaginary army worked well for me  So did imagining a fight  The mental anguish is tormenting so being able to defeat them feels good  Try it    Try to be active during the day  Go for a walk and eat some crackers  Get out of the house  Go to the animal shelter and walk a dog  Anything to keep your mind busy   I feel the same way  All that time I could of been learning real life skills but  I was in game working on different characters  items  gear  helping friends guildmates  grinding and all that  Doing achievements that aren't real achievements  just something that others made and or have deemed achievements when I could of been working on my achievements and my  circle of control  http   static wixstatic com media fec33e f2b3d567591a4512a617ba25560a943f jpg   I wasn't proactive  only reactive and it got me nowhere   You've done something that you'll never regret  that will make your life so much better  You got this and we're here if you need someone to talk with or to     For real  I work two jobs  I'm tired of catering to people  If I'm IN BED ON MY PHONE NOT RESPONDING TO YOU then let me relax    I lost my headphones or I'd just put them in     I fell one night blacked out cracked my head on concrete stairs bled all over them  Went to sleep with a crack in my head woke with blood in my bed  The next night I walked over the blood on the stairs out the door to get drunk again  I never was a huge drinker in high school but the disease progressed in me through my 20's and first half of my 30's  What I am trying to illustrate is your minor falls and mishaps might eventually become more and more severe   Where did you eat ramen   Hate to say this  but realtalk  easy and persistent bruising is a major indicator of serious liver issues   If it's getting worse  you really might want to get serious about quitting while you have a chance     Or not   Up to you  Ouch  I had a nurse friend who had a Pepsi and isopropyl mix    Like omg  I couldn't get how she drank it   i had a dream like this last night  i had a full relapse and spent hours watching porn  and i hated myself for it  then i woke up  '  I haven't made it back into the gym regularly yet  I know I'd benefit from it and should go    Running has been what works for me for now  It's just so convenient  I put on shorts and shoes  go outside and run    I'd prefer to cycle but that takes lots of gear and decent weather  And it takes like 4x the time of running for the "same" workout  I think one of the major hurdles of the gym for me is that I actually have to go  I always enjoyed it once I was there  Having a gym buddy probably will help  I'm letting someone else down too if I bail and there accountability in that   Kratom seems to have its own special gloom and doom reaction it dishes out when you try to walk away  I've never experienced anything like it  That shit is so not real  never forget that  Doe   That's almost Wizard Level Trolling in its transparency  You have to admire the commitment to his cause  While still a social media cunt fuck looking for attention  witness the beauty of even mentioning the Patriots potentially winning anything    Really  I raise a glass to how masterful this stupid piece of shit thread is and how we can just point and laugh    Ladies and Gentlemen     Cue the irony from "I'm 14 and what is this  " What a great story   As Dr  Seuss might say   she was eating a cake in the tub  yes she was  Haha  I was like 'damn  that dudes loaded  Lucky he didn't get crazy into the extracts with all that money   '  Dude  it's spam and that you're vouching for him only makes you suspicious  Kratom is fine with me  I've not tried it and it doesn't bother me personally that people talk about here  although I am feeling pretty sure this is spam just based on my previous experience observing reddit spammers  Any decent redditor sharing information would know better to have linked to a neutral source  At least she's not carpet farming yet   Thank god  That means I won't ever think of you again in like 30 minutes   that's the stage i'm at now   my 30 days is coming up quick   i had a good chunk of clean time 10 years ago  tho   For me   it's the feeling of MATURITY   being real  being happy with the choices i make  being able to handle things with a mature  well thought mind   it's a blessing   but   you can't see it if you don't know to look for it    i put my childish ways away  and put my foot forward  as a man    and so i continue to walk  My life sucks for two days straight after I do any substantial amount of gaming  Yours probably does  too    Take the opportunity to notice how bad the hangover is  and remember that the next time you consider gaming   Link to a neutral source  yo  It is impossible to  form an independent opinion from a biased source  It looks super duper spammy and I don't really believe you're not a marketer or salesman  I worry a lot about complications and surgery further down the line  I injured some tendons pretty badly  And high five  we've got this  Can I just say I fucking love you  You're too brilliant  Keep it up  Your why reddit is awesome Relapse happens  it's hard for any kind of person to just up and completely quit gaming  alcohol  drugs  food addictions  Just get back up and try again  This time you will succeed because there's nothing holding you back        The only competition you have is with yourself  even if it's fun against others    don't try  just "do"        also    don't "try too hard"   let it happen   allow it   I believe in you   That's exactly what it is  your body is clearing out the buildup  1 gram a day and it messed w  u that badly  Holy hell   how can I quit 20 grams   Really scares me    I live in NJ but saw them in Wallingford CT  I can't remember the name of the venue though   I can see you are only interested in leading people down a path that serves your own interest  based on how desperate you are to keep that sales link up and how quickly you insult everyone here  Nice  pump out those veggies  Forget the THC and get the lycopene levels up in those tomaters  Nice job on the 30     that's impressive especially for trim  We hit 27  with outdoor trainwreck this last season and it was a solid accomplishment  Nopers It was easier to think of myself as an addict addicted to alcohol  at first  enhhhh  melatonin makes me really groggy in the morning  I only like it because it gives me really lucid dreams   Marketing is sales by another name  I think for many of us it's more of an opposite land dick measuring contest   like "let's see if anyone on here is worse than me so I can stop feeling like shit be less afraid of dying before I'm 35" Contgratulations to you and your good friend's son   I wish you both continued success in putting addiction behind you   7 years is a tremendous accomplishment  The second greatest reward you can have  next to your own sobriety  is the knowledge and comfort of helping a close friend in great need   It's been far too long since I've prayed and I thank you for giving me the reminder and the reason   Prayers and thoughts to you and your good friends son   Wishing you both well  Wanna say Kambi Ramen House on 14th near Union Square   You don't heat meth  it dissolves just fine without it That's what my ex wife said while she fucked my ex ex wife  After that experience  I decided that the bottom of the bottle was my best friend  At the same time  I found that calling my clients niggers in courts had an odd effect on the judge  they all got lesser sentences  I remember bringing down a felony to a misdemeanor  The judge was like "DRUGS " and I was like  "This NIGGER  and then I pointed to him  had a lot of Xanax  Your Honor  I take more Xanax than this NIGGER on a weekly basis  and I'm not a NIGGER " The judge stared at me  and he said  "Son  I do more COKE than your poor white ass  your poor white ass couldn't afford the coke that I do  because you're a public defender  and you're a bitch  I fuck two whores and then my wife before I go to sleep    Your NIGGER should probably kill himself  but if you run this coke for my dealer across the state line for the next year  then  I will give you your NIGGER less than a year in jail and a misdemeanor "   Logically  I took the plea bargain      Meth is completely water soluble and dissolves easily without heat I was sober when this happened  I've never injured myself when drunk luckily  But your case sounds horrifying  I'm sorry that happened to you  I'm terrified that it could be me years later if I don't break this cycle right now  Its just reteaching your brain to not go "lets smoke" i used to get that dopamine drip when i thought about raving because of the ecstasy and after a while i noticed how it was effecting me physically and mentally and the pleasure dulled  Same with weed just because its a daily thing its so much harder and not just a "i wont go out tonight" need to reteach our brains how to live the normal life and not depend on a smoke to make things enjoyable and time pass   You're over the worst hump  You've got this   This is the best feeling  Knowing you have and can say no when around friends family smoking  Just dont go "i did it before i can treat myself this time" you will most likely fall back to the same routine  atleast i do  Me too  Good Job  You must be a cunt then  it can't be me   It's very uncommon  I looked into basically every residential treatment center in the country  and this was the only one that let you in the kitchen to prepare your own food  Good luck  I unexpectedly had to go into the hospital for 10 days  It turned out to be an enforced detox that launched my sober journey  and a year and a half later  I still haven't had a drink  Sorry about your injury  but your idea to take this accident and look at it as a wonderful opportunity is excellent  I prefer Fentanyl   Dicks  I don't know where I'd be without this group either     I wish like hell that sobriety   total happiness  rainbows  and the like   But I'm learning that some days I just gotta get through and wait wish work for a better tomorrow   Hang in there  I hope to god you never have to go through what I have fighting alcohol addiction and I don't even know you  That is how bad it can be  that you wish a complete stranger never has to walk in your shoes  You are banned from  r pyongyang   Basically  if you check

hang of it again  But I will continue to call my sponsor and go to meetings  Keep it up man  Never again  First off  welcome  Second  I'd recommend figuring out what your triggers are  What sets a picking episode off  Once you figure that out  tips and tricks will be easier to find    Edit  a word Very soon  I'll never forget feeling like a 90 year old     I would just keep pushing   Do not use bc of this symptom  It will pass  Just had a look and its not available OTC in UK  theres alternatives on Amazon but reviews are a bit hit and miss and i think they aren't really what im after  If she's definitely an addict and not just schizophrenic or something the yeah just wait for it  That is certainly a rough boat to be in   There's obviously gotta be something down there I just gotta find it  I know I dropped some crumbs  I saw at least a few specks  where's the rest    Just recently started getting tatted out myself  What all you got  So I got the quote "I'm just trying to be somebody I can talk to in the morning with a smile" Have an appointment on thursday for my first piece of art  Glad you're here  I might be totally off here  but you're at a low dose  I remember tapering off Suboxone   not sure if you're familiar but it's notoriously nightmarish to get off   anyway  I tapered very low but no matter how long I stayed at the little doses  I always felt moderately crappy   like I just couldn't adjust  Finally  I ended up just quitting altogether  since I already felt yucky anyway  I had an ibogaine treatment set up for three weeks later  I ended up totally getting over those yucky symptoms well before that  My effing legs ached my whole taper bit stopped once I quit completely  Go figure  I think it's possible that as long as we are feeding our body a little bit of something addictive  it could throw symptoms at us to draw us back in  You're doses are pretty darn small  Maybe if u just jump off  your body will understand that there ain't no more coming and it's over  done  accept it    By the way  congrats on your taper this far  That's a long way in a pretty short time  Plus u kicked the Tram  which is HUGE  Hope ur giving yourself the credit that u deserve  Maybe ur not totally finished  but you're sooooo dang clooosssseee        Did you seriously IV that shit and survive  How much did you IV    EDIT  I'm serious about the suicide  I'm thinking about getting some Carfentanil   You and me both man  Made it through my boozed up familys holiday shindigs  Let's keep going Op is a fucking wack job smhh I can completely relate to that  Alcohol can definitely make you feel more confident and on top of the world    For me  it was out of boredom  I guess when I get bored  I get anxious  And when I get anxious  I think too much  So drinking helped me relax  At first I only drank on my nights off  But after dealing with the heroin addicts I started drinking during the daytime on my days off as well  Never got to the point where I was always downing alcohol  but whole days would disappear   What really did it in for me is that I've been going through a confidence spike lately  But alcohol always just makes me feel a billion times worse  I would drink a little to feel good  but that good feeling turned to shit always but the 4th drink  Waking up still drunk this morning was the final nail in that coffin  I can't keep doing it anymore  It enhances nothing and slowly turns you into a zombie  I may have misinterpreted the article over on NoFap  but I think there's a difference between a reset and a relapse  http   www nofap com rebooting thank you for responding  we all have our woe is me moments    definitely telling myself to be patient  sometimes feels like time is moving very slowly since I quit  hope you're doing well       wow  we have the same story       Good luck  man  We're all in this together  My detox is similar  You got this  fam  It's not easier  but literally just keep coming back here  and keep talking to us  It's been helping me like crazy   Drop me  Streak lasted seven days  but had a reset  How's the cravings   I'm at Day 8 and my cravings have become manageable   It's a really sensitive spot  I'm not a pube puller  I shave everything there  but I tweeze the creases and I wouldn't recommend tweezing more than one hair at a time  I wouldn't use an epilator  I'd imagine it would cause a lot of inflammation if I were to use one  Thanks  My ex was mad cuz I don't send him flicks  We're kinda fuck buddies now  It's just not the damn same  Ah well  my cocktail is working wonders  Off to bed now   go to bed  Sad part is at one point I was probably spending close to that a month on a ground up freaking tree leaf   I was clearly a dumbass  I've got more Scotch to drink though  Sorry bud   I noticed that whenever I quit  while the nicotine is still in my body  I'll like the smell of someone that just smoked or of smoke in general  Once the initial cravings are gone the smell will become gross   Well that is odd   That stopwatch thing is an awesome idea  I just started mine  And definitely  definitely  definitely write out whatever long  personal anecdotes you have  I'll be sure to read them if you post  Whenever you feel the urge  come back to them and read them and remind yourself    And as far as getting rid of paraphernalia goes  I just texted one of my friends and told him I'd give him my dab pen with the rest of my dabs  and a homemade hookah that I spent quite a while on  While it may be sad to see some of that sentimental type stuff go  it'll certainly be a weight off my shoulders to be rid of the temptation   Congratulations  How did you do it   Has anyone been to Avalon Hills  Thank you for your response  My biggest trigger is definitely stressful situations  even the smallest thing could set me off on a picking spree  Also  I also tend to "search" my body with my hands to look for things to pick  My skin isn't even bad  but my picking makes it bad  Lastly  looking in the mirror and "inspecting" my skin  looking for the slightest flaw  I guess stay away from the mirrors  or at least a safe distance when standing in front of them   I love that program I been doing it for months and have gotten a lot stronger   This program and not drinking has improved my golf game and life in so many positive ways  I'm trying to decide if you're just trolling with this   You know these "perfect" women  that your girlfriend is not as "hot" as  aren't even real  right   The glossy magazines don't even come close to the world of airbrushed women that the internet has to offer   That said  if you're being serious  you might want consider seeing a therapist to talk this out  first   And maybe hold off on the marriage until you have a little more respect for your fianc   It's not just the ogling models online that's a problem   It's the overall nature in which you view her  and her  possible  feelings about it  that comes across as disrespectful  just stop watching porn  my advice would be to stay busy and focus on the areas of your life that you have being neglecting i e friends and family  physical health  mental health  your wants and needs  things like that  just don't even think about porn  goodluck and watch out for your triggers Anything is possible man  I always thought it was some harmless drug like coffee and would throw back  5g before work and another  5g during work for a mile boost and it worked but I guess always doing that everyday for 8 months really really messed me up near the end  You got it don't worry  I took half a 5mg at 1 today and of course I can't sleep keep having racing thoughts   I think opiates make me manic idk  I'm just gonna lay here until my brain gives out or until the sun comes up but I did this to myself     sign me up Definitely  sobriety first  success in all facets later   Omg  I did the purse thing too   So embarrassing to think about that now    Congrats on one week  You've got this  Appreciate it   Me and you both  Congrats comrade   Fair enough   What you do now  Saying you've never done street 'opis' expect H is like saying I've never smoked weed expect for weed  Like seriously  What do you consider street 'opis'   fucking Chinese opium from the 19th century                                      Anyways  I imagine all your IVs have been done in a controlled and legit medical environment       Welcome  we're glad to have you     Day 19  I visited a relative and there's 15 1mg dilaudid tablets in the medicine cabinet  There was no way in hell I would take one but god damn did I want to  I've been drunk or high for over 3 years whenever I felt down and now that I'm not reaching for anything I'm not sure how to deal  PAWS notwithstanding  Booze doesn't feel good anymore though  just makes me more exhausted and tense  At least I'm sleeping decently again  Dude  good on you  Those strong ones can be really hard to tough out  Suggestion for next time  take a walk  or go somewhere where you can't look at it  It's one thing to resist it  but another when you take away the option entirely  stay strong man  I'm microwaving a Fentanyl patch on a burrito right now  I hope to eat it in a few seconds and not wake up to scum like yourself   It could be a gateway to the internet  so I'd get rid of them  but that's just me  Whether or not you want to quit porn  I think that deleting pictures and videos like those is always a smart plan after a break up  Even more so in the pornfree scenario  where removing  digital  visual stimuli out of your sex life is the goal   I kept it a secret from everyone for four years  I had pretty much become a loner from it anyways so I didn't really have anyone to tell  My ex wife found some while we were going thru a bad divorce and tried to act like it was fucking black tar heroine or something  Brought it up in court and everything  They even tried to drug test me for it in an attempt to get the kids from me    didn't work tho  Other than that nobody ever knew in my four years of taking the stuff and like you said the few that saw me do it or whatever didn't have a clue what it was anyways    This site will really help you with the support that you need since you don't have it elsewhere  Does me anyways  Good luck  The thing is  my dear  you will wake up to "scum" like us   Read the sidebar  Ah  good call  10 years on  2 days off   Coughing yellow phlegm every 15 minutes or so   I'm expecting that  day 20 I'll be breathing like a normal person   Or else I have lung cancer   Hm  Tell that to the judge  Sign me up please  happy 2017 and good luck everyone  Not really  I've got a handle of Scotch  two handfuls of benzos  60 crushed and dissolved pills  I'm about to ingest  and actually it's  3 mcg of Fentanyl  I mean  I'm about to try it  if I wake up in the next few days after this  I'll just get some heaver shit and do it the messy way    Sounds like an interesting case then  I guess enjoy the change from the old tweaker roommate at least  though certainly take care of yourself around this new one and don't get sucked into all her shit  No worries we're in this together  good luck man   exercise helps more than most people know   it releases the same chemicals in the brain that booze does   shit  i need to exercise more Hi  Did your doctor give you information on how to take it   I haven't taken it myself but I know there can be some complications and it's pretty hard on your kidneys   I'd ask your doctor first and if that is not possible maybe do a google search   Best of luck to you    Great job  I too avoided drinking again today  Day 23 tomorrow   Keep it up  Awesome  Sleep well  See you tomorrow    Okay  well    I had an uncle that's much more intelligent than you are  He was dependent upon opiates for 15 20 years of his life due to medical conditions  he was dead by 55 and had ODed like 5 times prior to that  That really struck a cord with me  "learned how to love the alcoholics in my life " Christmas really makes me resent my alcoholic father  We are normally fine  but during the holidays I'm on eggshells  just waiting to see who starts a fight first  He's pretty miserable around Christmas and does a good job at making us miserable too  Just gets so drunk and who knows which moody direction he'll take it too  Anyways  I really want to learn what you were talking about  "I don't feel controlled anymore or that they're constantly hurting me "  Clearly I'm still pretty bitter and need to get over that  It's like trying to remove all the eggshells to their side  and set boundaries to keep them off my side   I will admit once the holidays were over  I started to feel myself go back to that comfort zone  The zone where I think that I'm fine and I'm weak for wanting to get help  I can't let that sense of false security take over and your response reminded me of that  Clearly I'm still being hurt and controlled and need boundary building tools  Looks like Wednesday and Thursday I can finally go to one   Also thank you for sharing that quote  It helps reenforce that I'm in control now and I need to act like it   I'm with you  I've been sick as hell  cant sleep or keep any food down  Hopefully I'll be ok in a few days so I can get back into running   There's a post with literally the same heading    Concrete tips for staying away from porn  https   www reddit com r pornfree comments 2mfxyi concrete tips for staying away from porn     oh  and there's no such thing as slowly cutting porn    Had very similar symptoms  Went on for about 15 days  Better now  It does go away but don't hesitate to see your doc  That was my mistake waiting for help when I could have gotten it right away  Take care of yourself it gets better   That was what I was saying  how can it all be back to square one  Didn't want to argue more I read it  and I think you're a faggot   Thanks for the thoughtful post  man  I think you're very much on the right track sorry I am out  talked myself into thinking no fap meant porn viewing ok  not really will be back next month   I'm finding the same  It's almost a relief to not be drinking   I didn't realise how much of my time was taken up by thinking about it never mind drinking it   Glad to be here and glad you are here too    I would disperse mine in bins around town   sorry out be back next month Great post by xtinafreeze   I smoked 5 7 cigs a day so I went right to the 7mg patch  Some key points from my experience     Dreams are crazy  Sometimes downright psychedelic   I took my patch off at night and applied a fresh one after my morning shower    it took 15 min after reapplying the patch before cravings went away again     skin felt itchy under the patch   when applying  don't push the patch into your skin too hard  Just rub it gently starting from the four corners  I alternated shoulders     if you smoke a cig while on a patch  go ahead and throw away the rest of the patches and go back to smoking  Don't go for that "one" cigarette no matter what    After using my last patch  the cravings rushed back  but at a fraction of its strength  They were weak enough for me to manage  I'm in Day 8 without the patch now  Good luck    Oh and I recommend Nicoderm  I tried the Walgreen patches a year back and but didn't feel like they were transmitting the nicotine as well   Just crushed a perrier  Craving begone  I was a fan of the republic while it lasted   We've moved into the post truth era now where everyone gets their own facts   Stupid USA   Just pissed it all away  Yeah im 2 weeks in and im coughing up nasty shit  Now I know I can't go back because I don't wanna go through all of this again  Plus even coughing all this stuff up I still feel amazing   It's probably the same if you can find the right place  I don't doubt there's probably some scams out there  or some schools that don't have employers willing to hire from there  Just find the right place    No way I'd get stuck as a bar back for years with little hope anyone is gonna train me   Haha  I was thinking the same myself  I hoe through the stuff  Are you a pussy  faggot  or a pussy faggot        or both    Also  go fuck yourself and drink moar  We have all had a darkest moment  I feel   Thank you for sharing and giving me the courage to really think about some of my more vulnerable moments  These moments as dark as they are define us   It's our choice to break the cycle and I can say that I have and I'm a better man for it   SD has thought me many things and made me realize that there is a better way   Here's to not drinking with all of you  I appreciate the support  Unfortunately  I'm a drunk  And  I can't drink more  because drinking more is what I do  It's a non sequitur  I could OD on pills though  D i'm so glad i stumbled upon this  i want to stop drinking so badly but just don't know how  i'm one of those people who can't stop once they start  i've tried to use alcohol as a way to cope with my depression and anxiety but all it's done it make it much worse for me  the shame and intense anxiety i feel the day after i drink is destroying me  i'm ruining  my reputation  destroying relationships  and am spiraling out of control  i'm completely lost right now  i'm giving this a shot   COOOOL Just lie down  You will rethink your bullshit later on  mate    HEY  NO  you're not a bum  you're strong  and amazing  I envy you  You're inspirational  I'm brand new to reddit  so idk how it works  but I'm going to give you some gold for being not only strong enough to overcome this affliction  but for your selflessness and reaching out to strangers who you see are hurting  You deserve it  you're gonna change lives with your support   3  The one thing I'd ad to Doc's reply is that exercise stimulates your endocrine system  most notably  IMHO  the adrenal gland  which releases cortisol and aldosterone  which strengthen the body's response to inflammation  regulate the heart and blood pressure  and provide energy   And of course  Epinephrine  adrenaline  is released as well   Huge difference I've noticed exercising religiously during this quit versus the previous few   Edit   Just re read Doc's post and I see he did mention Norepinephrine  so nvm   But still  exercise is legitimately probably your greatest natural tool to help overcome detox PAWS  I actually wasn't joking about that  He was T Boned in an intersection  broke some discs in his back and was on opiates opiods for nearly half of his life and they killed him  He was also not "using "   And you don't need to pull out your degree  he was a JD as well     While I think its still a bit to broad I like the word "Drive" I really want to get the drive to write more and finally get a book done  I also want to have the drive to never sit down and always keep myself going  I know it can be tough  but my time on earth is limited and I want to make every moment of it  Thanks so much for your post and encouragement  I can relate to what you said  it's not even so much cravings I'm getting  more like random thoughts and reminders of my drinking days  And I think you're right  the fact that I'm still getting these thoughts is a sign that my drinking was a serious problem and a reminder of why I shouldn't go back  My heart goes out to you and your family HP   I have no doubt that your grandfather would be proud to see you reaching out to inspire us in your time of grieving   Thank you for this gift  You'd be right  I hadn't already taken it   Heyyyyyy Buddy   Nice to see you Cunt Punch   No problem man  sleep is super important for recovery  Yeah  I assume it's spam  and I don't think I'm mistaken  but it's possible  I tried to tell the guy his link was a sales site  so he had plenty opportunities to replace it with a neutral source  say Wikipedia  to state the most obvious   To pickle  or not to pickle  I think  The Donald is leaking  MODS    Worst feeling ever  having a dream you look at porn  going at it in dream  then waking up and binge relapsing Duuuuude  just the best show  I realized that October is long and it doesn't mean that we saw the same show  hahaha  It's true  there are a lot of things I'd be sacrifing if I drank again  better health  peace of mind  self respect  money  time  etc     Also  i totally didn't mean to disparage the moderation here or the sub in general  I was just concerned people recovering and trying to avoid drugs might fail to notice it links to a sales site  so I was a bit over dramatic   Yeah  I read through the post  was just wondering if anyone had any differing opinions or maybe someone that went through a particularly similar experience to mine had something more specific   Either way  I made the leap to delete all of the porn on my computer  It's sort of a big step  but I've done it multiple times before and always end up amassing a new collection  Aside from that  like another comment on this sub said  you can't really delete URLs from your memory so it's all just self control and will from here  I  just don't understand why you would fuck with Fentanyl  You don't have to   Well  then  go see the docs  Quicker than you know it   Show some self preservation  ya fuck   I'm on Day 8  I got this far by tracking my cravings with my iPhone Notes  Every time I have a craving  I write down the time and intensity  1 5 stars  and then enter a few words on how I feel  I also take ten deep and quick breaths until my lungs feel less compressed  I started exercising again and have been avoiding stressful situations and smoker friends  And finally  I let myself eat whatever the heck I want knowing that I'll lose it all now that I'm able to run again  Good luck all you quitters    Quitting is for winners     You're about as funny as Donald Trump   I have read it  about 6 months ago  It was good  though I did read it rather quickly and have since forgotten most of it  Perhaps a reread is in order    Drive is a dope word   You sound like my mother  Congratz   sign me up  check in Looks like it's just the first article about the hunger scale  When you click the image or "read more " you get sent to a "website coming soon" page   Yeah  I reported it  but only to moderators  I suppose might be good to report to reddit admins  also  I have not done that  I shouldn't have called on you to report it since I already reported it  but I'm newish here and unfamiliar with the moderation  so I was worried my report would go unheeded  based on poor experiences with other subs  Sorry bout that  mods  Yeah  thanks again  hope my call to action didn't call everyone to flood the moderation queue  It will be tough but you can do it   I will not drink with you  This is a really good 3 minute video that explains what systems in the brain alcohol effects   http   lundbeck com global brain disorders disease areas other diseases alcohol dependence  One of the areas that is affected is the PreFrontrol Cortex   This is the part of the brain that affects social control amongst other things    Under normal circustances  the PFC allows us to control urges to say or do things   Although we would find relief to talk about something  perhaps as a signal that we need help with something   we can decide not express those feelings as we don't want to trouble someone etc    With alcohol affecting the PFC  that ability to control that decision diminishes the more alcohol affects it   So  yes  you are correct in that whilst under the influence  the expressing of what was already in her brain was affected and so that is why she was expressing it more openly whilst drinking  Your mum has a lower pitch  Fuck off now  Congrats and looking forward to it   Wow Totally  I've noticed one of my personal biggest relapse triggers is boredom  and it really helps to remind myself just  how deeply boring  I am when I'm smoking weed    Another thing I've found helpful is writing down a description of myself as a person  as a stranger would  when I'm high  and then another when I'm sober   that high person I describe never sounds like someone that I'd want to even hang out with  never mind be  y'know   Ok is this some kind of horrendously boring trolling  I ask  because you previously said you had taken Fentanyl more than 100 times  and I know from life that taking Fentanyl more than 100 times means either you're an addict  your doctor is a complete fuck or you're lying  So which is it nurse Betty   Thank you    Sorry for your loss   I've lost a few friends to H as well   I'm going to give you some off the cuff advice   if 1 3g is your wall then you must jump from there   IMO it's probably your best route   If you're going to be in insufferable WD at 1g  why not just jump and start actually getting better   I jumped at about 5g 21 days ago and with exercise the acutes only lasted about 8 or 9  days   Mentally I feel I'm starting to get better  starting to see the proverbial light  but not there yet   Feeling confident about the future  though   I have full trust in the process   Best of luck in whatever you choose  naybe it's a blessing in diguise  If you don't take your dose for 3 days in a row  You have to start back at 30mg     Wednesday when the doctor is in  I'm going to begin to taper  Congrats  You make no sense  Go back to Autism  it actually accepts you   Here's what I did   1  Wrote a five part blog entry comprising thousands of words and posted it to Facebook one day at a time  2  Discovered that there were way more people like me  or people who knew people like me  in the world  and that almost all of them were supportive  3  Worried about my parents reading it  especially the parts about how I've had sex with other men while drunk  because they didn't know that about me  4  That turned out to be okay   All of that said  I'm not sure I would recommend this route for everybody  I found it cathartic  but your way sounds entirely reasonable  The one thing I would say is that if you just tell people  "Look  I thought I was drinking too much  I've decided to give it a rest for a while " most of them will be completely cool about it   Your path  of easing people into the idea    if it makes you feel less stressed out than being super public about quitting altogether  then I say go for it  The only way to get this stuff to work is to make it easy on yourself  My version of that is writing confessional blog posts  including when I relapse  as I did a few days ago   For other people  it's something else  Same here   Yes  but that's in combination with other things  Pale stool  itching  white nails  URQ discomfort  etc  I feel as if my liver is shit  but I've yet to experience the more serious symptoms   Don't keep track at all and there's nothing to reset  If  you're enjoying the time you abstain from porn then just enjoy it   I'm with you  I used weed to self medicate depression but it became too much of a crutch for me  I'm 29  by the way  and I wish I'd tried to quit when I was your age  You're smart for recognizing it's a problem and taking the steps to change    One thing I say to myself when I feel bad and want to smoke the feelings away is simply  "feel it"  Just a little reminder that my bad feelings are my self trying to tell me something  and that I should feel them  reflect  and take action instead of just masking the symptoms   On the more fun side  lucid dreaming is a positive goal I'm working on  as well as choosing a book I really want to read and committing to reading during the times I used to lay around stoned  Those goals in particular are helpful because they're things I love that weed hinders   Good luck and feel free to PM me if you want support from someone else who used to self medicate depression with weed  You got this  I don't know what to say   I've never had that gold thing sent my way   I had to look it up to see what it was   Thank you so very much   The truth is that I'm no different than you or anyone else here   As so many here have helped me  I try to reach out to others when I can   You helped me by sharing your truth and the struggles you face   There's something about what you wrote that makes me think you really can do this thing    I would love nothing more than to see you  and all the good folks at SD  find a better life free from alcohol   I will joyfully  and appreciatively  not drink with you today  Usually that time for me is a very dangerous time  I'm starting to feel myself again  good thing   but I start rationalizing that I'm no longer an addict and I can use again once or twice for old times' sake   Any time those thoughts come over me  I'd immediately fall back on 3 4 preset activities that will keep my mind off things for at least an hour or two  Whether it's the gym  playing an instrument  seeing a friend  or cooking   that really helped me   The good news is you're going to start feeling better over the next month or two  Every day will feel incrementally better  You're on your way  The Sinclair Method may or may not be for you  but it would certainly be worth you reading into  Here is a quick 5 minute read of what it is  then if you think you want to know more  there is a link included to do so   This is what eventually worked for me   http   patient info health sinclair method for alcohol use disorder  Alcohol Use Disorder is a spectrum that includes all types of drinking from mildly dependent to severely dependent  to binge drinking etc etc   There is absolutely no need for anyone to have to hit rock bottom any more   Maybe that used to be true before scientists learned what was happening in the brain when a mind altering substance is taken  but there is help available to anyone who wants to do something with their alcohol misuse  regardless of where they might currently be on the AUD spectrum  and no matter what their goals are   The sad fact is that a lot of people don't ask questions like you are  and so for those people they do move along that spectrum without getting the intervention they could use at an early enough stage for it to make a difference   AUD is one of the few conditions in which early intervention tends to be ignored because the vast majority do still believe that someone has to hit rock bottom before something will change   If someone feels a lump in their breast  are they ignored and told to leave it until it does become untreatable  or are they taught to seek help at the absolute earliest time available because finding an early solution is the best option   I also found this short 3 minute video useful   It helps to explain what is going on in the brain when alcohol is taken and why some of us just can't take it or leave it   When you understand what is actually happening 'up there' in the brain  it certainly makes it easier to understand what can be done to interrupt the process   http   lundbeck com global brain disorders disease areas other diseases alcohol dependence       Do this in a public library or coffee shop and don't MO that day  It's not a relapse  Otherwise you did relapse  Sobriety is as worthwhile as you put stock into it  Do you like feeling shitty  Or do you like feeling healthy  Clear skin or greasy gross skin  For me  not being sober simply isn't an option  I've made too many mistakes  I've hurt too many people  not to mention myself  It's whether you want it  The support is here   that's awesome  i was on the edge of my seat reading that  had i been in your shoes  i imagine it would end with me crying in a heap on the floor  I am impressed and inspired  thanks for posting  Thanks for sharing that  I was trying to

Lethargy eventually goes away  Try to do some excercise  it will also help you sleep   Yep  When I visited family  I would carry the empty wine bottles in my suitcase and dump them in the garbage can of the ladies' room at the train station  Pretty classy  This is such a great quote  Really resonated with me   150 days nice job  But care  like I said I start smoking again once after 7 months  just by smoking one cig  you cant just delete the fact you was once addicted  this will take maybe years to be fully recovered  even after a few months the brain is still set to nicotine thing  thats why u still have cravings  Do something else when u have cravings  make a tea  yoga  somethings which make you feel better  you need to replace that thing make you feel relaxed the cig  with another benefit activity  I don't know how your addiction level but for me it was a hell  I'm done with the cigs  forever and ever  It was fun when I was a kid  not going to school  buy cigs with the money for school food and stuffs but not anymore  there are others which crying for health and we because are young we are allowed to damage your health  F  k cigs and f  k this society which put in every store this crap to make people sick and others rich  Great program believe me you will get stronger than you will believe you can in a very short amount of time   My son after a month said dad you look awesome   Best program I have ever tried   I am 50 and I am lifting as much as I did in college   Also it serves as a great motivational tool to not drink the first beer  I have no idea if you did the right thing  But I am on here over an alcoholic spouse also and just wanted to say I am sorry your going through this and I get it  I have no idea what this Alanon thing thang is about yet  but if I poured all that out like you just did it wouldn't feel too good to not get any response  I hope you get some peace man  I really do  Maybe one day those late night scary as fuck phone calls will stop for all of us  Internet hug   Once a month ish   It's nice to meet you  u stistingtothesun  Gosh  I can't even count the times I relapsed just to finally realize that I couldn't moderate  Good on you for holding yourself accountable  These days  I have to hold myself accountable every single day  or I will slip up again  The daily check ins are so very important to me for that reason  Hell  sometimes I'll check in 4 times a day  Anything that helps     So welcome  it's great to have you here  You are in the right place   I just pictured magneto You would want to speak with a doctor about how to safely use antabuse   Yes  exactly  The progress doesn't gets lost  we continue from there   Just like in a game  if we die  we continue from a point instead of starting it all over  Definitely not  I understand why you would ask the question despite probably knowing deep down all along that you were totally right   it's thankless when you care about an active alcoholic and you will always receive the blame that they are unable to place on themselves because of their denial    I'm sorry that you had to go through that  You did the right thing   sign me up  I always wanted a badge like that you know  If a guy has stayed clean for a 365 days and has had a relapse and is next to a guy having 10 days counter  it MUST be known that this guy is much much higher up the ladder  Great job  Just don't fall for that "I'm free and in control now so one puff won't hurt" That one puff is the difference between free forever and right back into smokeville You can do it  Drink plenty of water  eat a bunch of carbs to give your body sugar  that's a large part of the cravings as I understand it  And go do something physical  give your body some endorphins   This made me teary eyed  thank you for posting this    Welcome  I am so glad you are here  I will not drink with you today    "Look  I thought I was drinking too much  I've decided to give it a rest for a while "   Thanks  I think that is a good idea to let them know I am serious about it  I genuinly enjoyed reading that entire paragraph  Thank you for sharing   Thanks  This community is really amazing and i'm so glad i found it   Thanks for posting this  I needed it tonight   Thank you  Still feeling better  Big sigh of relief   Day 6  Me too  I think I'm losing my mind  Keep posting  Keep reading     Congrats on 30 days    What have you done to beat porn  Don't say   everything  I really doubt that    coz the people who have done everything have had success  Really had success    I keep interviewing such successful people  We tend to take shortcuts everytime  Things concerning our will don't have shortcuts    so  you can't use the same yardstick to measure your failures  All set  Just getting ready now  Thank you  Eek    I'm going to try so hard   don't thank me  I've scrolled your profile and you've given so much support to everyone expecting nothing  Im sure the gold won't do much but I wanted to surprise you and thank you and hope you continue to help everyone on this sub  Thanks Jay  Happy new year  Me too  Fingers crossed    "  "  or the untitled short soundscapey track off the Devil and God fucking destroys me  I listened to it a lot when copping dope at the end of the summer  I literally sob like a child if I hear it  It just brings me to a time where I wasn't where I should have been  where I chose dope over the most important thing in the world  I don't know why it crawled into my head the way it has  but it's there and it's always brutal  Thanks for reminding about that  It's really powerful  I wanted to write something about that to envision   but was procrastinating  You would make a great coach  I guess  that's exactly what the OP needs to do  Thanks for all your replies  i haven't slept much at all maybe 3 5 hours  Not withdrawal related just have a poorly baby   Dreading going to work  again not because of wd just because i work in construction outside  i am tired and its freezing out    You are all correct when you say it is mostly a mental battle on such a low dose  This needs to be kept in the day for sure  I know all too well what can happen a few weeks in when the mind starts to bullshit and all that 'just one dose' 'you've earned it' crap comes back into play   I know i was only on a small amount to some but my overall health and appearance has definitely suffered with daily use for around 2 5 years  I look pale  grey almost  thin in the face despite a healthy appetite  My digestion is bad  I am relatively young and fit but feel sooo weak and going on 65 instead of 35  My joints ache  my brain is foggy  i can't get up in the mornings  no enthusiasm or drive whatsoever   Something that began working so well has robbed me of any natural endorphins or good feeling  I really do feel zombified and enslaved even on around 8g a day   Personally i think it is due to the stimulant type effects and what with recent stresses in my life and a nasty virus i would put it down to adrenal fatigue that i could never fully recover from whilst using   Anyway  for something i played down as pretty harmless it seems to be a tough old battle for some people so i shan't underestimate my opponent  despite being a heroin addict for 15 years  Yes this is very mild in comparison however that seems to play into the mindset that 'a small spoon wont hurt'   I wish anyone on this journey the strength and courage to get off the powdery green wurlitzer   If I can be of any help to anyone else I will   Have a good day all  Peace  Thanks man  Good luck to you too  We can do this  Good God    Why haven't you just taken a "little extra" Fentanyl then  What are you fighting for  I'm completely serious  because I'm not fighting for anything     it's a genuine question     I don't have the regret  because it's a pointless thing to hold onto  By "having the regret" and just thinking about "all that wasted time" you are wasting ACTUAL TIME RIGHT NOW IN THIS FUCKING MOMENT   Damn    this needs to be framed  3rd of Jan   3rd day  All good  You can do it  I was in denial about being an alcoholic until I tried to stop drinking  Normal drinkers just do not think obsessively like I  we  do    I blew it over Christmas  new year but before that the month I had under my belt where the best days I had in 17 years  The first two weeks are the hardest  The headaches are part of the process I believe  I have them too  I just ate a crap load of whatever I wanted and drank a lot of fluids  You've got this  we are here     I will not drink today  Sounds reasonable I personally needed every last drink and every last fuck up to finally get the message  Otherwise I might still be riding that shit show train  That's the good news though  we fucked shit up so that we have the motivation and the insight to truly rebuild better versions of ourselves  I will not drink with you today   you answered your own question  you need to go to a meeting and get involved in the fellowship and also get a sponsor work the steps if you want to truly live a free and healthy life   If you're a true addict going it alone only lasts so long  Yep     been there   I mean  slight twist to my story  but same general idea   I've gotten drunk and proceeded to go into a friend's medicine cabinet looking for sleeping pills and or painkillers   And found them  and stolen them  Because drunken me has no morals    I once lived with a dude who was like     23  give or take a year  I kinda grew up around him but dude was not all there  and I felt bad because he never got diagnosed for his disability and was kinda just struggling through life while homeless    He at one point decided that this one cat in the trailer park reminded him of an ex  she used to have a cat  that was the connection   He broke the bottom of our door so the cat could come and go freely  Raccoons got into the house as well as multiple stray feral cats  One feral cat had kittens under my bed and was super protective and wouldn't come out  THAT was fun    Regularly had to go drag him in from outside  He loved to drink but somehow 6 beers meant taking his shirt off and passing out outside  I think he wasn't actually that drunk  he just wanted to go outside without a shirt on    Which  he was creepy like that  He once vandalized his own truck with spray paint to make it look like his ex still wanted him  We all knew he did it because the words were misspelled  he couldn't read  and his ex was living across the country    But I think he liked going outside without a shirt on and making it look like his ex still desired him to impress the girls that lived next to us  He had crushes on them and that's when I started distancing myself  They were 13 and 16 years old    He did eventually bang the 16 year old   and I'm 99  sure he banged the 13 year old  He did at one point possess nude photos of her     Fucking weird shit    I used to just feel bad for him because he was retarded but I learned he's really a vile manipulative fuck  He knew the landlords so I just gave him money to give them for rent  he never paid rent  he just pocketed the money  He also stole regularly and if you caught him he'd start cutting himself  Once I woke up during a night of partying and he was trying to rape a 15 year old girl who he THOUGHT was just so drunk she was passed out  She woke up while he was in his boxers and undressing her and beat his ass      He told me when he has sex he intentionally cums inside girls without giving them a warning because "he's ready to be a father"     He doesn't go after normal girls  just underage girls and other people with disabilities  Last I heard a few years back he was dating a deformed person with a learning  disability also   I know he only goes for these people because they're easiest to manipulate  Stahp  I can only get so hard     I've relapsed twice  This is my "third time lucky" but I've felt a shift this time  I felt so proud of my 30 days and then so rubbish after drinking  I much prefer the proud sober me  Once I pushed through the first two weeks it got easier in some ways but also harder as my addicted brain convinced me that since I could do a month  I clearly didn't have a problem  This time I'm not listening to the beast  I'm starving that evil voice of its food until it dies  You can do this  We are here for you   And you're about as smart    Trolliolololol I've been blacked out behind the wheel before  Very scary and filled with shame the next day  Avoiding car accidents or worse is a huge motivation for me  Congrats on 15 days  I will not drink with you today   I abandoned mindlessly browsing around  So yes  As soon as I finish the exams I will also delete my Facebook account "hastag muh kagguh"  Hahahaha  I love this  For those of you just starting out  and for those of you who just discovered SD  This place is so full of support and resources  The stories I read here are healing  The wisdom I find here helps me stay sober  Welcome  This was excellent   Congratulations  Sign me up I didn't go to the gym for two months after getting sober because I was so bummed out by what I had done to myself  Now I'm back in the swing of it and feel amazing  It takes 1 4 of the time to see results    My trick  I make myself go  telling myself just to  go  even if I just lay on a mat for the entire time  The crazy thing is that the days when I'm feeling laziest are the days when I end up pushing myself the hardest  Seriously  just getting myself there is usually enough  And if I don't have a great workout  So what  At least I went and don't want to ruin even those results with calorie filled  lazy making alcohol   Oh and My Fitness Pal  It's kinda awesome tracking and charting everything      The free version is enough for me    I by no means am trying to "one up you" or anything  I know this isn't a competition  I just hope my story can help   January 24  2014  I drove 12 miles black out drunk into oncoming traffic and crashed my vehicle head on into a young woman driving home from work  Her pelvis was crushed and she was air lifted to a nearby hospital where she laid in a coma for  3 months   For 3 months I worried and worried and worried    and continued to drink  I was worried she wouldn't wake up  how many years would I get etc etc  I was worried about myself and myself alone  When she woke up I cried tears of joy  Half of them were from the decent person inside me  the scared  lost boy who had been away for a long time  letting alcohol manage his life  He cried because he cared  The rest of the tears were from the drunken man who had buried the boy away long long ago  He cried tears of joy because he wasn't going to get a life sentence and could keep drinking   She has permanent brain damage  It's been a long time  I am on probation now  part of the terms is I am not allowed any communication what so ever  I have no idea how she is doing now  I can only pray for the best   After prison  rehabilitation  therapy and sobriety I woke up  The real me surfaced and I writhed in pain and sadness at all of the things I had done  not just to this young woman  but to my friends and family and loved ones over the years  All the hurt  suffering  anger that I had caused    Alcohol stopped me from being the person I always intended to be  It turned me into a monster  I was disgusted  stressed  scared  shocked  I felt foul and weak and my whole body burned with shame   When I was in prison  I asked my counselor how I could ever be forgiven  The answer  I found  was that I had to forgive myself first  That was the first step  It seemed impossible  I hated myself all these years after all  and even more so then  I am slowly learning how to love myself  and with acceptance comes forgiveness  In AA we are asked to suspend our previous notions about "God" and spirituality  We are asked that if we believed a higher power  one that is all loving and all caring  could we believe that our higher power forgave us  I found a concept of a higher power that I could understand  I could believe my higher power loved and cared for me  I could believe my higher power was forgiving and forgave me and all my faults and flaws  I started to believe that I could forgive myself   I have no illusion of control over others today  The only thing I can do is clean my side of the street and ask for forgiveness  The people I hurt may not be ready to forgive me  nor may they ever have any intention to  I have done my part  or am doing my best to do so  and in return can expect nothing from no one else but I can expect my own love and forgiveness   I drank because I hated myself  I drank because I thought I was different  I drank because alcohol enabled me to believe I was special  That no one hurt like I did  No one loved or feared like I did  No one had profound thoughts like I did  Alcohol let me pretend to be my own God  The world revolved around me  My life was a movie and I was the star  The thing about starts is there are billions of them  They are all beautiful in their own way but none are unique  I am in orbit with everyone else now  I know my place  I fit  I'm no longer a needle in the hay  The boy inside isn't lost anymore  He's trying to pick up the pieces of his past and put together a better future for himself  The boy is me now  There is no mask  no inner God  I have no power  I simply am  And I have people that love me  I love me or at least I don't hate me  I'm am still growing   I forgive myself   Anyway  I hope this helps  I hope you can find forgiveness from others but most importantly within yourself  The best thing you can do is stop drinking  Think about the person you want to be  Think about how you treat others  Do you do these things when drinking  If the answer is no  I recommend sobriety  Drugs and alcohol change your state of mind  They dampen your inner self  not enhance it  At least this is my opinion   Good luck   Look up freeletics  not easy but the coach really helps  They have one simple rule  finish what you start regardless of how long it takes   Sign me up  Toothpicks  Like the cinnamon flavored ones  They helped me when I was sitting in traffic feeling ragey and nix fitting   Yes  I have that so often when I'm clean  This helps so much  Actually  I sometimes have that and then I'm partly convinced that I've relapsed  and only later into the day I realize that it was a dream  Yes  best feeling ever  Welcome back  So glad to have you   With  Librium I just take that shit as needed  I guess it's really just there to help prevent seizures more than anything   But apparently the dose to prevent a seizure and the dose to combat the fear are very different doses haha   Good for you  Day 8 seems a long way away the more I read about everyone's achievements the stronger I feel  Welcome back   Probably not gonna pass  You might but I'm skinny as shit and even if I rarely smoke herb it stays in my system for a fair while  like two weeks or so   You should just hit up a buddy for some clean piss    That's crazy they're gonna drug test you though for having a seizure  So they already know about the booze thing  That seems like a really invasive approach just because of a seizure  Yup  its not about ladder  its about indicating our good days and our bad  One should always remember their good time too and this will help in that  Thanks for the support  Taping a small container of clean piss to the inside of your upper thigh should be fine  I've done it lots of times and never come close to being caught  Unless it came untaped and fell in front of them I don't see how you could get caught    That or you fuck the temperatures up  But you can buy a basic thermometer and microwave it bit by bit until it's right temp and then tape it to you and it will maintain the correct temperature  Yep  irritability is common in early sobriety    Mod here  if you find something that you feel is against the rules and guidelines of the sub  please take the time to hit the report button and let us know  We can't catch everything     Check out the guidelines here     https   www reddit com r stopdrinking wiki index  I absolutely love this comment  All the comments here are great  I have been slamming tea for the last two months  Sometimes the act of drinking anything  other than alcohol  is what I need   So glad to have you  I will not drink with you today   This is exactly how i felt a couple weeks in   for us long term smokers maybe it just takes a little longer one can hope   There has to be a light at the end of tunnel my friend Congrats  that's amazing  We try not to give direct advice on SD  We encourage people to speak from their own experience and share what worked for them  Did these things help you early on as well   Have you tried taking your mom or dad to a meeting  Or taking some AlAnon literature to them     Deleting your stash is certainly a great  step  I remember feeling anxious thinking about it  but a lot better 5 minutes after I deleted it  Weird how deleting a couple of pixels can cause anxiety    Hope you're doing well     I think it's entirely possible for you to do it  If checking in works  keep it up  I was a wreck at a week sober  I wanted to drink all the things  but kept coming back to SD to read posts when I had urges  and they always passed  I read posts till I fell asleep at night  during the day  any time I needed to take my mind off things for a little bit     Why is this not top response   It may be wrong  but it seems more legit than the other two tops  I am right there with you  My method is to always have some sort of beverage in my hand  People don't even notice or care  I just head straight to the bar and order soda with lime  Private events with friends at someone's house are different  but the same method applies  Hold a drink in my hand and mimic the other people at the party and I feel so much better  Sure  you might feel a little awkward at first but the more times you do it the easier it gets  Anyway  people that would pass judgement or look down on you for bettering yourself and making a healthy decision are small and should not affect your self esteem  Congrats on 18 and 22 days  That is evidence that you have it in you to make it 24 hours and that is all it takes     I will hold a sparkling water with you today     You have to tell him  If he's been through recovery then he's in a great place to help you   I love it when I woke up   u KingenTheOne   also  the great thing about therapy is it's one on one  You can be introverted  because it's just you and one other person  And it's not all day   it's about an hour   I find therapy immensely useful  my mother is an narcissist and an alcoholic and likely bipolar  and even at 30 I have trouble sorting out which things are typical "mom" stuff and which things are totally overstepping boundaries  I understand when you say you're unsure how it will feel to you  but there's only one way to find out      As for the other question of other ways to stop worrying about your mom       that's called being a parentified child  just so you have a term to look up for yourself   You say you're introverted and I can definitely relate  Do you have creative outlets  such as art  music  or writing  I love sitting in a public place with headphones on  even if nothing's playing  just so nobody's tempted to come speak to me   and observing what's going on around me  and writing it down  And I find that's useful when I'm in an explosive situation  oddly  When a drunken family member is being belligerent in my direction  I find myself disassociating in ways such as noticing the tree that I put tinsel on three days ago       and that helps me keep my composure during the onslaught  until I can get away from it   Still  I will take the contents of the onslaught to my therapist    Edit  and I  too  am sorry you're being confronted with this at such a young age  Can relate  this was my 'cunning plan' too  Sometimes  even at a kids playground when there were no kids around  to my eternal shame   My last lot recently found are actually in our household recycle bin right now  waiting to be emptied tomorrow  not hidden  and it feels great  as will getting my 365 badge Jan 1 2018   Best of luck to you on the journey   The other night  my BF and I got into our first fight   super stupid reason  I'd been really dropping my dose down quickly  so mentally I was kinda edgy  I literally never am physically violent with anyone  Never hit my kids EVER  I got so angry at my BF that I completely blew up  I was gonna leave and he stood in front of me  I hit him  pushed him  ripped my cloth bag and threw all my stuff at him  tried to push him down the stairs  screamed every horrible thing I could think of  It was truly awful  and that's not like me AT ALL  Then today  my daughter was being totally unreasonable and bitchy   pretty normal for a 14 year old  Again  totally lost it  Thank god I walked away and locked my door  I was sooo angry  then I was bawling and hugging her     Kratom is uniquely able to screw with my head  I'm gonna have to be extremely cognizant of that and not take out my emotions on the people I care about the most  They don't even know about the Kratom    That seems very legit He did  He also called me an idiot because I said he couldn't call people idiots for not doing Kraton   sp   And that he couldn't link to selling stuff  Such is life Wonderful  So glad to see you are having fun with sobriety     This is the way to really live life  Thanks for sharing    Good luck on your first day  Yay  So proud of you    It happens  now you want to succeed even more so it's a win too I don't even have an answer  because I feel this way about somebody who used to be in my life  as well  I'm just here commenting in solidarity  I have 11 days right now and yes they have helped me personally immensely  This was the first New Years Eve in 25 years that I didn't have a drop  Hahaha  Me too though  I had a sales job and I used Kratom to outperform everyone  My monthly bonus checks were  4 6K   on top of my base pay  I made a ton  Guess how much I have now   like maybe  400  Lol I spent it all on Kratom or other dumb stuff  Plus I acted so weird and inappropriate and unlike I've ever acted or hope to act again that I ended up getting fired  even tho I was a top performer  What a winner  huh  All for the love of the ground up tree leaf   Every time that son of a bitch that lives in my head tells me "hey you've made it this far  you're not that bad  have a drink" I come and read the newcomers posts and I see myself in all of them  It is a reminder to me of how far I've come and how far I could fall   I have been worrying about not drinking at my wedding     Then I remember I probably won't have one being a drunk    No way would I be be able to lunch in a pub and have an open bottle of wine around right now  Those seem like a lot of triggers to be surrounded by   Listen  I was endlessly in love with a heroin addict  The way I broke the spell was admittedly not recommended  I had his Facebook password    and for two weeks  any time I saw he was logged on  I logged in and watched his activity  I watched his conversations  and took screen shots of every underhanded move he made   It really opened my eyes to the "scumbag" he was when he thought nobody was looking  and I've never wanted to go back  When I sometimes miss our amazing long term friendship  I don't even have to open the screen shots  just knowing what I'll find if I do is enough   And I'm very sorry for what you're going through  I remember  to a T  the stress  I remember being as scared of what would happen if he  did  get a job as if he didn't  I remember wanting to message him every seven minutes  and feeling like it was a victory if I somehow went 32 minutes without either thinking about it or doing it  I remember everything  I wouldn't wish it on anybody  and yet others are still going through it every day  Thanks for writing all this out  Very helpful stuff  It feels like you're still in mental withdrawals because you ARE still in mental withdrawals  we usually call it PAWS  or Post Acute Withdrawal Syndrome   PAWS is a leading cause of relapse   Insomnia  depression  difficulty handling emotions  trouble thinking  feeling lethargic  these are all symptoms of PAWS   I know it feels shitty  that those words don't even start to do justice to how you feel  but the good news is that you can't trust your emotional outlook right now  the world really isn't as hopeless as it feels I promise   It also gets better   It takes time  PAWS can last for months depending on length and severity of use  but it usually peaks at its worse pretty quickly and gets better and better from there   And you can help it get better  Part of PAWs is your brains healing process  it is trying desperately to get back to homeostasis after being severely fucked with  your reward system has been competent jacked by using   Healthy eating  hydration  exercise  these all help your brain heal  give it the building blocks it needs and kickstart your normal endorphin release   A healthy sleep schedule  mindfulness and or meditation  taking time for yourself to just relax and let pressure and stress roll over you  these can all make a huge difference in your emotional and mental well being   Something you said  or rather didn't say  stuck out to me   You say clean a couple times but you never say recovery   Staying clean is only half the battle  to make it stick you need recovery   Are you going to meetings   Engaged in the recovery community   Do you have a sponsor or someone to be accountable to   Have you changed the people  places and things that lead to using   Do you have a therapist or someone to confide in   Are you working the steps   Going it alone makes staying sober so much harder than it needs to be   There are a bunch of people that would love to help  that have experienced all this before  that know what you are going through and can see the signs of impending relapse before you will and help you break the cycle   At the very least you should talk to a professional about the thoughts you have and be honest with them that you just quit using and are experiencing PAWS   Right now there's no way to know if this is a result of using or not  your brain just hasn't had a chance to heal  after PAWS it may all go away  but a therapist or addiction expert can help you make that determination   You can do this  this is unfortunately what we addicts get to deal with after we've fucked with our brains so much  but if you take action you can make it go by faster and be easier to deal with  and your chances of long term success go way up   You got this  good luck  Committed to complete 90 day detox with zero games  zero streams  unsubscribe from game specific and related subs and sited  Uninstalled all games from all devices  even removed hardware from PC to further inhibit gaming    37 year old gamer  Been playing since I was a young kid  NES was my gateway drug  My Atari Lynx was my favorite childhood possession and one of few things I still have from that age     Father and sole provider for family of seven  five kids me and the wife  three dogs  two cats  couple of parakeets and a fish tank   Over the past few years I have worked from home  That coupled with a lot of marriage and financial problems caused me to allow myself to go from a few hours a week to 8  hours a day on various games    They have become my escape  The comfort I would find when things were rough  Another factor in an already divided home  I used the excuse that my kids and I bought nod over games  but really that's weak and there are many ways for us to bond better    I stopped on the 1st  read posts here as well as info other places  I want to improve my work performance  I want to regain time lost and apply it to doing more with my kids    I want to break the cycle of escaping to games  I want to once again find pleasure in the other activities I used to engage in  I want to become healthier  I want to be a fully realized version of what I once was    I hope after 90 days to reevaluate my progress and push further  but even today I had a hard time not just installing a mobile game to my phone when things were a bit icky  At first I thought okay 90 day detox  no problem  After today I realized how hard the 90 days will be  I will fight my way to 90  then hopefully to summer vacation  around 165ish  and then go from there   Your brain is rewriting man  you will adjust in time  Stick with it  and best of luck  Well done  I've "lost" many hours here reading  but every single one of those has been sober  SD is such a valuable tool  I had to look up what DBT was    Sounds interesting   I'd try it   I've been reading a lot of sobriety brain books and I like what they say  I'd give it a shot    If you want to quit drinking you should try r stopdrinking You are a professional  I went to my first meeting tonight  I also want to try not drinking for a year  Thanks for sharing   Can I make a recommendation  Yoga  at least one class with a number of hip centric poses  We hold a lot of emotion in our hips  I've found myself working through a lot of grief in the middle of a pigeon pose  I didn't think I was an "alcoholic" either until I tried to take a week off and struggled  I can say that in my experience  the cravings get easier to manage and pop up less often  They are still there but you get better at understanding what you're feeling and trusting that it will pass and you'll be happy you resisted   You are off to a good start  you got this  I will not drink with you today   Thank you very much  I am in early stage of new found sobriety  read your post twice  and found it to be helpful and insightful  I even saved a few passages in my journal  Congrats on your 1 year  Good luck   Thanks  I'll try and stick to it   Shit comments like this is a total cancer  If someone is coming  here for advice or otherwise  you should treat them seriously  and give them respectable advice  Sign me up Hey man I relapsed yesterday  We can do this though  create a lifestyle that doesn't allow stim use  Find more reasons not to use then excuses to get high  Thank you for the smile   And congratulations on your sobriety    Welcome back     Yep      Close the laptop unless you are doing something  not looking for something to do    Get out of your own head    Learn something new   Be accountable    If you fall down  get back up and do better next time   Live your life  Not today  Don't buy zzzquil  it's just overpriced benadryl and alcohol  Buy generic Benadryl for allergies to get the same medicine at a fraction of the cost   Welcome  This is going to be an important and monumental change for you   in a very positive way  We are here to support you  Cry much  Good luck  I know you'll smash it   Let us know how it goes  In interested in how you do with melatonin  Been thinkin about it for years   You are welcome here  SD has been one of the most helpful means of support during my recovery  I've found myself sitting in a bar and battling addiction with this subreddit open on my phone looking for a place to say anything about what I'm feeling  Seriously impressive self mastery  on 11 days no less  huge pat on the back   2 months is amazing  I can definitely empathize with your feeling of not quite knowing what to do with yourself when you aren't smoking  but it sounds like you haven't quite replaced your "stoner life" with new hobbies and activities for yourself yet  I've found one of the easiest ways for me to stay sober is to fill my life with lots of things that I can't do while I'm high   things that actually turn out to be much more engaging and rewarding than the things I could have done while smoking  not surprisingly    I don't know if you're an animal person  but I think dogs are a useful metaphor   if you have a smart dog and you lock it up inside with just a few toys to play with all day  it'll go crazy and wreck your house  or watch the world burn  as you put it   But if you train it  teach it  play with it  and push it outside of its comfort zone into learning new things  you have A  a much happier dog and B  all the destructive impulses it had when it was bored disappear because it's fully engaged in all the new development it's going through  I don't think we're really all that different  and I'd rather be the second kind of pup  wouldn't you   Anyway  congratulations on the two months  You've nailed what has been happening to me  and my body  I am on day one but hadn't considered my symptoms were pancreatitis  That's actually scary and motivating  Thank you  Good Luck  Hope you have a great day  xx My nosy neighbor who  when walking her dog  would always seem to stop outside my house on trash days  I'd swear she was counting the wine bottles in the recycling bin   Then again  maybe I was paranoid and her dog just needed to stop   I did the exact same thing 6 months ago on my 2 year anniversary   Couldn't figure it out  The angst passed as I'm sure yours will  Congratulations on 5 years  Keep moving forward  Good job  Keep hanging out with friends  but hang out with the sober ones  If you don't have one  hang out with family   Thank you   I am currently chewing on a chopstick and drinking tea to combat the urge to smoke   It's not so much that I want the smoke    it's all the reinforcing behaviors around smoking   So deep breaths and right now I am not smoking   Thanks  So sorry about your grandfather  and thank you for posting   it's important to hear that difficult times can  should  be managed without reverting to old ways   Take care  we're thinking of you x sign me up please  If he only gave up drinking for you  then he is not addressing the root of the issue  Does he go to counseling  or is he "white knuckling" it  Based on the displacement of anger  I'm assuming the latter   There are a lot of ways I  and so many people  could suggest helping him  or helping him to help himself  but that doesn't address the other key point  here  a relapse is nobody else's fault  You are not responsible for his sobriety  In fact  you  cannot be  responsible for his sobriety  If you're already walking on eggshells to "keep" him sober  he may as well not be as far as the relationship is concerned  This is our house favorite too   Go Billy     Doing all the things  yay   Well done  and please keep posting your progress  it helps me as well as you  Its a vocation  not merely a full time job  It's crazy to think that as I was reading yor post I kept thinking damn  this guy has smoked a looong time  Then I started doing the math  I'm almost 30 myself and also started in my teens   I've been doing the exact same shit as you except for 10 years rather than 15  Holy crap    We've been at this so long man  I felt you when you said the line between high and sober is blurred now  I feel almost like an opiate user  using to get to "baseline" rather than get high  I hate that I'm more creative and chill when high  It's affected us so much that it's become a part of our identity    Time to extricate ourselves from this identity   Hi and welcome    If I were you I'd forget about what happens after the snow clears  Today you're not drinking  and that's good   right    Tomorrow I hope you'll come back and check in and not drink with us some more  but today I'm not drinking with you   There's a whole load of helpful information in the sidebar  and a lot of wiser people than me around here if you need to do some more reading or talking   Best wishes  From my experience  and I was a very heavy smoker at times too   this will get so much better after five days   so I know it's terrible now  but if you can power through it  it'll be over very soon   Things I found that helped me physically  in no particular order    Working out  you've got this down it sounds like  though I found long walks   like 2  hours   helped me more than intense lifting     Valerian root  for sleeping  and ginger tea  for lack of hunger stomach upset  pretty much constantly   you can't OD on herbal tea and it has the added benefit of soothing your stomach and keeping you constantly hydrated  as well as the herbal benefits  Stack it up with honey and see if you can keep that down   at least it will get some sugar into your bloodstream     When you can keep food down  stick to fresh vegetables  steamed  and meat that is super low in fat content  I'd try to avoid beef  sausage and really any pork for the next week or so    raw vegetables were actually really easy for me to handle too  like lightly salted celery and cucumbers   but not everyone loves them  Also highly recommend steel cut oatmeal but I wouldn't necessarily try milk in it until your stomach is feeling a bit better     Hot baths steam baths   I am dubious of other folks who have claimed this helps you to detox but when you're feeling as shitty as you're feeling anything you can do to give yourself a moment of physical comfort is going to help   Good luck  What you're doing is so difficult  but on the plus side  this could be the last time you ever have to feel this way   so in a way you're doing your future self a huge  huge solid     You could start off with a DBT skills workbook  I haven't used any but there are a ton on Amazon   Pretty sure I'm the crazy roommate  I'm pretty normal and well centered where I'm living now but I would disappear for weeks on end and not tell past roommates where I was  Often if just end up passing out downtown for a couple weeks  Stupid as I was paying rent     Thanks for your input  Yeah I have been seeing a drug councilor ever since I got out of detox  That's been ok  Meetings are too heavy for me right now  Everyone knows everyone and every meeting I have gone to there has always been someone who was there the week before who OD'd and it's a little much to handle  I'm on a wait list for a psychiatrist but that's months away  same with a spot for rehab  Even when you're ready to stop and start your life over again they don't make it easy to get the help right when you need it most  I mean I have no idea where I will be by the time someone can see me    Thank you  I needed this   I start school tomorrow and I've been feeling pretty anxious about it  I'm 20 days clean and have been having a pretty rough time the last few days   I'm going to figure out how to keep myself busy throughout the day tomorrow  Maybe I'll pick up my guitar for the first time in a few months  I hate it too man  After my last relapse I got really angry with porn  How could we be so blind  How couldn't we see what it did to us continued watching porn  It literally was ruining our lives and we were allowing that  After 18 days  I am still angry against porn  Wanna be done quick  Cold turkey  The faster you are done with all of this   Awesome tips man  I can't tell you how much I appreciate your thorough comment  I'm gonna get right on to the chinese herbal place to get some of that valerian root and ginger for tea  I admit I've been trying to eat some take out food that's probably way too greasy  I'll give some veggies a go  It's funny because when I start to feel sick  I can almost feel the grease oil rise up to my gorge    Also about the hot baths  those definitely do help  I was similarly skeptical in the past and did some research and academics found that it is overwhelmingly reported to help in hyperemesis symptoms  even though they couldn't figure out exactly why    Many thanks friend I've gone to the ER for drinking mouthwash  It sucks  Pretty embarrassing   I can totally empathize with this   right after I've gone through the "worst" part of the quit and am feeling physically stable again is when I'm most likely to relapse because the shitty parts are no longer fresh in my mind and I can romanticize using again  I think a lot of the others on this sub have gone through the same exact thing   To me I sometimes think about the "early" quit as less like an accomplishment in its own right and more like getting out of prison after a long stay  It's not the thing that turns your life around   it's the thing that allows you to even  have  a life to turn around    I bet if you think about it you'll realize that there are now so many more kinds of things you can do  so many more lives you can live  now that you're no longer locked in the prison that weed addiction makes your mind  All that you have to do now is pick one and go after it   but you'll never be able to do that if you walk back inside  You know what it looks like in there  and it's never going to look any different than it did when you were in there before  But there's a whole world of possibilities out where you're standing right now   and you're finally free to go explore them  Wow  I have been going through many of the same things with my alcoholic wife that you are  The last 1 5 years have been littered with multiple detoxes  inpatient stays  psych stays  and police interactions  It has been brutal  I applaud you for your strength  Stay strong  my brother  I am pulling for you  When you wake up  write a list of all things you feel like doing  Then classify them as things you can get done very quickly  or things you can start in small steps so they eventually get done  Then juggle like 2 or 3 short term things with 1 long term things  and keep yourself busy  Spend part of your day on short term thing one  and maybe try to finish it and then start thing two but then check on long term thing 1 and make sure you get started on it the next day   It is absolutely pertinent you stay busy during this critical period   I wouldn't tell anyone at work that I have a drinking problem  Unfortunately there are a lot of stigmas against people with drinking problems alcoholics and I'd rather not make my private life part of the workplace rumor mill  This has nothing to do with feeling ashamed about who I am  it is simply that I do not care to create potential trouble for myself when there is no need to do so  The plan you outlined sounds fine for now  I think if you focus on staying sober one day at a time  this stuff will work itself out after your child is born  You don't need to decide now what to say in six months time  Good luck   Of course  It sounds like you're determined and planning and that puts you way ahead of the game in my book  Definitely stay away from the greasy foods though     Those are the absolute worst thing  really anything with heavy oil or fat content  or rich dairy  is going to make your stomach hate you   So true   Day 2 for me as well   I went to a bar in order to keep my routine minus the alcohol and see what would happen   Ordered two plain sparkling waters with lime squeezed in   It felt great and was way cheaper  which show is OA   good luck  I'm in a similar boat started at 14 I'm 33 now with a few small breaks which would lead back into casual smoking then back to wake and bake perma stoned  I'm on day 2 of quitting  Stay strong  I can relate all too well and am going through something similar with weed right now  I was a Psychology major in college and thoroughly concluded that marijuana did not have long term negative side effects  I have since spent the last 5 years disproving this to myself and after finally admitting the depression  lack of motivation  and array of other related issues  have finally concluded that my life is better without it  I am not my friends who can seemingly smoke day in and day out without serious life consequences  Only recently has it gotten so bad that it was easier to quit than to keep smoking  I can't preach like I've figured it out but some honest self reflection and keeping busy working towards my dream career has gone a long ways in helping me not smoke recently  If you're like me  you're capable of way more than what you are doing right now and it might take some more commitments to make yourself more productive and also make it easier to smoke less  Thanks for sharing  I wish you all the best  I find he daily check in helps too    Fridays are really bad for me too  this week I am going to go for a drive at 5pm to keep myself busy and distracted   what's making you feel odd   is there a triggering event  is it the big anniversary   I'm pulling for you  You can do it    If you can find a private server that will let you get to max level and max skills  etc  in less than an hour  play there  Have a bit of fun  then try and work out how much effort it would have taken you to get to this stage and ask yourself if that was really worth it   This was how I never played Maplestory  Mapleroyals  again and I can never go back to grinding on that dumb game now  but unfortunately I had other games I had difficulty with  Sign me up      I am done with this  12mg to 6mg will take about a day or two to get used to  but realistically it's all a walk in the park compared to cold turkey off cigs  When I went from 1 5 to 0mg  I never once thought "omg I need a cigarette nicotine juice"  I just felt a little emotionally unhinged for a week haha  But I tried to go cold turkey off cigs for many years with no success  I always had massive craves especially under stress  I never made it past a few weeks  I don't think I'd be able to resist smoking if I was still smoking IYKWIM   Sign me up please  Sober you seems like someone I'd like to hang out with    Great post  and great work  you should be really proud of yourself  and you should know how inspiring you are   Please keep posting  your life sounds brilliant and I love the way you write  Well        shit   Hey  It's so hard but you really can do it  I swear to god you can do it  Please be brave  Judy tough it out and soon it won't be so hard anymore  You've got this   Start stopping by continually starting at stopping     Every time you have a temptation  start stopping again   Every time you take a drink and regret it  dump the bottle and start stopping   Every time you think life is too heavy and alcohol will help  start stopping and change your thoughts on to running and doing something else     Do not accept failure once you recognize it  that's the exact moment you start stopping and slowly you just get better at starting more and more and more    I found a lot of people who understood what I was going through at group meetings and I helped myself in different ways by going to therapy  Have you considered either of those  I completely know how you feel  Making it three days is pretty amazing  especially if you're feeling a lot of anxiety and depression   I suffer from those two as well and I've found that with a few weeks of sobriety under my belt it becomes  super  clear to me that weed makes my symptoms much worse and more constant  As counter intuitive as it feels right now  you are helping your brain   which is trying to fight for itself   by not dragging it down with a substance that inhibits its ability to produce serotonin   I know getting rid of the glass is going to be really tough to do  especially if you're emotionally attached to it   is there a friend you could give it to  You want to try to work with yourself as much as you possibly can   any little barrier you can put in the way of yourself and a smoke is going to help you a lot    I also found it really hard to tell my family early on in my struggles   but again  you want to work with yourself  Any grain of moral support or encouragement that's out there in the world for you is something that you A  completely deserve and B  need to help you fight this battle  if you can reach out for it   Rooting for you today  You can do this   My life had completely fallen apart  I lost everyone I loved and was all alone  And I deserved to be   I'm a writer so I just threw myself into my work harder than ever  Whenever I felt the urge to use or drink  instead I wrote  It became my new addiction   Now  I'm very happy to say  I got my dream job with my dream company writing creatively full time  It took years of patience  hard work  and a lot of sacrifice  but it happened  And I owe it all to getting sober  True  thanks  Absolutely  that's incredible  You should be proud of yourself  keep it going   Good morning  2 days out of 31 were successfully completed  i am really happy and proud of my self   goodluck everyone      You can do it   Stick with it  Your progress is impressive  congrats  I deleted Facebook but mindless browsing can still be a problem     Yeah I'm moved in with 2 really good friends and held my job for 7 months so I'm doing a lot better and sleeping inside more       thx I am UK based last night i took some 5htp before bed it seemed to help quite a bit with getting to sleep and I don't have that groggy feeling of taking sleeping pills  My plan is to use it for the first week just to soften the blow of withdrawals   If it's not a state mandated test  applies to US only  then they cannot legally watch him take it  so either get expensive fake urine or somebody's piss that you know is clean  Dont let it get you down  man  I recently got back on after a tragedy  and im trying not to beat myself up too much   So it's the 3rd January and it maybe because it's the first day back at work but I feel this horrible sense of doom and misery     Hoping this will go soon   1 day clean now  In AA  Step 1 is  We admitted we were powerless over alcohol  that our lives had become unmanageable    The unmanagability aspect of this is how we use Alcohol as a solution to solve problems in our life that we cannot manage  from our perspective    Take away the Alcohol  you still don't solve the unmanageability    In the big book it states    Resentment is the number one offender  It destroys more alcoholics than anything else   For this reason  Step 4 involves listing out resentments and processing them and finding a solution    Great post   Keep on enjoying life     I needed this  Thank you   the first week is pretty crazy I almost wonder if it's a lottery at that point  I wasn't sure any day if I'd give in  so much so that I didn't tell anyone  most people still don't know    keep at it  I think the most insidious thing about weed addiction is that it completely reformats the reward system in your brain   of  course  you love smoking weed  because smoking weed constantly has ruined the possibility of you feeling any joy in anything else in your life  by messing with the way your body produces and experiences all the happiness hormones it usually uses to motivate you to enjoy things that you  should  enjoy    On the plus side  if you stop smoking it  joy and pleasure from all of those other things in your life   school  friends  family  romance   will come roaring back in  But those things won't be pleasurable to you until you stop smoking  and for a while  The last time I did this properly it took about three weeks for me to even feel feelings again   I hope it won't be as long for you  but for some really heavy smokers it can take even longer   I'm pretty sure you know which kind of life you want   and you're so young now  You may feel like you've destroyed your life  but as a high functioning professional adult I can promise you that no one cares what your grades were in college as long as you graduate  I think taking a medical leave is an excellent idea though   you want to give yourself enough time to let your brain restructure so that when you go back to school you actually are motivated again   You  can  do this and you  should  do this now   before you end up like us older folks who have wasted years and years of their lives in the same shitty cycle  You're obviously smart  aware of the impact weed is having on your sense of self and your future  and have people around to support you   it doesn't have to be that way for you  Like you said  you've just got to suck it up until the weed washing of your brain fades   and it will     omg seriously   I never imagined some of those super talented and coordinated people on the slopes are drinking  you mean everyone is even better than they seem  For some reason I can never drink mix drinks  I just prefer drinking my liquor straight to get it over with  I sometimes like making Grog but that's when I'm already pretty drunk   alcohol makes you feel OK for a little while  the price for that is digging the hole a little deeper so next time you're down it'll be a little more  and on and on for days and weeks until you forget whether things are really so bad or alcohol is doing this to you  I'd forget about the gym for a bit if your goal is to stop drinking and just focus on that  Weed can cause psychosis in people with or without schizophrenia  It also can cause panic attacks and delusional thinking  If you're hearing voices constantly you should be worried as this can just be the beginning of a downward spiral  You should be taking an anti psychotic with palatable side effects like seroquel or zyprexa  Lsd and other drugs just seems like a bad idea until you level out your brain chemicals and let your pathways and receptors heal  I had some seizures during puberty  totally sober seizures  just like WD seizures from what I've read   like  flailing around  making weird noises etc    still have no idea what that was about    Congrats man  2 months Is when I struggle the most  I've got some time to be proud of have proven I can do it  for 2 months at least   so why not celebrate right  Keeping that mentality of absolutely no drugs that day  every day gets harder as time goes on and I get further away from remembering the pain it caused  Luckily I think about it less as well    oh well  thank science for vivitrol  I live in LA too  It's especially hard here  I know  I think quitting both substances at the same time is smart   I know my resolve to stay away from weed basically disappears when I'm drunk  so definitely be wary of that as a trigger   It sounds like a lot of your friends smoke   but do you have any friends  or even relatives  who don't that you can hang with  In the first few weeks it's especially important to stay away from people who are smoking actively around you  you don't have to cut off your friends  but seeing them less in the early days and avoiding night time hangs has helped me avoid some danger zones in the past   Good luck and stay strong   just remember that because some people can smoke weed and be fine does   not   mean that you can  They're them  and you're you  and you need to do what's best for you right now   same here  we can do it  x God  I've been there  My take   you absolutely did the right thing  Just know that she will likely never agree with that statement    Are you getting the help you need  When I was in that shit I was going to 6 meetings a week   I'd have gone to more if there were more   Personally  I focus the energy and negative emotions on that and try to push them onto drinking  That way  I'm much less likely to drink again  Me not drinking is probably the best thing I can do for anyone I've wronged in the past  and potentially could harm in the future    Haha what is it with shard and jacking off   You're right  its a mugs game  and it leaves you feeling like a shell   Good luck  man  Good job buddy  I am in similar situation and quit just a few days before you  Made it through the holidays without a drop of alcohol  which would have been unfathomable just a few months ago  Let's keep it going  Oh the bag is getting a pounding  Today has been better  shitty sleep but no rage   Yet    you are worth it I'm glad mate  Keep the good fight  I'm still clean  2 hours away from 3 days  Positive mindset  We're all here to support each other  Glad it helped  Yeah  I only hear voices when I've been smoking or going way overboard on stimulants  I had them for a little while before I started using drugs but they stopped as the years went on and I reduced my stress levels   Drinking dreams happen to me all the time  Even now  after 2 years  It is just my subconscious unwinding   And  like your dream  they are more along the line of drinking is not a good idea  So I take it as an internal reset  and NOT a relapse  I suppose it's easier   But still each day   it's important  for me  to recommit myself  Congratulations  Keep it on  one day at a time  Best of life to you  Take all that money you spent on booze  save it up and buy some gear  In college I was the person that didn't ever feel that drunk  Sure the first 5 6 drinks got me feeling good but then I hit that point where the next 10  drinks felt like they didn't even faze me  I'd drink until I woke up  usually with a hazy memory and in my jeans from the night before   It wasn't every night  so never considered this a problem as I watched friends around me turn into stumbling vomit dispensers if they had too much to drink   Look at me  I thought  Guess I handle my booze better than everyone else  Poor fellas   Fast forward through a few years of increasingly frequent drinking and high risk behavior  that I'll likely share in a lengthier intro post sometime   now I see it for what it really was  In my case  handling my booze better than all those friends meant I was the one with the problem  Hi  No chance of him joining you  I can't imagine how hard it must be to quit while the person you live with continues  But kudos to you firstly for trying and succeeding twice  That shows you can do it but need a strategy re your husbands supply of fags  Other people here have maybe been faced the same situation and can give some advice based on experience  But my feeling is that it's down to you  keep strong and keep congratulating yourself as the hours then days since your last ever fag mount up  I'm finding the Smokefree app very motivating as is reading and responding to posts on this board  I know you can do it  and so do you   Most anti depressants suck  Have you tried Wellbutrin  It is a dopamine based med and genuinely made me feel better  I was thoroughly depressed found joy in nothing had no self esteem or sex drive and I thought I had permanently fucked up my brain from my drug abuse  But Wellbutrin fixed all of that and got me to stop chain smoking 3 cigs in a row and smoke a pack a day  Im down to 5 or 6 cigs a day  Cannot say enough good things about Wellbutrin and you dont have to be on it forever it can just get you out of your funk and let you feel better till your brain gets healthier  I didnt want any meds at first I wanted to go natural and wait for my brain to heal itself    it just got worse and wellbutrin changed my life immensely  I know this is frowned upon in leaves but if you are suffering and seriously depressed and apathetic try it    it also is a mild stimulant giving you energy and helping add symptoms  I wasnt able to read for years always stoned or tweaked  Now I am back to reading all the time  My concentration is fixed    welcome   One day at a time  Look into getting back on Medi cal  There may be a wait  but you'll certainly find help  Best of luck to you   You poor soul  I feel your pain  I hope soon enough you will see that alcohol is not your friend  Hope you will join me in not drinking tomorrow  Wishing you the best   Good on you  Given our general lack of everything  wouldn't that much distilled water just suck the last few electrolytes out and kill us   Good job  Stay strong    Use this as an example of "passing a test"   You beat it   Now  you know you can beat it every time   Make a daily commitment to stay free   You've got this  There's more  better fish in the sea  take this time to find yourself   Yeah  turns out I can't die  I guess  Must be magic  36 hours here  Make sure to drink a lot of fluids  get some rest  and avoid stress as best you can Like Nike says  Just do it    Stop now   I find it helpful  read  necessary  for me to view each day as the first day of the future and commit myself to 'not today'   Perhaps that may be useful to you   Stay strong  whoa so long   well I guess we all sometimes dream we're still in school doing homework        What mikspiro said   Way to go  You weren't wrong   A couple years ago  my mother and stepfather spent all of Christmas going nuts on one another  Clearly they needed to be separated for a few hours to diffuse the situation  and there was a family gathering happening around the block  My sister and I offered to drive my mother there  she refused  we went  She called right as dinner was being set to tell us that our stepfather was "trying to set the house on fire" and to ask if one of her brothers could come talk him down  My aunt suggested she call 911 and call her back  she said "kay" and hung up  which I knew very well meant she would not be calling   I took the phone and called  told them everything that'd happened throughout the course of the day  suggested they bring an ambulance  both parties had drunkenly fallen and hit their heads at some point   a cop  my stepfather can be belligerent when drunk   and a firetruck in case he really was burning something  I don't play into her hand anymore  she lives for the thrill of riling people up  and I refuse to give her that satisfaction  I'm not sure why she requires so much negative attention  but it won't be from me  I'm sorry to hear about your mom  And I probably will go to therapy some day  maybe just not today or tomorrow    And well I suppose I do have some creative outlets  I love programming  Maybe I haven't came that far with it yet but it let's me explore some problem solving and I can have something on my mind so I can just forget about the outside world for a while  And I've never heard anyone do that before but it seems like a very interesting idea to just sit there and watch people   I'm convinced out patient does not work for those truly addicted to drugs or alcohol  For those wanting help  and are serious  check in to the hospital  get a couple days in  to withdrawal  then get your butt in a rehab for at least 4 weeks   My cynical side tells me outpatient is nothing but a money grab  or to satisfy some family member  employer  whatever  Not the actual addict  Remember this is ultimately about the user  Like the gentleman above said  selfish program  I have been to both  and outpatient does not work  it is way too easy to slip  get some time sober and it  will be easier to fight when get you out    good post  stay strong  that was my plan  i already have 5 HTP 200mg with chamomile and valerian which is a serotonin enhancer i believe  take this every morning with my coffee and it helps with the sluggish groggy feeling just need a different one for before bed   Hope i don't swap 1 drug for another permanently  I suck and I know it and will not post ever again  I hope this place becomes more of what you all sought needed when you found yourselves here  Im sorry for sucking Im just a dumb drunk  Goodnight you all   I do not understand anything in this life One day at a time   You've got this  New Year quitter as well  I'm right there with you  I experienced a similar mental boost  and began making lists of the things I want to do in sobriety during 2017  reading  creating exercise routines  writing and programming goals etc  I even got out to the store this morning to buy a bathroom scale  ironing board  healthy foods  and many other purchases I've been putting off    That said  physically I'm not doing so hot  For me its that lingerering nausea that is is always there  It's a feeling I've had every morning  and oftentimes the whole day  for quite some time now  and I've on recently come to the conclusion that it's a withdrawal symptom I've suppressed for months  maybe longer  Only time will wear that edge down though  so I'm taking it a day at a time  I think the best thing you can do is focus on taking care of yourself  At your age  you have enough peer pressure to be "cool " you don't also need to be worrying about whether or not your mom's making the right choices   Take this time to figure out what things you really enjoy  and do those more  Even if doing those things doesn't make you tons of friends  it'll help make you the  right  friends  and it'll help actually keep you 'distracted' because you'll be genuinely interested in what you're doing  That's just my advice  Even if it's just sitting there watching people    do the thing   you   enjoy  You've got your whole life to worry about what other people are doing  but that's a lot easier to do when you've figured your own self out first  If it makes you feel any better  I've cried  like  3 different times today  which is very rare for me  and could probably go for a 4th     For me I think it's related to the holidays being over and a bad case of PMS   a perfect storm   Had a good visit with the family   missing that closeness now that i'm back in the city I live in which is far away from them   Anyway  you are definitely not the only one   I hope you feel better      Mine's being serious  For the last seven yaers I was relapsing constantly  yet not using the resources that are available  Although right now these resources are a lot more plentiful and of higher quality thanks to you  and I use them for all three addictions because there's really no difference   And in studying I was always just trying to get by  I wanted good grades  but I didn't work for them  and then when time came that I had to study harder  I was far behind and I would quit  Gaming was taking my time instead  and other forms of procrastination  Even now I'm procrastinating hard  but I'm still doing a lot more than before   Becoming serious about my life  And right now I only have two things   studying and recovery  so it's not really that hard to get serious about those  considering how everything is already laid down before me  If I had to get a job  that would be terrifying and I would probably freak out  But right now I don't have to do that yet  Way to go   I hope your wife didn't mind       Not today  way to go   you've got this  Lol  science disagrees with you  Removed

Congratulations on 40  Fellow 44 y o here   you're not alone     https   www reddit com r AlAnon  Hi there    You could check out this place  It it for family and friends of alcoholics  Maybe you can copy and paste your post there  I'm sorry that I don't have any advice    Good luck   I too am a big fan of the Easy Way to Stop Drinking  That book and audiobook were a huge help to my recovery  I also found 30 Day Sobriety Solution to be helpful  probably not as much as the Easy Way for me but that's not a knock on 30DSS   I have no affiliation with either books and will likely seek other materials in the future   And I agree with others that there is no one cure for all  But for you and me  AA isn't a good resource  SD however has been amazing an amazing substitute  You can beat this   YOu can't change the past  but you might have another 60 years ahead of you   Or you might just have today ahead of you   But  it begins now regardless   So  pick yourself up and commit to 'not today' and then take it one day at a time   You can and will beat this  In fact  porn addiction  as well as eating disorders are the most difficult compulsions addictions to overcome  because food and being horny are common biological needs  and everyone has to deal with them    Who is smearing shit and piss all over your house  I gotta go with Ed O'Neil's monologue about the dangers of bro love  Much love    Good first step of working out when you pick   Mirrors is a big one for me too  What helps me is limiting time spent in front of them by either removing or covering ones that other people don't use  I have been so much better without the bathroom mirror once I worked out that I'd pick the most just after a shower  Another thing that can help  if your bathroom gets any natural light into it  is leaving the light off when you use the bathroom   unless I'm really pressing my face to the mirror it's often harder to see the bits I'd pick at   It's 1AM for me  meaning I just rolled into my third day about an hour ago  Last night I was up until 3am  The night before that I was up until 4am  reflecting on my decision to make it my last sip on NYE hours before  Today I told myself I'd go to bed at 10 to get a full 8 hours  yet here I am as well  While I may be tired at the office tomorrow  it beats being hungover  Good morning  Sorry you can't sleep  but this will pass  Many of us have various tools for sleeping  including melatonin  Sleepytime Extra tea  meditation  reading  a hot bath  etc   I spent a lot of time here and hung out in our chat room with an awesome group of SDers who understood what I was feeling and were incredibly compassionate and supportive   You made it through day 1  now let's do day 2  I'm proud of you and I'm cheering you on      God bless   Pramipexole seems to work for normal RLS  not sure if WD induced is also dopamine related  Otherwise  gabapentin helps   hey  you can do this  i believe in you  and you're not alone     happy new year  What's your advice about porn addiction   Do you have any  are are you just here to be a shit  Please  enlighten us  It's okay to masturbate  People have been doing it as long as people have existed  pornfree recognizes that the problem is porn  specifically hardcore internet porn because of how easy it is to get and how overstimulating it is    Seriously  I think what makes nofap so empty is that it teaches you to demonize your sexuality rather than embrace it  Pornfree is about freeing yourself from porn addiction and fostering a better sense of your native sexuality  what human sexuality was like before instant access to near any sex act you could ever imagine with any body type you could ever imagine   And whether you believe it or not  you're stronger than your addiction  Relapse isn't the end  it's a time for reflection  Try and figure out exactly why it is you're relapsing  what in your life is causing you to seek out porn instead of just rubbing one out with your imagination  And don't beat yourself up over it  Like you know  addiction is hard to conquer  You're trying to dig yourself out of a deep hole  and it's even worse knowing it's a hole you dug for yourself  But if you take it a shovelfull at a time  you'll eventually get out   I get why it can seem impossible to give up porn for good   I'm only on Day 1 and trying to get to sleep I can already feel the cravings coming on   but change is a habit  not an action  It's gonna take a while to get us where we need to go  but people in worse states than us have made it out  and there's a great community here full of support  I think we have a pretty good chance  Fantastic job  Thanks for sharing    3 This is exactly what I needed to read this morning  I'm day three and feeling a little bit    on edge and nauseous  Congrats on day four  I'll be skipping my wine purchases and not drinking with you today  As a person that doesn't remember any of their dreams  I'm really hoping that if my dreams resurface in sobriety I get a few enjoyable ones before being thrown this kind of curveball  Either way  it's better kept in my dreams than in my reality  Yep   I never used it at all for my drinking   But it has been a godsend in other ways   when there was no other choice of course  Checking in  good luck all I love your writing style    I was right there with you  Congratulations on a great start to 2017  I will not drink with you today  D Hi and welcome  Congrats on your decision  I'm glad to hear that you're seeking counseling and will be attending AA   and being here with us on SD is a great start  You may want to check out the resources in the sidebar on the right  such as FAQ's  book recommendations  a link to our chat room  daily check in  etc     In my experience  it was necessary for me to demonstrate my sobriety rather than try to convince any of my family or friends that I was stopping drinking  It didn't happen overnight  but it did happen  Just this past Christmas  I received a handwritten Christmas card from my sister  BIL and nephew telling me how proud of me they are  Out of all my gifts this year  that  in addition to sobriety   was the best of all   You can do this  and we will be right here beside you along the way  Checking in every day  reading posting commenting chatting is critical for me during my journey  So pull up a seat and hang with us   we've got ya     And please let us now how the counseling and meetings go  There's a ton of advice on the internet on how to use other drugs to stop taking a drug  I've tried Kratom three different times to get clean  just got addicted to Kratom instead  then back to heroin when my tolerance to it built up too much   You say you can't lose your job  but you can  Rehab is the best way to safely build a solid foundation  and then at least you're guaranteed 30 days  If you have to lose your job because of that  so what  Are you even using that job for anything productive right now  If they're a great company they'd probably give you a leave of absence  but if not  you'll save more money working minimum wage clean  than that job using   If you need to try on your own willpower  go for it  just please consider the stupidity in taking an opiate like Kratom to give up an opiate  You might as well just take less of your current drug of choice  If you want to pursue the self medicating route to make it easier  I'd try to use Valium  it helps with withdrawal symptoms for me like a godsend  will help you sleep  and while Benzo withdrawals are horrible too  you won't have them if you use them only the first couple of days    you will encounter sleepless nights when you stop taking the Valium  though    It's sort of funny because my anger is what my husband blames me the most for   He has told me  repeatedly  that I need to seek mental health help for my anger   That I am bipolar   That I am insane   That my anger is what has ruined our relationship   And I believed him   I blamed myself   Then   somebody pointed something out to me   I am not angry   I am NOT angry in any part of my life except for his lies and addiction   I am happy   I love my career   I enjoy spending time with my children   Taking care of my house and yard make me happy   Other than getting pissed at being cut off in traffic or something I am never angry   It was a real wake up for me   I am not angry   I am angry with HIM   and his never ending LIES   And that is okay   I am allowed to be angry  Ooooh  have a great day   I notice that when I stand back from the mirror  it does help  I really like the idea of not having the lights on in the restroom  I might install a nightlight  which would provide sufficient light in there for me  no natural light in there   I also pick right after I shower  so limiting my "mirror time" before and after a shower would definitely be a big step to break this bad habit as well  Thank you a ton for your tips  Hey Incognito  YAY    I'm so happy for you  your first day at the new job  I know you've been working on this for a while  so please know that I'm so proud of you and I'm excited to hear all about it  Try not to be nervous   be confident   you can do this   I'll be thinking of you and sending positive vibes your way today     xo 3 years tomorrow   4th Jan   Haven't been active in this sub since I first stopped drinking back in 2014  but it warms my heart to see the community still supportive as ever   Wish you all the best of luck for the future  I'm right here with you on day three and feeling the same  Not terrible  but really not great  A lot like  tobacco withdrawal  same fluttery chest and anxiousness  It's kind of a surprise to me   I'm not drinking today though  Thanks and good morning    Yeah I'm definitely looking forward to feeling better tomorrow  today  than I did through much of 2016      That's great  I feel so much younger now   and I'm back to the weight I was in high school     Hopefully I'll ditch the Ben and Jerry's froyo now lol     Tried  Ecigs before  just made me crave for the real thing  Will definitely try the sunflower seeds and tic tacs  Thanks for the advice  Thanks your the second person who mentioned that will definitely give it a shot  Congrats you a star I'm a chronic relapser  but have gone long stretches  What helps is knowing how good I feel when I'm free of the addiction  coupled with knowing about the regret  guilt  fear  and constant cravings between cigarettes that I feel when I am smoking  What usually ends up getting me back on cigs is not moments of stress anger  but rather vacations  weddings  and big parties when I really want to 'relax and let loose'  It's not even intense physical cravings  those go away quickly   just a weird nostalgia for how  I used to enjoy them  these feelings will pop up unexpectedly   usually when drinking   celebrating like I said   My last major quit  for two years  was a New Year quit  so I know major milestones help me  I also recently went through a major break up  So  I'm using this as a time to really start over  start fresh  focus on my health and well being  When I'm in the moment of a craving  the two things I think to myself are  this feeling is the only path to getting free and that I am the only one who can make myself get through this  Another good trick is that if you're out someplace and really want to smoke  just make a deal with yourself that you won't do it today  but will reassess whether or not you really want to again tomorrow  The next day you of course wake up happy you didn't smoke and not wanting to in the least  Don't forget  no one ever regrets quitting and  literally all smokers want to quit or wish they had never started  It's worth it and you can do it  Cold turkey and without planning  I used the Smoke Free App and came to this sub after the App recommended it    Also talking to other people in my live who had quit successfully really helped   I couldn't dump all my pieces  My history has been to throw everything away and then when I start up buy new glassware all over again  I tucked my bong in a closet and tossed the bowl piece as well as pipes away  Some people may be able to toss it all and I envy them  but I have a history and in case it repeats itself  all I will have to do is drop ten bucks  In the meantime  I know my piece is tucked away  a physical representation of my addiction but it isn't ready to smoke and will stand as a reminder of my problem  It may work  it may not  but dumping all of it hasn't proven to be a viable option for me   Yes  it was a secret in its entirety the entire time I took it  All three runs on the stuff were while pretending to be sober  and pretending to be a recovering heroin addict  It fucking sucked worse than the heroin at times  stomach problems  needing to buy at headshops with cash so my parents   girlfriend wouldn't check the internet deliveries  Even my boss thinking I was using in the bathroom   I was  just not what he thought it was   so I demanded to take a drug test  passed  and was actually fucking gloating about that and made him feel bad for questioning my sobriety  The weight loss from not eating due to a stomach full of Kratom wash sucked as well  The worst part though was hiding my addiction from myself  I thought it wasn't a drug  I thought I beat heroin  and it was safe and healthy and made me feel great  I lied to myself  It was when I was using about 45 grams a day  biking in the rain 45 minutes to spend 20 bucks on that dose for that day that I realized it was  as before  just as powerful an addiction  Hold on brother  I think you survived the hardest part from this adventure or how ya all want to call it   Hm  I think most of us have been at the point of self disgust  but have you considered seeing a professional on the matter    I'm not sure how much I can help you here  but hang in man  realizing there's a problem is the first step to recovery   Oh the irony   This was an amazing read  Thank you so much for sharing   You really just said timbf isn't a great guy  Who the fuck are you  Ah  so it's just temporary anxiety  Have you talked to a doctor about it  There are also relatively side effect free OTC options to help with this  passionflower  valerian  a cup of chamomile in the morning  that might help relax your nervous system    To me it sounds like your brain is compensating for lack of nicotine  inducing central nervous system irritation to make up for lack of substance induced nicotine  I'm not a doctor though  just a crazy person  so you should totes talk to a doc  That's great news  Onwards and upwards  You did nothing wrong   You did nothing wrong at all   I wish I had something to say that would help you but just know you are not to blame  You're hysterical   I'm still f'n laughing   That "But 2016  " paragraph is epic   Congratulations on 280 days and all of your wins  You're truly enjoying all the news things that you're trying  and who cares if they are a first at 28   The bottom line is  you're doing these things sober   AWESOME     When I lived and worked in Manhattan  I used to spend a lot of weekends walking all around the city   unfortunately  I was still drinking and wasn't able to truly enjoy  or remember   it  Maybe ice skating in Bryant Park will be on my to do list for '17      Interesting  I didn't even know there was a liquid version  I wonder what else is in there   This post has been removed  This subreddit isn't a place for debating different methods or putting other people into categories  Please just share what works for you  "speaking from the I"  Day for 4 no tobacco   You turn 30 and realize if you keep drinking like this you won't see 40  I relapse every couple of months like clockwork  shit load of whiskey and blow but then I get back on the wagon cause it just ain't worth feeling like shit  every god damn day   I hang around now mostly to look at the posts and go fuck  glad I don't do that anymore  I will not drink with you today   Yes it's a serotonin enhancer  I hadn't thought about taking it in the mornings I know valerian and chamomile are good for sleep too along with calming anxiety  I am going to get some chamomile tea today    Yeah that's a big worry for me too  I can't see 5htp being too hard to quit as long as it's not used for a long period  it's way less fun than weed     I wish I was normal at 7 days  It always takes me at least a month  usually 3  I hadn't heard of it  so I looked it up  Sounds pretty similar to what SMART does  Is there any of that near you  Yes    Liquor store is not a stop for me anymore   Feels like Im gaining time at night  Cheking in w  Not drinking w u today    As the old saying goes  "There's nothing so bad that alcohol won't make it worse " Haha I was just thinking to myself  I love your writing style Caudebac  Then I got to the last paragraph and almost lost a bit of my dogs soda water    I'm happy for you  keep doing and experiencing things  I don't know which one you are in the picture but both look joyful and that's what matters most  May 2017 be wonderful for you  I also share this line of thought   Eventually the cost is just too high  You both have to really want to quit  If she relapses it is going to be hard for you to no fall back in your old behavior too  Moderation is not possible for addicts  you have to abstain totally  So I don't really know what you are trying to say here  Soda water rocks  You can do it     We are here for you   I will not drink with you today  X You are not alone  Checking in   All the best to all of you  may we all beat this ugly addiction  Checking in Agreed  Somehow our minds can convince us that it is a good thing  a 'reward'  Your last paragraph does not sound like a reward to me and I want to stay as far away from all of those things as possible  So  I'm not drinking today  Ah yes  I'm reassured that it was a good choice whatsoever  It's hard to be sober all the time but it's still better than getting drunk on occasion  I like you approach to failure    The 1st one  Sorry  don't know what happened to my comment  But yeh  aplogies if what I said was misleading  I mean that I rarely had days off before this dry spell  I just turned 47  And am finally feeling young ish  again  Finally    Oh  and I had someone tell me yesterday I don't look like I'm 47  More like 41  Lol    Dawg you got this  Have u heard of the term apples and oranges u fuckin idiot It just seems so many here think it will  I'm sure for some it will  but for those who are trying for a year plus with just willpower  they might need to try more than wp   I bet  Congratulations   Keep it up man  Hey I too have CHS  It's not worth the high  On another note  the only thing that helped was taking long and very very hot showers    Best of luck friend  Yeah it's just a false belief that it is numbing you  while numbing does contribute to feeling depressed and anxious in the long run  The best way to get rid of unpleasantnes is to express it    Not numb it down    It's a lesson I need to understand but it will take a shitload of time  How about  you seem a lively gent  but I'm going to over take you slowly   It seems to me the that this is a blessing for you  This is giving you the chance to get off of the rocky road you are on  Don't you get hangovers   How do you disguise things like that every day   The best thing you can do is not go back to the bottle shop   You print your post out  take it to a doctors appointment and say 'put me in touch with someone who can help me here'   Book the appointment with your doctor NOW  TODAY   The quicker you make a step in the direction to get the real help you need  then the better you will begin to feel and the nearer the end solution you will be   From what you write  there appear to be multiple issues going on that just stopping drinking is not going to solve   Sure  stopping drinking may help it  but you need to solve the underlying issues too  Define works for you   This too shall pass  and probably has by now   Can I sign in for it  I think similarly  I have GAD since childhood  so it's not possible to be the only reason  But after starting with alcohol my drops were much more intense   Well done mate  you only need to not use today  and repeat tomorrow    On the bright side  I'm not using anymore     I'll try to find a moment when I'm free to get to a doctor   It's just that my doctor's always booked for weeks on end  so it might take a while    A long while    I stopped and started back up plenty of times and it wasn't until I had wrung every last bit of pleasure out of alcohol and it had hurt me so bad that there was nothing left to come but death that the craving stopped  It's painful to watch in others that are like me and I salute those that successfully stop drinking before that point  Welcome back   You're very lucky to have such a wise father  Good luck for you  Yeah it's not even that alcohol makes me feel good anymore  its just a way to not feel how I am in the day to day  I am diagnosed depressed and have anxiety issues  I ended up getting too drunk tonight and threw up and fell asleep in my tub for a few hours still vomiting  had to take a shower and change clothes when I got up    I think that might be a sign for me to get help  I know that feeling of regret  I was also a very heavy drinker on some of those nights  We can do it   I will not drink with you today  My drug of choice was also opiates for years before ending up in treatment for help  I was introduced to NA at this time and had to travel for this meeting as there wasn't one in my local community but it was a great source of help  Not sure if travelling is an option for you  I also find this sub works for me for alcohol and opiates as the thought processes are the same  My GP was also a good starting point  After being terrified of admitting my problem  she couldn't have been more helpful and totally non judgemental  Remember  everything is anonymous  everyone at meetings is there for the same reason  Glad you are seeking help  sign me up boss  It's totally crazy   The idea always creeps into my mind that I've earned a drink for one thing or another though  It's a tough thing to get past   La croix is my favorite   Melatonin gave me awful side effects  Itching and night sweats  I'm not saying don't try  but be aware that it's not for everyone    You can try an over the counter antihistamine called Phenagen  sp   as an alternative  Here we go again A rough second half to a year I thought was going to start and end sober It is what it is  and I am back for a fresh start  I will not drink today I commented about melatonin lower down  https   www reddit com r leaves comments 5lofkl   dbxu68b 'Beyond Addiction' by Jeffrey Foote might be a really good read for you   Also  Alanon groups may be useful to help you set the boundaries based on the experience of others   If your SO is undertaking some sort of program to help  then I think that is a good thing and gentle encouragement is in order   However  it is also useful for you to allow your SO to find his own way  and to help recognise if the program he is on isn't the right one for him  and for you   By that I mean that keeping a discrete distance at first can be a good thing  because if multiple relapses happen  then you may need to be in a position that can help assess if the program is a good fit or not   There are lots of ways out there for your SO to use   Each has it's good and bad points and the key is for him to find the one that suits him  and your situation the best   I would also suggest you check out r Alcoholism Medication   If you SO can work a program and stay sober without medical intervention then that is awesome   Good for him   But if he cannot  then it is not a good idea to stay on the same  failing  path but perhaps acknowledge that he may need some medical support to help him break through those cravings   Traditional treatment tends to work on the assumption that this is a moral failing on his part   he is morally and spiritually bankrupt   and the only way to remain in recovery is to work a program that enables him to stay away from alcohol  one day at a time   More scientific treatment works on the assumption that certain pathways in his brain have been strengthened by repeated alcohol drinking and that in the same way we learn other things  his brain has learned that alcohol produces a reward in terms of chemical activity in his brain   Disrupt or short circuit this particular pathway and it can really help him deal with any other issues without the constant craving to drink   If you find it useful  this is a really good  short video that explains what is going on in his brain when he drinks   It's less than 3 minutes long  but is very informative   Understanding will help both you and him  long

your body heal  Good luck  I will not drink today  That's where I'm at right now  3rd day in and the smell of fresh smoke is downright delightful   Better different than when I was smoking  No it doesn't count  Forget it  I really don't understand why anyone would give out oxy for a tooth pull  I wouldn't get anything here in the UK   A case of over prescribing if ever I heard it    No offence OP  Keep up your good work  What do you mean by "its not sustainable"  I've stolen more alcohol from friends than I can count   I'm very good at it in fact      Life is so simple now I don't have to

Good luck and I wish you all the best in the world for a complete and speedy recovery  Well said   I drank to celebrate being sober a couple of times  oh the irony  First day back to work after Christmas vacation  10 ish days   and I'm not drinking today   Good luck  Just think you are stronger mentally and physically then if you were drinking  Let us know how it goes   I will not drink today   Tues Jan 3rd    Thanks SD  I'm 45 now  Quitting the booze and exercising more has helped me feel the youngest I have for years  I'm sure a lot of it is down to losing the beer weight   Keep on

generally over by tomorrow I can tell you I find it harder each time  hopefully this is my last time Hang in there everyone Just this morning I ruined my arms  so recovery isn't really in sight     I

an awesome success rate whilst you are in there  simply because someone is being detained away from alcohol   Wow  yes  how easy is it to get a 90 100  success rate for 'x' number of weeks whist someone is simply not able to access alcohol   There success failure rates are based only on those who discharge themselves   But the real proof in how good their treatment is in how good they prepare

that come from repeated attendances   Especially those who serve the famous or bleed your insurance services dry   I mean  how many times do they take the money from the likes of Lindsay Lohan  Paul Gascoyne  Amy Winehouse  River Phoenix etc etc   Why didn't any inpatient treatment centres assess them and say 'you know  following a full assessment  we don't feel that you are really ready to stop drinking drugging yet and so we don't feel you are fully suitable for inpatient treatment yet   We don't feel our services will work for you because although we can keep you clean for a couple of

toy next to my bathroom mirror  a balloon stuffed with potato flour  it's a noisy one  to help me snap out of it   You can either look for fidgets and stress toys to buy  make your own  like the balloon I have  or use any everyday item to keep your hands busy  I like keeping a water bottle around me at all times  It's fun to play with and whenever I feel like picking I take a sip    somehow that helps me   But remember that fidgeting is just a way to avoid picking  If you want to actually stop  you need to get to the root of it    It took me a couple of goes too  I think it does for a lot of us   I know that I will never be someone who can naturally moderate intake  regardless of how long it is from my last drink   Today I have one rule  Do not drink today  That's it   I will not drink with you today  this kinda sums up stuff  next time ill try cake and look forward to a no drink day Just to ask the question about seeking help means that recovery is in sight   Pat yourself on the back for that because it really is a good move in the right direction   The most important thing now is that you don't stop the momentum   Keep going until you do access the help you need   If your doctor cannot help you  then search places in your immediate area that can   There are always ways out of a situation  the door is always open   It's just that once you ask for help  you must walk through it     otherwise nothing will change for the better  You can do it  The hours feel so very long at first but it gets better  Trust me  I hear you  That feeling has also overtaken me quite a bit  I've stolen alcohol from my ex girlfriend's parents at their own christmas party  Sneaking into their basement every hour or so to put back shots of their own liquor  Stolen my parents debit cards to go buy tall boys at the store hoping they would never notice on their bank accounts  Stolen money from my sister to do the same thing  Always got a excited  elated feel during the whole thing  then afterwards cried horribly and wanted to harm myself  Alcohol is a powerful  villainous drug and it does not discriminate  Take care and learn from our mistakes  Happy new year     Hilarious  Well done    Oh HP  I'm so sorry about Grandpa  Having watched your journey and reading your updates on being with him  I am so very proud of you for being sober through this most difficult time  I can only imagine how proud of you he is  and how much he loved having your company when he needed you most  I know how much you love him and how much he means to you   I promise to keep you and your family in my thoughts and prayers and I'm sending a warm hug your way  Also  a big thank you for sharing this and letting us know that it is possible to remain sober during the hardest times     Lots of love  xo congrats man  that's Yuge  Right  its hard to move forward without a goal   Engineering and business covers a wide range of jobs  What attracted you being an army officer  Perhaps make a list of all the things you are looking for in a job   Also  many people do jobs they don't like or aren't inspired by  But your job doesn't have to define you  Find things in your free time that you like and are constructive  Another Donut here I guess the one thing about going  in my case  5 plus months  is knowing you did it  and can do it again Many factors contributed to my tough second half of 2016  and as of now I see 2017 as a clean slate Not drinking today  I'm actually astounded  I'm not sure I could've gotten through all that without a single slip up    amazing   I  understand what you're saying  and what Epictetus means  Too much of anything good eventually leaves you  jaded   you start taking more and more of it to get the same buzz  and eventually  no amount  will satisfy you  Great NDV  I like the way you waited it out  hung out here  and played the tape forward  Congrats on a week and thanks for sharing  Woohoo   Congrats on 600 days        Yeah  The wine won't make your kids any less assholeish  but discovering that you ate all the cake might make them think twice    Good on you  I won't drink with you today  Awesome  Great job  Thank for being here     Sign me up Love this  '     The best time to plant a tree was twenty years ago  The next best time is now     As I approach the age of fifty  I often look back  especially at the last ten years  and think about all of the lost opportunities  money  friendships   the list goes on  But that's in the past  I now look forward to all that life has to offer me sober  Good and bad  I will not drink today  Not today  We need to find out if anyone is able and willing to program the feature  The moderators will have to be consulted  and they may have the contact details for the original programmer   It would make sense to have a poll  to make sure the majority of active users of the subreddit are in favor of the change    Happy Tuesday  I will not drink today no matter what  I will not drink with you today  I will not drink today  Yes  2 sober days already  Let's turn that into three  I'm not drinking with you today   I'm so excited by this  I'm home all alone and free the entire rest of the week  normally that would mean a nearly non stop drinking binge  I will join you good people in not drinking for the next 24 hours   Thank you all for being here  Not drinking today  Nope  No way  I have just turned 4 and gotta say  in some ways  I've improved  Heck  not having a drink or a drug in 4 years is pretty awesome   But in other ways  I feel as emotionally retarded as I ever did  It's frigging hard some days   I remind myself that it's just for today  and that it's progress not perfection  And I'm ok  I will not drink today  I'm in   The food industry has just recently caught onto what nutritionists have known for years    sugar is addictive  https   www google com  q  22sugar is addictive 22    Ironically  our bodies evolved that way    back in the old days  it was feast or famine  so our bodies learned to grab whatever calories they could get and  cling  to them   That's the main function of the liver  in fact  turn a temporary rush of sugar into long lasting fats and triglycerides  that can be slowly drawn upon for energy during the lean times  But now we're surrounded by easy access to fat and sugar  but our bodies still function the same way  that's why there is an 'epidemic of obesity'          The solution is the same as it's always been  though    eat less and exercise more     Our bodies  also  evolved to walk    so that is the best  and easiest  exercise  walk  at least  a half hour every day         Now I  know  about  the studies that you are citing  http   healthland time com 2013 05 21 marijuana the next diabetes drug    they do show a correlation between lower blood sugar and cannabis consumption   But  exercise  has a more efficacious  i e  better  effect on the body   overall   than cannabis intake  so  that  is what I would recommend  You did it  It's a great feeling  Mm for me that was the point  Moderation isn't possible for addicts so it's not really an option to try    I'm not trying to say anything other then throw it out there in case it helps someone like it did to me   Cheers   Day14    Yesterday was a recovery day and I was off    I didn't have as bad acute as some here thanks to an odd taper but yesterday I felt like I was back at day 4    Just no desire to move    No motivation   Nothing but some serious cravings    I went to bed early and hit the gym this morning   seriously I know it's the last thing anyone wants to do   Especially at 4am but get up   Force yourself    Get out and exercise   trade those first crappy ten minutes for 3 hours of feeling normal again   it really has been the difference between success and failure for me so far      Anyway   Two weeks    That's my record    Working on week 3 now One week  Way to go   Just went another day without  Exactly  thank you   I don't know how SD feels about non alcoholic beer  but that's whats been getting me through  I drink several a night  and it took me a looong time to find a brand that didn't taste horrible  This may not work if it leads you to wanting an actual beer  but it's been a great substitute for me  After the gym or a hard day  I look forward to having a cold one  Still pricier than carbonated water but I've been sober nearly 2 months this way  Welcome back  my attitude was try and try again until it sticks and stick it has for over two years     I tried and slipped many times but each time I tried I got stronger  more confident  more committed  You should never feel ashamed or regretful after masturbating  It's natural and studies suggest it even might have health benefits   I think the danger with masturbation as it relates to porn addiction is just that it might lead you back to porn  It certainly has for me in the past  If you can separate the two  I don't see any reason not to do it   Of course there is always the possibility of getting addicted to masturbating alone  but that risk is there with anything that gives you pleasure  from video games  to food  alcohol  drugs or driving fast cars  Be mindful of that  I guess  For me  fear comes from the  unknown   Speaking honestly to my doctor about the physical problems that I was experiencing was the first step   You should also know that most  if not all  of my problems improved greatly once I stopped drinking   Get to gym regularly and improve my running time distance   Get back to doing yoga for peace of mind relaxation flexability   Eat good food I will not drink with you all today  Sounds like a fucking nice day  all the best for your first day  how exciting   Well     u upinblue basically said it all in his post   I'll just add that about  10   of all people who start smoking weed eventually have a tough time quitting it  it's a bad roll of the genetic biochemical dice    just as a similar proportion of people have the same thing happen with alcohol           This  is the place where many of those people end up    often after a prolonged dance with the mocking maiden of moderation    and finally decide that   abstinence is our solution     But don't feel bad about that  weed is the easiest substance to kick  and when people recover from it  they find that their lives are  much  much  better without it than they had feared when they were in the midst of the Green Cloud   Once you have made up your mind that you  truly    want   to quit  you are on the right path and  you will succeed   I actually just got to read these replies  Thank you  It is if you own the correct device    Text to Speech  Enabled  Text to Speech is available for Kindle Touch  Kindle Keyboard  Kindle  2nd generation   and Kindle DX    This is from the Kindle Store on Amazon  spending new year's eve with people who don't want you driinkink'  they take shots in the corner I see you   why even hide it   It just makes me mad I won't drink today I will not drink today  You can do it  The drive home was the hardest part for at the start  I will not drink today   I will not drink today I will not drink today  I quit smoking almost six years ago and to this day I still sometimes have those dreams  They are always the same  I start smoking again  telling myself "I'll just smoke a few  I won't get addicted again" and then some time passes in the dream and smoking has become a part of my daily life again and I can't remove it from it and I feel deep regret and shame  The feeling of relief I get when I wake up is really just the best   In case anyone was wondering  Yes  quitting porn is so sooo much harder than quitting smoking  At least for me  Wish there were porn patches  Hey SD  I'm not drinking today  Hope you have a great Tuesday  I come with the dawn  and today  I will not drink   Excellent analogy  This made me laugh  Nicotine Replacement Therapy might be a good idea  at least for a while  then you could taper that off  The fact is that you are having a  very typical trip  through the nasty part of quitting   here's a post  https   www reddit com r leaves comments 1ronw7 need help quitting cdpfd76   which talks about those feelings right up front  The longer you are out of the Green Cloud  the  stronger  you will feel  Ironically  the 'rewiring of your brain' is actually  your brain automatically returning to its healthy state     the omega 3's I mention in that post will help considerably in this respect     You can do this    How lovely that you were able to see that someone needed help and you not only knew what to do but you did it as well   Sometimes we don't see what we need to see until long after the event   I hope your friends son finds a way to make the most of this opportunity and is able to learn from both his own experience and yours  Thoughts and prayers for your friends son  and blessings for you  I am back in my office today and OMG I am not enjoying it even though I love my job usually  Fortunately my boss is off until Thursday and many other people are still away so it's a gentle start  But I just want to go back to sleep  For me  I tend to wind myself up on caffeine all day at work and not eat properly  then I'm so hyped up I "need" a drink to calm down in the evening  Need to break that cycle if I'm going to stay sober  I think your subconscious might be trying to trigger you  Be mindful of that  what the fuck I will not drink today  Sweetie I am sure that as long as you keep remembering that senero you will stay on the right track  Just keep pulling it together 2 days in  back at work  very anxious but I will not drink today   I'm in      u Brzyo is exactly right  you  both  have to   want   to quit  We constantly say here "Quit for yourself     not  for someone else " That way lies resentment  whatever she does  you need to do this  for yourself   I would definitely say it's normal  When I quit porn I go through phases where I can't even get an erection  It will all be better in the end  Day 3  back at work  feeling basically okay  Not drinking today    Reading  This Naked Mind  helped me recognize alcohol for what it is   A poison   Rewarding myself by poisoning myself is no reward  I will not drink today  Best  Decision  Ever    And congrats on the NDV  Keep up the great work   I will not drink today Congratulations on 5 years  I always get out of sorts on my birthday  so maybe soberversaries are the same  All that anticipation and expectation and emotion   I will not drink today   I just want to also reply to this     Its so confusing for him  as his friends all use it constantly  hes constantly reminded every where that men use it  and that its a thing that women just need to accept and get over   I don't want to speak to the general public and its attitude towards porn  but the thing is  If he's an addict he simply can't partake in activities that are "normal" for other people  Like  I used to be an alcoholic  so I can't even have a beer now  even though other people find that normal and just use it to unwind after a long day or whatever  If you're addicted to porn you can either not use it at all or let it ruin your life   Porn addiction is something very new in our society  lot of people don't understand it or believe it exists  It helps to compare it to other more established addictions  like alcoholism   Best of luck to the both of you  yah  you could even save your mini bottles and refill em  if you like the stealth of the small container   I had never heard it put this way  so true   Not drinking with you  Got almost 8 hours of sleep last night     I will not drink with you today    Three weeks for me  what a blessing  thank you SD Best of luck to you   I will not drink today  I am a stresser too  I will scratch most of the day when I am at work  I find the only way to get around it is to focus and not procrastinate   I found that keeping a diary is helpful to identify 'what' is stressing me  It isn't work which causes my issues  it is the fact that I will have plenty of time and still not finish the important parts  Still working on that part    In the meantime I have found a gentle topical local anaesthetic  bug bite cream called Soov  has been pretty good for taking my mind away from the red spots ingrown hairs on my cheeks  Pulling beard hairs  and dealing with infections    I tried NAC  N Acystaline I think  with little success  You might want to check out the higher doses  2400mg per day  or there abouts   It works well for other addictions  and people do report some improvement with it    Check out the threads around here for both tips and motivation  Good luck  and welcome to the road to recovery   Nothing like the holidays to set the stage for some high drama   What your Step Father did was illegal    He's crossed a personal boundary IMHO    going from yelling to shoving and especially the bit on the glass  extremely dangerous and I hope you weren't hurt   Unfortunately  getting any accountability out of either of them will likely be an exercise in futility    Even if you file charges  something that should be done  but would mire you in quite a legal hassle with a couple of addicts and likely not gain you much  other than him being held somewhat accountable    something that's likely a crap shoot  since it would pit your only sober witness  your friend  against your family       The bottom line is that you probably can't get through this without a family counselor    you need a sober 3rd party that's going to tell the two of them that their drinking is harming their relationship with you      In the mean time you simply can't be put into situations like this    This is a rough situation and it's seriously out of my league    I hope someone on here has some better advice    IMHO  I would limit my discussion and contact with these two jokers until they've hit a point where they realize  only when they come to you  in other words  that they've done damage   I'd be extremely careful in how I delivered the news  otherwise it's going to turn into a shit show of "she's so ungrateful  how dare her  etc  between the two of them    You've got two family disputes  theirs  which is likely co dependent    and yours  which is unhealthy but obviously nothing in your span of control     You have now experienced first hand why some policemen don't like stepping into domestic disputes    namely the husband and wife can easily turn on the police officers   I hope you have a good support group of your own  because it sounds like this going to go on for quite some time    get to a meeting nearby and keep going  because IMHO you're going to need some sober counterweight to this      I'd be extremely careful of any contact with them in person    I'd make it clear  when your stepfather and mother are sober    that if either of them ever touches you again it's a legal issue    Maybe even find a way to deliver that message in an unavoidable way    like through a subpoena     Yeah  this is out of my league    The fact is  some serious lines were crossed when they started yelling and shoving you    You have a right as a human not to put up with verbal and physical abuse  and it needs to be respected   Hope someone else here can give better advice    I'll pray for your serenity   I'm not drinking today     2016 was crazy  I've been using for a whole year since my relapse holy shit    It's time to man up and call some detox places and go into rehab like I said I was  Keep on truckin on bruh  I will not

is the homie  I would give him the fuller drink any day   I quit with my partner  but we had to come to a place where we both truly wanted to quit    At first I mainly quit for him because he wanted to   This didn't work  I wouldn't last and I would still smoke with or without him  I had to want to quit myself   and then gradually it started happening  he ended up stopping a month or so before me    So big drawback   most times I lit up   he couldn't say no  Big plus   you have someone who knows exactly what you are going through and you can talk to about the withdrawal etc     I will not drink today   Good work  It's the right thing to do  Your body will adjust to being nicotine free sooner than you think  It's a difficult struggle at times  but this journey to be free from nicotine addiction is one of the best I've ever taken   It feels so good  I feel so healthy  all my smoker friends got real sick over Christmas  chest infections etc  but it didn't affect me at all  and I was around them a lot  feels like my body is giving me a constant high five for not purposely damaging its ability to fight off disease   There are so many benefits to being smoke free  just keep going and over time the smoking thoughts will lose their grip on you  congratulations    Interesting Thankyou both I know I do  she knows she also needs to  I want to  She does say she also wants to but I believe it's for me and cause I speak of it not cause she actually wants to witch kills me I know the quality of life I want and know we could have  I couldn't leave her for it but it'll be near impossible to quit while she doesn't  shitty situation  I will not drink today  Annie Grace also offers audio courses at thisnakedmind com There is a fee I believe  Samesees   You fell off the sobriety horse  Get up  dust yourself off and jump back on  Every day's a rodeo  Just hold on  If it works for you  carry on  I did one in 2013  It's awesome  but you'll hate yourself the day after the event  haha   Tvarscki Ginger Ale is my drink of choice  so that is part of why I'm posting   I had zero withdrawls   I slept fine   If I was still around my stoner settings    I may have very well been up all night   But my mind was so occupied on other things  that I didn't get those symptoms  Not a wrong choice Boi   Not going to drink today   The most impressive things are not giving up  and deciding to take the nextstep and post   you're learning and thats a thing to embrace  I'll be happy not drinking with you today  you helped me not drink  thanks for that  M all the withdrawls we have are almost all emotional   Allow yourself to be angry if thats what needed   it will pass  Theres 'meetings' and support at the needle exchange on 6th cant vouch for it never tried smart Also in sf cleaning up see harm reduction doc n on subs Day three of drynuary   Woot    Yesterday I watched someone else drink and wasn't even tempted  Might seem no biggie to you but I was proud of myself  Since you have a measuring stick how long  I mean I'm a moderate 6"  sorry 5 ish inches damn thing is shrinking  Don't be shy at this point man  I know that feeling of oh fuck me work in 4 hours though  And thank you for posting for the rest of us who need a reminder why we stopped  I'm 49 and started smoking alot when I was 24   Never ever quit until a few years ago for the first time   I love weed but its been an interesting ride quitting   Its just evolving enough now to quit again because its a journey to love yourself and become conscious again with no weed   I have found that I have grown the most during the intense "withdrawls" I had from quitting cold turkey   I do know know that alot of it was just a trigger for something deeper  its not the weed or lack of it really   Take care and Bless   Off to work I go   I will not drink today     What brand do you like  I've tried a couple that were just horrible  I will not drink today  I was at public transportation  first time I was able to watch people in the eyes  I have AS syndrome so it's kinda hard for me  I have a huge social anxiety disorder but this time I just breathe my fears in and conquer them  I feel peaceful now  Just listening to Siouxsie and the banshees  The birthday massacre  Cradle of filth  Shining and The cult  I like to isolate now  Wondering if there is any good women in today's society   Welp  Today's day two  Worst night of sleep I can remember in a while but I'm gonna stick with it  The fact that my fianc ALSO didn't drink yesterday while we were at home was so  so helpful    I will not drink with you today  It's a newer show on Netflix  Heard it's similar to Stranger Things   First day back to work  Tired but feel strong and hopeful  I will not drink today   I love crunchy chocolate cake in the tub  go buy yourself something you would have used the money to buy more weed   Even if its something little  go buy new shoes   it helped me  CELEBRATE your 5 days or how many   you deserve to reward yourself  5 days sober is hard  especially in the beginning so much respect to you   You just need a reward   and that comes in many healthy ways    LIsten to motivation speakers on you tube   its not corny it works when you need it      bless   I will not drink today  Today might be a stressful one due to short staff at work but I got this  Planning to go for a run tonight that will be my time   Good or bad  I will not drink today  Woot woot     Congratulations   I will not drink today     Congrats on four months   How awesome   I will not drink today    In 18 days I've had 0 issues at home and 1 slip up while travelling  but I simply came up with some rules for that as well  when travelling the computer and phone cannot be kept in the same room as I am in  if there is only 1 room then they must stay in my luggage  and have had 0 issues in 8 days of travel since  Given my history I will say this is nothing short of remarkable for me  I did the 12 steps for alcohol   Step 4 5  moral inventory and sharing it with someone  I was eager to do because they told me it would bring me relief   Then my sponsor dropped the bomb   "by the way  you have to tell me your deepest darkest secret  something you would go to the grave with  and I'll tell you mine  "  That part scared the shit out of me   Mine was that I was a virgin and looked at porn   He told me his and I realized mine wasn't a big deal   And in hindsight  neither was his   So freeing to be humble  open and sincere   Now I would have no problem telling anyone either of those things   Funnily enough  I'm not a virgin and I don't look at porn anymore   Coincidence   Actually  not really   You're right opening up and getting rid of that shame is essential for being healthy  happy and whole  Cool stuff   Glad for you mate I get that   usually because I know what Im supposed to do and dont want to   I do it anyway  Man i hate that  Peace and good fortune and thanks for not drinking with me today Good morning  Not drinking today   Congrats on 3 weeks and a good nights sleep  Its hard to beat someone who never gives up  Your sober time is your sober time still  get back in there  Try to identify your triggers that temporarily rewired your brain and convinced you to make that choice  most of us have them  It gets easier   i am early in still but I promise it gets easier when you have a couple weeks under your belt   One week down   Way to go    I have quit many times myself  I am 29 and have been quitting and slipping since I was 23  First quit was a year when I found out I was pregnant  Good luck on your sober journey and try not to feel bad about a slip Hi apeman  Good for you  I'm home alone too for awhile  That was my favorite time to drink too    so I am battling my demons  I am very determined to stay sober for the long haul but I'm taking it day by day  Take it easy  I won't drink with you today  Back to work today    No matter how stressful the day is  alcohol will not make it better  I will not drink today  Make a plan to reward yourself on Friday with something   A movie or favorite takeaway dinner or a gadget you have wanted   Having something  other than alcohol  to look forward to always helps me    Sometimes I make a plan to make a favorite recipe which keeps me busy as well    And have plenty of your favorite  non alcoholic  drink available    I will not drink today  I had smoked for 3 years  quit for just over 2  and been back on them for 6 years now  What motivated me to quit the first time was a girl that didn't like me smoking  and I picked the habit right back up when we split up  but now it is the realisation that I am not enjoying it any more  Like  maybe one every few days would I actually look at my cigarette in appreciation   I decided to kick the habit just after Christmas and I'm telling you  it's hard  I'm 7 days in and I think I feel worse than I did after 2 days  But I don't care  If I don't enjoy something  why would I do it    Having stopped before  for over 2 years  I can tell you that you will get the sudden craving to have a smoke  This time  I decided to go cold turkey  I don't want to end up addicted to vape  hence my not taking that approach   I pop a sweet that I know I don't like  so when the craving happens  I get a burst of strawberry  or blackcurrant and I'm repulsed  Having studied psychology  I know this mental conditioning can work    Good luck buddy  I'm new to this thread as well so we'll probably chat again  Welcome  I will not drink with you today  Checking In with you to brother   I only really pick my legs  I'm not sure how long exactly I've ever had completely pick free  but I notice that in the colder months my skin HUGELY improves  I think this is because my high school winter uniform includes wearing tights under the skirt  Unable to see what there is to pick at or feel the texture of scabs pimples whatever  I do it a lot less  unlike with pants or leggings  I'm unable to roll up the bottom and pick anyway  A physical barrier is the only thing that's made me pick significantly less   In my opinion  yes  I could only manage one or two a week   Saturday and Sunday   and found it to be enough for me  AA was not a new thing to me  though  and it may take more getting used to for a newcomer than it did for me   Days    I find that having my tobacco to hand  I have a safety net in case I break  I can roll a cigarette if I want  and have went to roll one  then I remember I am quitting and put it away again  Sell your full pack  but keep the tobacco  the process of rolling might be enough to put you off  Day 3  already feeling a little better  a little clearer  Looking forward to going back to work tomorrow without the usual background hangover  I will not drink with you all today  Ha  Thank you  I'm the dope in the left trying to stand up   And failing   Good for getting help  And I am glad to hear you have a friend sticking by you  I feel your pain Professor    so clearly you have in you what it takes to get and stay sober  I am looking forward to hearing more from you  Take it easy  Keep on going man  ill be seeing you through the end   When u run out and really wanna drink  u can drink anything  well at least I can  Taste is no longer a consideration  I have drank some really nasty tasting shit in these situations  alcohol content is what matters  I'm at a stalemate to find people to care at this point    My mom called me a mistake  my dad abandoned me and my sister is "superior" to me    Wow please be careful  My cousin had the same symptoms and he ignored them until his liver gave out and he had to have a transplant  My thoughts and prayers are with you one hour at a time works also  I will not drink today  no matter what   Wow I love your wording and honesty here  I've saved this so I can reread if I need to  Thanks  I think this a GREAT analogy     So often in my work and in my life I'm presented with "a  solution "   In a preponderance of instances  the "solution" presented is from one  and only one perspective   Often the perspective has not fully evaluated the dynamics of the situation  nor identified contributing and confounding inputs   It is often up to me to change my vantage  and look at "the problem" from multiple perspectives   without the bias  of what I  or others  already think the "solution" to be     I have to put on my scientist hat  and assess the integration of the "thing" I want to fix in the context of it operating inside of  and part of  a larger system   Then I often discover that what I "thought" was the problem isn't the problem  and more importantly  there are numerous solutions  usually better   My work involves improving clinical outcomes and patient safety   Often  someone will contact me and say  analogously  " the arms of this chair bump the desk  we need help in removing the arms of the chair"   They've "identified the problem and already arrived at the solution"  hey  they're "smart"  and only need support in implementing     When I say "let's review the 'problem' " they get frustrated and say in a whiny and frustrated tone "We've  ALREADY  done that  Aren't you listening   Here's the "solution"   We just need your help implementing it "   Then  when we explore the issue free of the predetermined solution  we discover hidden interactions and systems   Similar to the your chair  "we coukd go to the trouble and expense of removing the arms" and later find that we added expense  reduced the functionality of the chair  and never realized that it was also   too high   as well   This of course has parallels to my journey to sobriety   Great story  Last night was tough for me too   But hey  nothing that's worth having comes easily   Stay strong for today   oh i hear that calling too  i reset my badge yesterday after taking full advantage of some days home alone over the holidays   and whilst last night was pretty crappy  again   lots of night time cold sweats and fractured sleep  i pulled through   i will not drink with you today  I am preparing a presentation for tomorrow  Instead of drinking tonight  I'll go through all the slides before going to bed  I will not drink today  I can't believe it's already been a week  I feel much better than I felt a week ago  If I can do it  you can do it  I will not drink today  I will not drink today  It's my 12th wedding anniversary  and we will celebrate with food  netflix and hot chocolate  I will not drink with you today  SD  Day 10  I got you in my pocket   I will not drink with all you amazing people today  i'm on day 2  again  as well  after numerous bouts of sobriety and then binging over the last 3 months so  night one is  always  a disaster sleep wise  it does get better  just have to tough it out  try taking melatonin   good luck to you  Congratulations   Feels good  right  Congratulations on week one  It really was the hardest for me  You may want to go to a doctor  I smoked for a long time  26 years and in theory quit 8 days ago  and never spit up blood  I think it's unrelated  Sign me up I was a habitual smoker when i was addicted  Ran through almost a pack a day  That's when i decided it has to stop  Just thinking about all the negative effects is enough for me to not inhale that nasty poison anymore when I'm sober  It's the partying times I have to be vigilant abt  I get a craving or two once in a blue moon while I'm 2 drinks down  But i have managed to stay smoke free with the help of good friends and also my previous experiences with quitting  I'm very confident that I will never have to deal with the nicotine addiction again in my lifetime  All the best to you as well  Not one puff ever   Also    Do you even feel safe by accessing this kind of material on your phone  I mean   Windows is old as F  and it's still an target for malicious attacks    I can't imagine how unsafe phones are  If you have any personal stuff on your phone  they are one more reason to keep distance from those sites    Bank access are the first and obvious reason to worry    I hope this can help you by cutting the chances you are even going to think about using your phone on the circumstances you told us above        Thank you for sharing  Also  this image is kind of amazing  Great capture   You can do this  Thanks for not drinking with me today     Congrats on your 3  months btw  That's inspiring     Well  I think  I should contact the moderators and they should hold a poll  Good to have you back      I had the house to myself last week as well  and also took full advantage of it  It was not worth it       I will not drink today  Happy early morning SD  I will not drink with you today  I have got a lot out of AA going to two or three meetings a week  I would recommend at least two though  Try different meetings in the first few weeks till you find the one that works for you  I also read this sub frequently and see a therapist so I am not short of sober activities  and it looks like you have this covered  AA members can be a bit pushy and dogmatic but they care  As they say  take what you want  leave the rest  Good luck   Not drinking today  I will not drink today  Hang in there  I had trouble sleeping for the first ten days or so  but now sleep is wonderful   so much better than when I drink   As Worsel mentioned  I find melatonin helpful too  I'll happily not drink with you today  This is my no 1 worry too haha Thank you for the link and info  You're right  I've had anger issues all my life and have been working to deal them for as long  It's not always the case  but at times drinking seems to bring them back out  Especially when I've had a large amount and am no longer in control  Great job  I won't drink with you today  Check Checking in  Wow  you're awesome   D You are a cool person that can also be relied on  what a combo  These violent delights have violent ends    Heroin only begets pain in the end  pain for yourself and everyone who cares for you  I'm a lot like you    about 3 5 months clean  The fear of dying of a heroin overdose and leaving my loved ones with nothing but grief is a huge motivating factor for me  Your post is pretty spot on    All the best in 2017 dude  Also was the finale of Westworld crazy or what  I won't be drinking today  no matter what happens  for better or worse  That sounds like a great plan  I'm 24  my problem was that I caught a treadmill and used my back too much  In the future I'll just say fuck off if there isn't a third person involved   I mean I only learned after the fact that they are 175 250 lbs          Mouseover   or   click   to view the metric conversion for this comment   http   fiddle jshell net ConvertsToMetric xhk4y5h5

man     That was past you who did those foolish things but present you won't because you know better than past you  Onward  OP  I am not drinking today  Not today  Congratulations  Good work  hang in there  After much conversation recently  my SO has now  GASP   realized how long I was drinking before we met  the gravity of my current sobriety  ergo why SD is so important to me   and  therefore  has now left me because he can't handle the stress of worrying if I'll ever relapse   I asked if he'd like to see an SD badge  would that help HIM in my our moving forward    nope  because I can't not do the things I already did in the past   I am so beyond upset that  believe me  I couldn't give two bits of shit about drinking  or not drinking for that matter  today   Way beyond that   Thank you for you  SD xXx not really    I wasn't really trying to look for porn on FB either  I was just 'fucking around' which is a classic borderline behavior for me  She would rather have me wake her up 100 times saying "I really need help" then wake her up saying "I fucked up "  Good job    It just gets easier and easier   Congratulations  Thanks for sharing this song and the sentiment  So much of my time spent drinking was just getting by  Getting through the work day so I could drink at night  getting through the week so I could really 'live' it up on the weekend  Looking back it was just a whole lot of nothing  I'll join you in living for the sake of living  and not drink with you today   Think separate and small tasks  Don't think about "going to the gym" just think about putting on your shoes  You don't even have to go to the gym  just put on your shoes  Once your shoes are on  get your keys and get into your car  You still should not be thinking about working out  just getting into your car  You can do that  right    Just keep operating like that until you get to the gym  Sounds dumb but works for me    AND don't sit down after you get home from work  Just don't   Sorry  but I am most definitely not drinking with you today       Welcome  Toss them out now  You are hedging your bets the wrong way by keeping them  That is  you are betting against yourself   That sounds really shit    I will move forward with you and not drink today Good luck man  Keep with it  That's depressing    any luck with your wife    43 here   No longer worried about dying   Pretty sure I'm one of the worst here but I have my good moments and eventually they will get better  Not drinking with you  I will not drink today  I won't drink today  Good   We all need at least one human being who knows every single thing about us   It's one of the best things we can do for our mental health  I will not drink today  Unfortunately  this addiction is still getting the best of me as I have relapsed today  I really need to commit myself to a lifestyle change as I am simply not putting in the effort to do so  Best of luck to everyone else  I will not drink today  I'm on the same boat but I don't really care  I'd rather be broke sober and happy  Being jobless allowed me to focus on my sobriety  you can do this  I will not drink today  Go to AA  Best 6 5 years of my life  No relapse  Started at age 21  You're worth it   Good on you  Apeman  You got this  Keep with it mate  I'm in a similar situation  A few weeks ago I looked at my life and I saw that the only negative thing in my life that I had control over was my Porn addiction  I was able to kick the computer games out about a year ago  and now I'm cutting down on t v  binges  Stay strong  Day three  This is when the problems you were drinking to forget about gradually come back to bite you  But PMA and all that  drinking won't make them any better  I'm in for today  Wow  thats amazing you got so low  Its so hard for me just to drop  5 tsp  But today I drop  5  Then maybe Monday Ill drop another  5  It seems to take me a very long time to stabilize  Much longer than 3 or 4 days   I can totally relate   turned 50 in 2016  Got sober  too  Wish I'd done it sooner but now I just think "well  my drinking days are behind me and now I get to look forward to my sober days " Yep  And the next thing I know I'm displaying all those behaviors that made me want to quit in the first place  unreliable  calling out sick  drinking all day  etc  Reward  my ass   You can learn to live without drink  And it is worth doing  I found a lot of improvements in my life came with living sober  There are obvious ones and not so obvious ones    The first few weeks are tough  It sounds like you are going through mild withdrawals now  While that sounds a little scary  a hangover is technically mild withdrawal symptoms   This page has some good information on withdrawals   https   medlineplus gov ency article 000764 htm  I think everything you describe fall in the first two sections of symptoms  If you start feeling any of the severe symptoms  seek medical help immediately  In the meantime  asprin tylenol  some hydration  and lots of rest will help you   My big problem with quitting drink was that I'd go for a few days weeks months sober  then talk myself into drinking again  I was an expert at self sabotage  The last time I got sober  I sought help outside myself  and it made all the difference  I went to AA meetings and got all the help I could use  and then some  I'm sober now going on 12 years  I think it made all the difference  www AA org lists meetings near you  it's worth a try   You can do this  Wishing you all the best  First day back at work and it's going to be a super long day  Not going to drink  though  FTZ  Day 1  I will not drink today  I love ginger beer   So great and nice for the WDs too     Of course I don't even need to mix my booze anymore unless I'm trying to pretend for normies   I spent Sunday cuddling with a bottle of vodka just taking swigs every so often   It was great  Congratulations on 40 days clean  Thats awesome  Did you use any comfort meds  Anything to help  I have Lyrica   I'm in  Let's not drink   Day two for me today   Really I just focus on every single minute  not the whole Day or week   I will not drink today  Let's not give Up  Try to intellectualize your quit so you don't get prone to road rage during withdrawals  Catch yourself when and if you feel pissed off    If you do audiobooks buy "Quit Smoking the easy Way" by Alan Carr  and listen to it a few times    Also be aware that caffeine is quickly flushed out of your system by nicotine  This is a suprising fact   You will be very sensitive to caffeine now so be aware of the reason and adjust your intake if necessary   I've felt the same way  and it has got me wondering about the more grand questions in relation to lifestyle and cannabis   It seems to me that cannabis perhaps has little to do with what is described in your post  and my life   It seems to me that my main problems are bounded up with my striving towards a meaningful life  I need to have ambitions that gets me up in the morning  something that renders life meaningful to me   However  I'm a privileged guy who can afford a very casual life  like most Westerners  but without ambitions  be it work related or otherwise  life just becomes a meaningless stream of experiences  Life primarily becomes hedonistic  Cannabis has nothing to do with the   cause   of this but perhaps it's a good candidate to fill the void for me   I guess my point is focus less on your cannabis consumption  try to moderate it  and more on the 'am i getting stimulated in my life' part  Once you have a somewhat meaningful life it makes quitting cannabis much more meaningful and easy    On this part  I like frequenting  r drugs from time to time   I like this sub for its policy of 'no moderate consumption'  it's necessary  but I know I'm much more likely to go from high consumption to low moderate consumption than quitting completely  It's just unrealistic and I also have little desire to quit completely the reason being what i described above  I believe cannabis is fine if you've got something meaningful to strive towards  A male western guy in his mid twenties who spends too much time in front of his computer  me  is a victim of this   cannabis carries little blame  for me at least       "Failure is not falling down but refusing to get up "     Good for you for getting up again    You can do it  Took me a few tries  too  and I learned something every time   Congrats on Day 3   I'm day 2 as well and my sleep consisted of waking every hour sweating and clammy  feel awful today as well with the equivalent of a 15 year hangover but I'm determained not to drink today either  Good luck xx I will not drink today  I will not drink today no matter what happens  She has vulvodynia which causes sex to be painful  That has added to the feeling  It is not fun to have sex when your wife is crying     Honestly I would give up sex if I could  I am a little interested of going back to ssris which made me pretty asexual    Honestly though  Love to me is 99 percent about things other than sex  I used my sexuality as a emotional crutch  ie  some people drink  some people do drugs  I watched porn   had porn fantasies to help me get through the day    That is why it is not fun that my brain still tries to go back to it  But I understand  2 years is nothing compared to a habit I had over two decades    Not to be overly religious but Jesus said on Matthew 15 20  "For out of the heart come evil thoughts  murder  adultery  sexual immorality  theft  false testimony  and slander  20These are what defile a man  but eating with unwashed hands does not defile him    I feel like I am now in the paying for my sin part of recovery  What went down easy  porn   like fine wine is now bubbling up like yesterdays bad booze    I feel bad for all the kids who think they can depend on porn for the rest of their lives as a emotional coping mechanism  They have no idea what they are in for    thanks man  it never is worth it  and yet somehow we fool ourselves into thinking 'this is different'    Hello  What is sl  Are you OK  What the fuck  so few posts  Is the sub dying  Or did everyone quit drinking as new year resolution  I will not drink today Relapsed  Thank you x Relapsed Take one day at a time and know that no one is expecting anything more than you are of yourself   Good lucky buddy  I'm trying to quit too  I started when I was 15 too  now I'm 38  Been trying to quit for years  On day 3 now and it's kicking my ass  and stomach  and head  Stay strong  The first week or two sucks bad  but wasting years of your life is much worse   I have a sixteen year old daughter and although we don't talk about it much  she has been very supportive and proud of me in this journey  I started out doing this so I'd be a better parent  Now I'm doing it for me  to just be the best ME I can be  Alcohol is clearly not part of that equation for me    You can do it  It took me some time to adjust my expectations around celebrations or stressful days  Now I can totally approach those moments without alcohol being my "go to" solution  I really like not drinking   I will not be drinking with you today  It gets easier  You are not a slave every second you stay away  Keep going  Really sorry to hear this  Zippy     Sending cyber hugs your way  and hoping things stop sucking so hard soon  I won't drink with you today  my friend  We got this  True this   Being human has it's challenges  but it is so worth it   ps  it can still happen at 24 years also Yes  That's exactly what I am like as an active drinker  It's looking like a good day to be sober  I'm in  Thanks     Mommy  is that you  Oh  sorry  wrong place  I will not drink with you today  Thank you  day 2 today  seems like nothing but longest I've managed in a long time  Thanks for the support xx So this is the longest I have been sober in more than a decade  probably 30 years    This morning I woke up  made breakfast for the family and chatted awhile until I realized with horror I had not even  thought  about checking in   Every morning it is the first thing I do   So I do not know if I should be relieved that alcohol and not drinking it was not the main thing on my mind  or extra vigilant that I'm getting too comfortable with sobriety   Regardless  I am NOT going to drink today  no matter what happens good or ill   Sending you all positive thoughts  I will not drink with you  I'm sure you've apologized and vaguely noted you're going through some stuff and need a bit of time to open up    Regardless  I've noticed kratom desensitizes during sex  and that seems to only benefit folks with a penis  Might be a good motivator  and the increased workouts  orgasms and sweating should help you in withdrawal symptoms   Good morning  I will not drink with you all today  I exercise 5 days a week and have been for years  through out my whole kratom use  What I notice  I'm still tapering  is that it used to take me 10 mins to feel ok and get going on the treadmill  now it takes 20 mins before endorphins kick in  Im wondering if when I ever actually quit that exercise will even help me  I feel like Ive burned out every avenue   Just checking in  Thank you You got this my dude  I know it can be real hard  but fuck it  nothing worth doing is gonna be easy  Embrace the anxiety depression  let it know that its weak as piss and has no fucking chance of breaking the spirit of a hard bastard like you  Dig deep  exercise as much as you can  and most importantly remember  the discomfort won't last but the clear headedness afterwards will  You'll enjoy life more  be better at   pretty much everything  you'll enjoy socialising more  But the best part is  you'll be a fuckin winner  At least next day drinking works for you  I wish I was so lucky  Doesn't do shit for me unless I get as drunk as the night before  Which just means I will be more hungover the next day  I also have an advice    Don't combine your desire to quit cannabis with a new year's resolution  Those are absolutely terrible  why  because you quit for an arbitrary reason  date  rather than the strong emotions of shame and guilt that prompts most people to look at themselves and do the thought process    Of course you could be at this stage already  but then why now  why not a few weeks ago  Good luck in any case  Thank you for those words  great coming back on here today to all the support   and yay day 2  My body was definitely withdrawing last night I barely slept more than an hour at a time and was drenched in sweat and clammy  not nice atall  but I'm determained to stick at it  and I will not drink today no matter how bad it gets  Thank you and good luck x So sorry  that's not something I had ever even considered was a possibility for someone to say to a partner in recovery   Hope positive thoughts from an internet stranger can help  because I'm definitely sending some to you   I will not drink with you today   Hello just to check in  I'm in track  overcoming  Thank you I will not drink today   I'm so sorry to hear you're going through a tough time     I've been there too  I'm not an angry person but for a little while whenever I got wildly drunk I'd just become this monster  I think you're making the right first steps  Right now your wife needs time  Nothing you say is going to convince her you're ready to change  only time will do that but marriage counseling and AA are definitely loud declarative statements that you do mean to change      You can do it  It doesn't have to be this way  Your reply is helping me get through tonight   thank you  First day back to work after a long holiday break   and first day in a long time I'm not showing up in some state of hungover  Don't need it today  I believe I also have CHS  I've been smoking daily for 20  years  I've only just recently learned of CHS  But the symptoms and the taking hot showers thing gave me chills when I read it  I thought it was a joke  This article was describing me perfectly  I also have intense heartburn acid reflux when I smoke and take Zantac twice a day  I quit two years ago for six months and I had zero heartburn    I came to the realization that I am poisoning myself with weed and need to stop before I do serious damage   A week is awesome  So is feeling regret and disappointed instead of continuing a bender   Use this sensation as a reminder next time you are tempted   Also for those of us new to this  it's  A learning process   We aren't going to instantly perfect sobriety   I lasted 3 4 days first time I was serious   Then 7  then 15  then back to 7  etc   But while there are setbacks and relapses  my overall lengths keep getting longer   So shake it off and don't drink today  i love Berry  Cran Raspberry  I HATE coconut  and I usually love coconut flavored things so that's saying something   What's going on that's making you feel so angry  That's what kind of worries me about the first step   The life is unmanagable part   If I wanted to I could probably keep going drinking the way I was and manage my life as I always have   Does this mean I can't complete step one   It obviously doesn't mean they want me to go back and drink until I'm worse  right    I tried lacroix  lemon lime  It was ok  I then tried canned sparkling water  black cherry  Kroger brand  Enjoyed way more   I will not drink today I'm not drinking today with you fine folks  Checking in and feeling strong like bull  Not today y'all  I'm an addict and we are like children when detoxing  No matter how mild or severe the sickness is it's always gonna feel like the worst thing ever  Patience is gonna be the biggest thing and being firm but also listening when someone feels comfortable talking to you I will not drink today   I'm trying to sleep through most of the first few days to avoid as many symptoms as possible  Steady no more than recommended  doses of NyQuil  Helps you to sleep  Helps with the pain  I'm also trying some supplements like ginger root for sleep  and St  John's wort for depression and just a one a day men's vitamin   No drinking today  I just stayed consistently drunk all day   other than passing out a few times I was never really sober   NYE was a fantastic weekend  In  The more I go the better   I started going once or twice a week   The last two weeks I've been off for the holiday and I've gone every day and it's been tremendous   I'm going back to work tomorrow and I'm going to try and find an evening meeting where I can go several times a week   I'd say at least 4 per week works for me considering where I'm at in my sobriety    Every meeting seems to have a it's own personality however  i'm going to miss this morning meeting that I found but still try to make it there on Saturday and Sundays    I found a sponsor four weeks into going to AA and that has helped as well  Good luck   I'm sorry  This wasn't supposed to get posted  I'm unsure why it did  I injected alcohol       I made this entire post outside of this one and it went through  That sounds great  get your motor running     Hey Lee  nice Palindrome  Not today      Thanks  not drinking with you today   Back to work day at the bar restaurant  Just the lunch shift and out of there  I will not drink with all of you today    I will not drink with you all today  I've been on vacation with my family and friends and it's been difficult  but almost 10 days with no drinking  I haven't decided if I will never drink again  but I won't drink with you all today  I feel like I'm in the same boat right now    my appetite is completely shot  My stomach is super hungry but I can't handle the taste of anything  it makes me sick  I didn't sleep a wink last night   this is hard  Thank you for reminding me that I'm not alone  We can get through it   Please get medical help ASAP  Seriously  get to an Emergency Room now  Yup  2 done  Today will be another non drinking day for me OK I see the other post too  Please seek medical help immediately  If you want to understand how making amends works in AA I suggest you read pages 76 84 in the big book of Alcoholics Anonymous  You can find it online for free  Or look up a sobriety app many if them have the big book for free   I wish I could so badly  Soda Stream with Mio drops    Not drinking today  Nope   Tyler how do you use phenibut to sober up  I have a pack and need to lay off booze for a bit  Just need some instructions  Please go to emergency  Please    Checking in  Still in it      to be the best Me I can be   Alcohol is clearly not part of that equation for me"  Those words resonate so clearly   Sums everything up in a nutshell   I can look back and see so many times when I have been a complete a  e because of the effects of alcohol   What a waste  I'm a big fan of the LaCroix Crate line  The blackberry cucumber  and pineapple strawberry are my favorites  Lime and pamplemousse are pretty good  but I think Polar lime and Polar pink grapefruit are slightly better  I really don't care for LaCroix berry  And the lemon reminds me too much of the homemade limoncello I used to mix with it  so I can't drink it without feeling a bit sick uneasy  I will not drink today  I won't drink with you today  Soccer  La Croix  relations   It's going to be a good day   I will not drink with you  Yeah but don't u need to ramp up your drinking to avoid hangover   Stick with it    Awesome feeling right  I don't think his quote is about moderation after addiction  I thinks it's about moderation before addiction  After addiction there is no going back    It's more of a warning than a strategy   Thank you x  I won't drink with you  I can understand where he's coming from  but yes    I had not ever  ever considered such a possibility either and really appreciate your saying so in this Wonderland x The most interesting times are when you have that crazy roommate but then again you are also that crazy roommate   I once had this roommate who was prone to drunken somersaulting drunken tumbling in general  Who also liked to wear diapers and get peed on whilst projectile vomiting  everywhere            But then again I was a crazy drunken roommate at the same time who did other sorts of crazy weird drunken shit  so I'm sure there's lots of stories about me too   What type of detox goes on at your hospital  Suboxone  methadone  something else   These patients are paying for a service  I tend to err on the side of the customer  and making them comfortable   If you are using suboxone to detox  the patient should be comfortable within 36 48 hours of the first dose    I remember in my detox the nurses had to physically put the sub under your tongue and watch it dissolve  I was sick as a dog   got my first sub around 10 at night and promptly threw up  sub included  all over the crowded med room floor  Policy was that you didn't get any additional and I would have had to suffer through the night  I was real down and just shuffled back to my room to bunker in  About ten minutes later  the head nurse came down and gave me another dose  She basically forced the facility to give it to me  Saved me ass that first night and I'm over two years clean today    Your thoughtfulness is much appreciated   Joining this group as I feel I crossed a line over Christmas and New Year and am determined to get back on track  starting with a dry January  I'll see how I go from there   Had a recent separation and therefore my first Christmas without the kids  As a result I spent most of my time getting wasted to forget about it  then when I did have them back for new year  we do alternate weeks  myself and some friends had a party and I ended up hysterically crying in front of them  I don't think my kids need to worry about Mummy's drinking on top of their parents separating  so here I am  Either way  we got this   Not going to drink today  I will not drink with you today  Thank you  Lee  Good luck with your journey  I'm still sober and in AA after 23 years   so it works  Don't let it go   Welcome   Just thought I'd chime in before I get ready to go to my weekly group session     Unfortunately  relapse is almost a rite of passage in recovery   It doesn't happen to everyone  but it does happen to many people in recovery  and sometimes more than once   The important thing is that you learn something from the experience   Early on in my recovery  I made sure that my house was completely alcohol free   This reduced my temptation to drink   I'm glad to see that you have done that   I was open with my family about what I was doing so I had accountability   I had a friend living with me at the time  so if I was craving or wanted to go out and get more booze  he would stop me   While I didn't do this  many people find going to AA very helpful   At the very least  it helps you become part of a community  be social  and get supports that you will need in early recovery   As your recovery grows  it might be useful to go back to this event and figure out what happened   Relapse does not start with you bending your elbow  but it starts well before that   What was going on around you   How were you feeling   What were you thinking   Once you identify this  then you can start to build up some defences around that   Best of luck to you i will not drink today  One is better than none  two is better than one   three or more would be ideal  Organizing my schedule around making AA meetings at the beginning was one way of demonstrating to myself that I was making sobriety my number one priority  Someone pointed out that I made time to drink every day no matter what  so it should reason that now that I'm not drinking I should have time to make a meeting every day  Haha I couldn't really argue with that   You paged  Let's see    you were with me for about 6 moths and spent a little over 1 3rd of that time in the hospital  so 30  days  That's counting the times you were sent home the day of   yes  i love blackberry cucumber too  i haven't tried polar yet so thanks for the tip  Not drinking today  even if my job stresses me out  even if I feel lonely  even if I make a meal that would pair beautifully with a crisp pinot noir  because no matter how hard I try I will never be a "classy" drinker    Tired at work trumps death hangover   Drink coffee   You got this  Keep it up  To quote Bernie Mac as sampled in the Prince song Pope  "oh no  mf  not today " I believe Mr  Mac was addressing some hecklers  which makes it feel even more appropriate to use here in response to any "hey  lets have a drink" voices I may encounter today  Whoa I also had a terrible night of sleep  and started this thing January 1   I didn't drink enough to have withdrawal so I'm a little confused  I wasn't sweating or shaking  just having really intense dreams and waking up a bunch  I thought my sleep was supposed to get better  but I suppose it's a process  I'm happy with my 5   Have an awesome day  Starting all over again  I will not drink with you today  Day 3  I will not drink today   Every your word is mine  Your summarise is super  I  see you experienced and sensible person  Thanks for inspiration  i am tempted to get a soda stream since i drink so much carbonated water now  i usually drink it in the evenings  when i used to drink alcohol  so i don't think i would use the mio drops since they have caffeine  Thanks for the support I say quit for any reason that motivates you  If it's a random flip of the calendar that prompts you to quit then so be it  Any reason to get healthy and clean is a good reason   interesting  i don't think there are any krogers near me but i might try other store brands  I will not drink today  Hey I'm in the same boat  Got 7 days  then folded for the festive season  This is the third day and I'm feeling good about it  I'm thinking that the mass of family and friend gatherings over Xmas were a little too soon to be strong  whereas this month  in the UK anyway  the world and his wife civil partner's doing dry january so it's going to have less social pressure    The holidays are over and I'm back to work  I will not drink today  I think you did 100  the right thing so that in the case that she isn't crying wolf  even 1 time  you'll know you did everything you could to help her  My partner was an addict and I started going to see a relationships counselor on my own  Which helped immensely  I knew what to do and more importantly healthier ways to feel when he called saying he was in the hospital  We ran through all sorts of scenarios of what to do if he came to my house high  I had someone to talk to when I saw red flags and thought he was lying and using  She gave me scripts of what to say to him  And eventually I had someone to talk to when he fatally overdosed and died a week before our daughters 3rd birthday  Having an addict as a "partner" is so unbelievably stressful but you aren't alone  A counselor can help  You love her  at least in some way  and it's totally normal to want to help and protect the ones we love  even from themselves  Please feel free to message me if you ever just want a listening ear from someone who's been through the same thing  Don't get hungover anymore   WDs went away too and they used to be horrid with puking blood and spider monkeys and shit   I passed out Sunday night   Woke up at 3am and took the last nips off my bottle and then passed out for 6 hours and got up and started drinking coffee and water   Weed really helps me  To me it's a great analogy  "Jeez  even if I could forgo that drink at that party  I'd never be able to not have one at that lunch  and then after the meeting I always have a beer      "    when of course the only thing that I can do that's been successful is to not have the FIRST one   Thanks for your story  I will not drink today  no matter what happens  I will not drink today   I'm Irish too  yes we have the reputation of drinking and it is certainly everywhere in our social settings but there are plenty of non drinking Irish out there     How about speaking to your friends about doing some non drink related activities like the cinema or hiking  Maybe trying out a support group  I have attended lifering in the past and found it helpful  Powder or pill form  I always take mine on an empty stomach  2 to 3 grams first thing in the morning with either Oj or coffee  After u take it try to not eat food for at least an hour or two  You should start feeling the effects in about three hours   It should last for about 8 to 12 hours   Good luck  In regards to getting sick  I have noticed a dramatic reduction in the number of common colds I have had so it was worth quitting for that alone   Not drinking today   I've told people I'm not drinking for X amount of months because dry january doesn't seem like much of a challenge  HA     and that's got everyone off my back for a while  After that I'm going to do the same and say I've lost interest in drinking  Luckily no one I hang around with would try and cajole me into it  it might not be a safe option with pushier friends though  Right there with you bud  I feel the same exact way  All my friends smoke and some went to the mountains for new years and didn't invite me  I really think it's because I quit and haven't really been around because I don't want to be the bitch who is like no thanks I quit  When I do go over there I just smell the dank that he has laying around  I'm more pissed off than anything really  The fact they get to blaze all they want and have chill jobs  Meanwhile I'm in a shitty job I hate and having to quit just to keep it so I can pay rent and bills   It's bullshit  I'm jealous and envious even more than I was when I was smoking  At least when I could smoke it helped me not give a shit  Now I feel everything and I'm so much more depressed than I ever was when I was smoking  On day  19 I think and its just as shitty as it has been since I started  Fuckit now back to work in a shit hole  I really feel when I get this new job and pass the test I will go right back to smoking  Honestly it's the only thing keeping me going   In my local stores  Polar is also frequently a bit cheaper than the LaCroix  And I love Polar black cherry and Polar pomegranate  but they don't carry them in my local stores     About to hit fifty days  I will not drink with you today  Belated congratulations on your year as well   It's been good having you around  To thine own self be two  Yes  And you left out the getting fat and broke part  I'm right there with ya  I think we all have a similar story  I found posting often and reading helps  Getting support helps  Being honest helps  even if it's just with yourself  Water  water  water  Exercise  Journal  I find this helps me tremendously  particularly in times of temptation  There's so much more  but it's all here  Good luck and keep posting  I will not drink today  Good morning  I will not drink with you as today no matter how the day goes  Drinking is NOT an option   Happy new year  Still here  still going strong  It hasn't been easy but I can still remember how bad I felt the last time I used  Don't want to return to that feeling  More later  I have to get up and go to work  Just a heads up theres usually multiple meetings  and different types of meetings every day in your town and surrounding ones  Maybe look for a beginners meeting if the everyone knowing everyone is a problem  the one i go to is in a super small town so they all know each other  but they're also 75  old timers so they're not there to gossip and actually have good input  Week 2 is much easier than week 1  Keep it up friend  I didn't know about this insight timer app  so I'm definitely gonna check that out   I think some different guided meditations could be a nice change of pace    I will not drink today  Yes    Nice one  I will not drink today  whatever happens   Having a really rough week at work  already  I will probably post about it later  but I will not let it "make" me drink today I will not drink today  I will find a way to have a plan   Checking in  Well you are a rare case  Ive went on vacation to the beach  mountains  Canada etc but when I run out of bud I still cant sleep or eat  Ive always had stomach issues and insomnia although We care   Get help   In  Not drinking today   Thanks for the support  I was in the grocery store yesterday  almost broke down  but i just got my food and went home   I get to enjoy another awesome day without pouring poison in my body  Woo hoo  Checking in  Lol I can see you dancing   O Happy Day  Oh Clown  I'm sorry you're going through this  I know the only reaction I can control in situations is my own  but hurts still hurt sometimes  Sending internet hugs my friend  3 It is so damn hard to stay sober   I've been where you are too many times   I've had many a hung over morning where I poured booze down the drain and stood in the shower promising myself "never again"   Then when the guilt and sickness are gone it is so easy to pick up that first drink     Thank you for your post as a "free" reminder to me not to get lazy with my sobriety again  Cran raspberry is great   Go to Prospect Park  it's so cheap   Yet I'm in no way involved with them      No drinking for me today  I know your name it starts with  an A      Mine starts with a C and we used to talk all the damn time   Nice to see your not dead      I was going to say the same love hate  Something about that Cran Raspberry is so good  while something about that coconut is so not  I know right  I've gotten the flu 2 times in 2 months  It's cold outside  Of course I'm going to get sick if I keep going outside in the rain every hour to smoke  I got the ugliest cough last time for 4 weeks  It was loud  wet and annoying  Yet I just marched on outside to smoke while my co workers had to listen to that disgustingly loud cough    Congrats on your 83 days  Can't wait to have that badge  I'm guessing this is true  I still sorta feel like ass but I haven't seized thank god   I like LaCroix  but sometimes I will buy regular seltzer water and squeeze half a lime into it and it's great   I will not drink today   Yeah  hang in there   Sleep takes a while to come back  but when it does  it is glorious    No drinking today Thanks    I will try that if it doesn't improve    It always has when I took a break from booze in the past       Hope you have a great day    Thank you   You too     o   Thank you so much for this  I'm 42 and struggling with all this   Oh I've definitely done that  I used to steal beers out of my neighbor's fridge when she wasn't home  To be fair she  slowly over six months  stole around 6 bottles of whiskey from my garage  That sounds incredibly difficult   Stopping drinking changed my life  and this community has been and will be there every step of the way   SD will be there for you too   You've got this   I was 94kgs when I stopped drinking and got down to 76kgs before Christmas  My love of Christmas cakes and puddings has seen that rise to 79kgs this morning but I expect it to drop slightly now the festivities are out of the way  Appreciate it      If you can  I can      For me a big potential danger area will be going shopping by myself    Better keep the husband close for safety    We can get through today     Sweet  It's really just medical management of whatever comes through the door   because alcohol detox can give people seizures they can check in  but they don't hit my floor unless they can't be managed and are out of control on a less acute floor   Drug detoxes usually happen because someone ODd  my patient yesterday   or because someone came in because they were sick with something else and started detoxing just because they hadn't  had anything   I feel comfortable saying the vast majority isn't paying anything   it's not a rehab where people check in just to get clean and a lot of these people are off the streets   To give perspective  this week I've had drug and alcohol detoxers  stroke patients  COPD exacerbation  and an esophageal tear   Last week I had a couple septic patients  GI bleed  and a pregnant woman with uncontrolled asthma attacks   My addicted patients aren't with me for a full rehab  just to get through their illness usually   We have psych  social workers  case managers  and a chemical dependency team that works together to get them into appropriate treatment if that's what they want   We do suboxone or methadone if they have a prescription elsewhere   If they don't  we do Ativan for alcohol w d symptoms  dilaudid for heroin w d if the doc deems it appropriate   For opiates  they do it on a case by case basis but again  people don't come in to get off the opiates usually  it happens incidentally   Thanks so much for your perspective   I admire that your nurse was your advocate  it's the kind of nurse I want to be for people      Good luck on your continuing recovery  Congrats on nine years      What would you say is the biggest factor that has contributed to successfully staying sober  To all you idiots who think I'm some how invloved with any vendors I'm not  How hard is it to see I was just offering a well known and respected vendor who has a very cheap sample pack  I really don't give a shit who gets clean or not  I'm doing just fine and a hell of a lot better then when I was doing pills  I came here under a different account for 4 years and you guys can only suggest lope and NA  NA doesn't work for everyone but to most if you don't go that way you're going to fail which is pathetic to tell someone and lope is a fucking nightmare at the levels you fools suggest     So to anyone reading this and wanting to actually get clean not just on subs or methadone try kratom  I wouldn't recommend buying from a headshop but you'll have to PM me for info since any links I put these morons think I'm making money off of  Read some of the comments here from people who have turned their life around because of Kratom and think for yourself  I'm done with this toxic sub  you never helped anyways and put people down who don't follow you're path  Great to see you   Your positivity and courage just gave me my first smile today  thank you   I live and work alone at home  and right now there's no work to be had  so I too am on  forced  vacation and will gladly not drink with you today     I will not drink with you today  Today is the first day of the rest of my life  Was trying to figure this out myself    hey user munseescheap    yeah I've been feeling the same way you are  i am doing pretty well  feeling healthy and my career is going better than I'd hoped   yet I have been frustrated lately    personally for me i know it's a mix of working too much  the holidays  and having too many plans  I haven't made any time to relax  seriously  on my days off I am either doing more work or cleaning the house    i can't get out to go fishing  because of the cold weather moving in  the days are shorter too    this time of year is hard on everybody  this is why a lot of people die aroudn the holidays  stress does strange things to people    i guess my advice to you would be to make some time for yourself   and absolutely make some time for some exercise  Day 6  I will not be drinking today   Thanks for the reply  it helps to hear it  I went through such extreme withdrawal from oxymorphone that I have a serious fear of it now  I know intellectually that Kratom is nowhere close to Opana but that fear is still there    I ended up skipping the night dose entirely  Slept good  woke up sweaty with a runny nose this AM  but otherwise feeling okay   HAHAHAHAHAHAHA HAAAAAAAAAA yeah coming here for advice is fucking  greaaaaat  who the fuck are you again I'm sorry  who are  you  again   Subs are better then kratom  You must have never tried to get off them   Hell no I registered and decided to badge up today as well in order to make SD part of my routine      I will not drink with you today  I will not drink today  Shame is exciting  That is why novelty escalation happens    The thing is   Novelty escalation happens in secret   Once you air it Tell people about it  The shame becomes just that  Shame  It is no longer exciting  It is just a shameful thing you did looking for a stronger O   Porn is all about the adrenal rush  dopamine and serotonin high   Comparable to real drugs  A visual drug    The problem with it is the havoc it leaves behind   People unable to understand the novelty escalation  hating themselves   When all along they were just coping with their emotions  Upping novelty to feel better   not understanding that the good feeling of the PMO is ALWAYS followed by a kind of emotional and moral hangover    Leading to emotional instability   I will not drink today  Congrats on one week    I won't drink with you today  for some reason i don't think of calamari as salty  more umami    it depends on how it's done i guess  it's the whole "long time lurker first time poster" thing  it's like no  you didn't lurk long or your first post wouldn't be so fucking shitttty I will not be drinking today Can't do weed  gets me paranoid as fuck these days  used to love it though back in my younger days  Now it's just booze  blow and benzos  Pure fucking hell  I guess you are under 30  wish I could be young again    Been there   know that  Had a terrible cough few months ago   yet i still would be going outside for a quick smoke no matter what  Thats just pathetic  Good luck to you   I am not Eastern European but married into a family that is and have many very close friends who are   Talk about heavy drinkers  But shockingly since I told them I was stopping  they have been very respectful of that decision and have made sure not to put me in stressful situations  Give your friends and family a chance   I was reluctant to but was blown away by my family and friends'  positive  reaction    Thank you so much for this advice  I have thought of asking a man to be my sponsor  I hadn't specifically thought of a gay man  Maybe I would fit in better in the LGBTQ community  I know a lot of these judgments are just in my own head and others are not judging me this harshly  I appreciate your advice  And I know that other people had low bottoms  I am just making up excuses for isolationism   I will not drink today   This morning I forgot something and had to drive home from work   my immediate thought was to have a drink  9am  just because I 'could'  Never mind work  my car  the full day without alcohol ahead    my brain jumped right back to that old habit   Then I remembered I don't do that anymore   I can't believe I thought having a drink at 9am was ever a good start to a working day  or that I would do it without even craving a drink   Not today baby  Today is the first day back to "real life" where temptation is the strongest   I work from home and can start drinking at 8 am if I want    That said  I will NOT drink with you today   Good or bad  shitty co workers  shitty emails  whatever  I WILL NOT drink with you today    Have a great day everybody  Good for you  I was a daily toker  Gave it up for New Year's  So far so good   I will not drink today How do you respond when someone is struggling with leaving AMA   My pt these past few days went from "this is the worst thing ever I'm never using again" to "you people aren't giving me enough  I'm leaving "  She has a history of noncompliance and has left most of her treatment programs because she says she isn't being medicated enough   I felt for her  but at the same time I don't have enough time to respond to call bells every 5 minutes about how I can't sedate her through her detox   Congratulations on your continued recovery  I will not drink today  I'm another New Years Day sober person  I started going to AA meetings and remembered I could join this sub too  Thanks all for the support  I cannot do this alone  Apple cider vinegar  Make a drink from it and it should help with the nausea and stuff   i have one account  this one  i had another one  long story short i had to nuke it  why do we do that  because we have complicated and shitty lives and people find out reddit accounts irl  and most of the time it's too risky to keep an account once you're found out if you're an actual grown up with real consequences in your life   it's not the post  i think jax is referring to the shift in mentality that causes those kind of shitposts in the first place    you're trying to say you're not new  and you don't even have fucking flair are you fucking joking me   One week today  not throwing that away  I will not drink with you all today   I don't have much time right now  but my main advice is to check out the Sinclair Method    Here's a Ted talk that may just change your life  https   youtu be 6EghiY s2ts  It's a medication based approach that can take away cravings for alcohol    It's worked very well for me  and I was in a similar spot as you about a year ago    Good look and feel free to DM me with any questions and I can get back to you another time        Also on day 2 last drink on NYE  I will not drink with you today  Get that sodastream   I think the apricot and mango flavors of LaCroix are my favorite  There was definitely some crying involved  Sometimes it's good to cry though   Well  I'm really fortunate in the job I have now   About two years ago  I took a job with a small firm doing medical debt collections on behalf of hospitals against insurance companies   It's nearly all transactional  with occassional litigation stuff   The pay is not so great  but it's not so bad I can't manage and  I only work 30 hours a week   We have young kids and my wife works really long hours since her career took off  so this really helps the family   Before I took this job  I had my own small firm  that is it's own story  and I have been able to keep a consistent transactional client and I can do real estate closings on the side or in the evenings if I need extra money  or just a night out of the house       Before getting sober  I had these dreams that were grandiose   I hoped to hit a big case early and pay off my loans and just be free to drink and chill   I had done some work for a guy who got rich as fuck doing qui tam litigation and I thought that kind of thing just happened to people   It doesn't   I also completely ignored the fact that I don't possess nearly the amount of charisma  charm and appetite for risk that a lot of successful attorneys have who are forging their own path   Um  and the fact that I am terrified trying cases just in general      For me  I am accepting that the best thing I can do financially for the family is to support my wife's career and to pick up the slack for her with the kids   I pay for daycare  which is more than our mortgage  and help out with my share of the bills   I spend way less than the wife  especially since I don't drink anymore and it really feels like we are on equal footing   I guess I've found that  more than trying to make as much   as I can  a better question for me to ask is "what is the best way I can give to my family "   A lot of this stuff kind of just needed time to work itself out   The imperative for me before I quit drinking was always finding some high paying job I had envisioned in my mind   It was one more way for me to remind myself that I was falling short  Enough of that shit  I try to do the little things right at my work and have learned a lot about a niche area of law that has value  I love my work and feel good about it  morality wise  which is not so easy to find in the legal field   and most importantly  I'm able to be available to my kids   Like  my work situation hasn't changed at all since I quit  but my perspective on it is completely different   21 days was a mental milestone for me  Here's to one more  I will not drink today I will not drink today  Thank you  This is perfect for me  I already turn to Reddit when I'm bored or frustrated or in any way looking for a distraction  Having all of this wonderful advice and support is so much more than I ever expected to find   I'm so GLAD to hear  Thanks for the update   it's very encouraging   Hope today is a good one for you  I will not drink with you this day  I myself couldn't quit   If I 'quit' it seemed too permanent and a little scary   Plus  since in my head 'tomorrow' I wouldn't be drinking  forever  I could put it off one more day  because after all I wouldn't be drinking  forever  after that   I had to not drink today   I had to forget about tomorrow entirely  deal with tomorrow when tomorrow arrived   I could only not drink today   When I woke up the next day  I didn't drink for today that day either   I'm from Eastern Europe so I can say that I understand your point  You can't escape drinking culture  of course there is an emigration option    but it's kind of extreme      but what you can do is find new friends  Of course don't cut off old ones  Just find new friends which aren't so interested in drinking  or don't drink at all  Join or set up activities which doesn't involve drinking   Limit activities which are build around drinking  Will not drink today  Day 3  I will not drink today  I'm not going to drink today  The liquid of life stealing is not gonna get me today  because I don't wish to experience anymore pain and suffering associated with the damn stuff  I will not drink today  I will not drink today   Will not drink today  even though the urges were terrible yesterday  Keeping myself accountable and staying away  though  awesome  I will check it out  Ice skating FTW     That's why I have 2 kids    so I put on arm on each shoulder and use them kind of like crutches to get around the rink   Apparently it's easier to get them ice skating lessons than it is to learn myself   I too love all of the things I can do now that I'm sober   I don't have to worry about 'hurry up and do this so I can drink' or the activities I can't participate in because I have a buzz   What a great post   I won't drink with you today  You cannot change any of that   But you can start to define yourself as what YOU want yourself to be   What do you want   What do you want to achieve   How do you achieve that   The very first step on any journey is usually always the most difficult   But your options are actually simplier than you think   Do you want to be a person  in your own right  with your own feelings   Or do you want to live the rest of your life being defined by someone else   And actually  you don't need people to care at this point   You just need someone to give you the information  and the tools you need  to move forward for yourself   The rest is up to you   No one is able to do this for you  but they are able to offer suggestions that you might follow  Thanks    I had a copy once  but someone snagged it before I could read it  I will order another   I will not drink today  Relapsed over the holidays after a year  Luckily it wasn't too bad  but it was certainly headed there  Day 1  for the millionth time it feels like   Hey Lee   I really appreciate your presence and support on this sub for everyone else and me    That's a wonderful sentiment   At some point after I stopped drinking I started living   The two weren't the same for me  but one wasn't possible without the other    Haha this is awesome  I am just the worst at ice skating  but somehow every xmas I forget and end up hanging onto a wall to dear life trapped in skates while my friends pirouette around me   The small wins is what has basically made my sobriety for me  I started boxing  I own boxing gloves  I would never have done this before  but now somehow sobriety made me be like   I am going to do what the fuck I want  I feel like a total badass version of myself  I care so much less about what people think    On NY's day I walked 6 miles through sleet and hail  that felt like being pelted with rocks  along the beach and it was awesome  The small wins are all awesome   The best people talk fast  long and ineloquenty  Love this   Congratulations  I won't drink with you today  One week   That's fantastic  I won't drink with you today  I used to want to achieve the home in Canada  girl I thought I'd have for life  whom I thought I'd never lose  who taught me that I could possible be a good dad one day    But I lost that too  I definitely did  I had nausea  diarrhea and vomiting even when I didn't drink  in addition to sharp abdominal pain and pain under both sides of my ribs   Heartburn too  The only thing a doctor found was slightly elevated blood sugar  The longer I abstain from alcohol  the better all symptoms get  I decided to get ahead of the problem instead of waiting for someone to tell me I needed to stop   I've never tried LaCroix  Is it sweet  I like sweeter drinks  soda  juice  etc   as opposed to seltzers or club sodas Oh man  this one really hits me   I will not drink today  I will not drink today   I will not drink today  Thank you   Yeah  I have keenly realized in the last few months in particular that I can only control my own actions and my reactions to others'   Thank you Luv x I won't drink with you today  Westyman  I really like the story about your daughter  I think that's some of the best motivation you'll find for yourself  It has taken me about five years of continuously relapsing  and the relapses getting progressively worse and worse  before finally getting to a place of real clarity and resolve  Sad and frustrating but not at all shameful    Welcome back and with you sober today  Yep  thank you  I think this group will help  Been beating myself up and felt the need to talk to people who would understand  Hahaha   43 actually   Love booze  blow  benzos and weed   on their own or any combo   Apparently I'm not growing up anytime soon  I will not drink today   I will not drink today no matter what happens  good or bad   Sometimes a "dark" moment isn't our bottom but  maybe this is for you  Stay sober today and take it 24 hours at a time  The worst thing you can lie to yourself about is  "I can drink just one and I'll stop"  Like whoami cc said  there is help if you're willing to seek it  Thank you for the confession and I'll not drink with you today  I just might    for now I'm indulging in the cans as I have a theory there's a helpful placebo feeling to cracking open a new can     Also   how do you flavor your soda stream or do you not  This is the amswer  Delay  distract and ride it out  Good to have you back  Congrats on 3 days  that's huge  You should flair up  Haven't had a drink since Dec 29th  Started the morning on my kness  praying to God for another 24 hours of sobriety  Today will be a good day   I won't drink  This is great advice  I'm really struggling right now  I find the worst time for me and the time I crave most is when I wake up in the morning  I also am like you where I stop and then start again but I'm ready and determined to kick the habit for good like I never have before  Thanks for the comment  Truly laughing out lout   love your style  Congrats on 280  Gabapentin helps for me  but I have RLS as a diagnosed sleep disorder  so this is stuck with me for life  Even though my RLS is not withdrawal induced  I can attest to a few things that works for me personally  RLS is a bitch so everyone's responses to remedies are different and what may work for me may not work for you  Anyway  here goes   Epsom salt soaks  Fill a bath with nice hot water and dissolve Epsom salts  adding some lavender essential oil if you have some    Massage  Either have someone help you by massaging your legs  or wherever you are restless  my RLS can be in my lower back and arms as well as my legs   Or an electric massager on your legs can also help    Compression sleeves on your legs or compression workout pants can also help    Magnesium  b complex  vitamin D3  a good multivitamin  l theanine  etc  I find that keeping a good healthy vitamin regimen can ease symptoms   Yoga  walking  stretching    These are all some of the things that help ease the symptoms  They won't get rid of them 100  but it may help prevent you from going mad from the awful sensations in your legs   Best of luck    Thanks for the support   I promised her I would stop smoking 8 years ago and did    I'm going to head to the gym  then take my son to see Rogue One this afternoon  Should be a fantastic day of not drinking   Looks cool  Sleek   The "Dashboard Diary Progress Mission" toolbar looks off center though  but other than that it looks boss  I've relapsed several times after weeks of sobriety   Jump back on that wagon and go again   I understand that sinking feeling of self loathing   I'm on Day 3  we can do this    Congrats on day 3  You should flair up and show off your accomplishment  As for sleep  definitely common  I had a lot of trouble sleeping the first few days and still do every few days or so  I think in time you'll find it'll go away  I'm not a tea drinker myself but my girlfriend drinks herbal tea to help her sleep  you may find that useful to try  I too had a DUI    not a good time  But it serves as a real wake up call  Good luck and I look forward to seeing you around here   I use bitters or a dash of fruit juice or both  Will work on some sober new glittering blinging for you today   D So  it didn't work out this time   I hate to say it but you do not have the monopoly on good relationships  and even better outcomes   You are not going through anything different to what near on 100  of people go through   What is different for you is HOW you are handling it   Most people accept breakups as a fact of life and that  as painful as they are at the time  they are a fact of life   You appear to need some additional help in how to move on and accept what most people accept as the 'norm'   There is no shame in needing that   I was not good at handling breakups either     And more importantly  you appear to need that additional help so that when the next opportunity comes along  you are in a better position in yourself to really accept what is and be a better all round person   someone who is ready to deal with the good and the bad  I can see how that depresses you  sounds really frustrating  I hope that one day youll have some peace of mind  And I also hope that a doctor finds the cause for your wives vulvodynia and is able to get it cured  not just for your sake  but rather for hers  because I just googled it and it sounds like that disease is pretty uncomfortable even when your not having sex  Anyway good luck to both of you  See  You've got a track record  You've got this  Wow man that's amazing  They say the second day is the hardest  to feel that for over a week  I also don't want to replace this addiction with another and start vaping or doing something like that  I'm going cold turkey  I feel so much better when I'm not smoking and I know I'm doing the right thing but just when the cravings come that lil monster reminds me of the good times but I'm completely done with that  I'm never picking it up again   I am not going to drink today    I will not drink today   My bestfriend died of a heroin overdose  No one even knew she was using it  I hit the drugs hard after that and ended up taking 180 mg's of acid and had a psychotic episode ego death  I was sober for 6 weeks after  The longest I'd been sober since I was 14  I'm turning 25 in 3 months  Thank you    Fortunately I've put myself in a situation where I have no access to narcotics  Dealer is 12 hours away  lol  You can do it   I'm on day 6  so by no means an expert  but I keep thinking back on sloppy drunk me  a k a  the worst me  and tell myself I don't want to be that me ever again  Hey M  Nice job on going for some new flair  I won't drink with you today  Thank you  Much better to see the progress bars on the start screen  It really was the most important feature together with time count and cigarettes not smoked  Meeeeee    But some days I just don't know  True  thank you  Naw  three days and not being tempted are both huge ies  and we're proud of you too     x Welcome  Have you read This Naked Mind  It's available for free download on here somewhere  I just googled it  I'm about 1 3 of the way through and I am really getting a lot out of it  I will not drink today  Me too     Thanks  yes bringing health to the dashboard was a primary motivation  I love this quote  Also  to quote Scrooged  the thing about regret is it's never too late  Let's make the years ahead of us count  It's a new day  and so is tomorrow  and the day after that    You get my point  You've still got this  I won't drink with you  Happy day 1  Good for you u any other   I am so very pleased that your life is different than it could have been and that you found what worked for you    Looking forward to many blessings in 2017   and I will be more awake to find them cause I'll be sober   Adding one more to the count  I won't drink today     FTZ   Awww   but Zippy  you JUST PUT glitter and bling in my day      xo   there does seem to be a correlation with booty loving and heavy drinking  that just explained my life When you go pornfree you hit periods of time when your sex drive vanes  these are called flat lines   To me they were a blessing   Because they helped get longer streaks   As you go on being pornfree if you do not lapse into porn fantasies   over indulging on sex   The drive slowly vanes   Someone here said years ago "porn is like aerosol fuel for lust"   It is true     Mo is OK   I try to do it once a week   But right now I think for some reason I am hornier and I have to go up to maybe once every four days   It is a fine line between love and hate  Mo too much and you r tempted to do porn   Mo too little and you begin to have dreams which tempt you the same way   Finding a mo schedule for that keeps you from being too horny is a must   I am not drinking with all of you today   I will not drink today   with you  They can ask if you'd consider rehiring the employee though  Anything other than a yes could be interpreted as a red flag  The are some tricky ways employers can get the information they seek without asking questions directly  Congratulations  Precisely   Wooow  I've not heard anyone mention The Cult in forever   I used to have a dub of the cassette of "Love " heh   I associate their genre time period with The Church  whose anthology I've been revisiting a lot recently   I'll be a Sweet Soul Sister and not rink with you today  Thanks   On one hand it helped me get pornfree   Congrats on day 2  I won't drink with you today  You're very welcome  I'm very happy to hear that     I was going through the FAQs of this sub  and came across this page  which I found very helpful for times like these  https   www reddit com r stopdrinking wiki bored  It was so fucking good  I thought that show was on game of thrones level of good I agree fully NonnyMouse   It does take some time for trust to re build  even in oneself  but it is really great  It's great to see so many new people jumping on the better life bandwagon  Welcome  I will not drink with you all today  Thank you The Futurist        Do you think you can quit using without any outside help  I know you want to help everyone  but you cant  Don't let people's addictions or mental problems stop you  If you even help one of those addicts then your patience and kindness is worth it  Keep your head up and don't let them wear you down  Thanks for caring  Indeed an awesome start to 2107   Thank you   I won't drink with you today either    Thank you  Happy New year to you too   Thanks for the comment    Thank you   What a lovely comment  especially about being proud      Have a wonderful day   Cold turkey is difficult  A lot of people wean themselves off things before dropping it completely so if you end up lighting up  have half of it  The taste is rotten and it only strengthens your motivation because the only thought in your head is  "this is horrific"   I was doubting whether I could go through with this new years resolution  it wasn't my first attempt this year   but on day 3 I'm feeling more confident already    By now I know for sure that at least I won't be drinking today  And I must say checking in  having a badge  and especially having you guys here  helps tremendously  thank you    Every day you remained sober you succeeded  Your relapse does not mean you failed and does not invalidate your sober days  Forgive yourself  stay sober and strong   You can do this  I had a reset relapse fairly recently  and my nightmares last night had such Dolby level audio hallucinations of someone smashing up my porch and staircase that I would have called 911 if my body had been able to wake up to do it   It'll get better   Takes time for the chemicals to work out of ye olde grey matter and get back to normal   You'll get there   Your fiance's support is an additional blessing   I won't drink with you today     Thanks  and congrats on reaching over 150  First few days are always the hardest  I've been changing my habits slowly and hopefully they become permanent the more I progress  Sober since Jan 1 and I went to my first meeting last night   Will not drink today  Thank you  It is an awesome feeling   my niece is like my other daughter  so she deserves the best of me too  You can do this  Forgive yourself and realize that 53 days was amazing but now you can do more      Really   I feel like it's been pretty busy this week   Maybe it's just me  Sign me up  I beat December 2016 and want to keep going and winning  I won't be drinking with you today  Thank you and yes   the super powers   I hope that these types of feelings carry on    to about 911 days      Best wishes pmtallestred  One question we've got  u nootopian and I built Smoke Free  is whether you'll miss having more than one figure visible without scrolling on the dashboard    Welcome   We have all been in there in some way or the other   Atleast this was an "a ha" moment for you and you are doing something about it   I will not be drinking with you today   If I may  try reading the Naked Mind   it is helping me so much  Thank you      I also think polar is far better  I won't drink today no matter what  Cool   and we can rock on   Thank you      Thank you      Thank you      Thank you      There is an Irish guy on YouTube named Kevin OHara who has a channel called alcohol mastery   He talks a lot about pub culture and drinking culture and how his search for individuality relates to not drinking   I have found a lot of his stuff helpful even from outside the culture   Maybe there is something there for you too   I believe he also has a website by the same name  Thank you      Thank you      Thank you      Thank you       Happy New Year to you too     Hey man   Thanks for the kind words   If you're new to meditation  I strongly reccomend trying the headspace app   The first 30 days are free and give good  clear guided instructions on secular mindfulness  in my opinion  the most important tool you can cultivate to start exploring   One gentle reccomendation I have at the beginning is to not bite off more than you can chew   Daily practice is super important  again IMHO   especially early on   So  maybe start out doing ten minutes a day  but every day  and see where that takes you   I'm absolutely not qualified to give further advice on this  but why let that stop me   Meditation is completely free and requires no equipment   At some point  if you become super enlightened like me  you may have to buy a pillow to sit on     What it does require is a set amount of time each day   Recovering alcoholics are good at this kind of thing   We do daily maintenance  and  our brains are becoming more curious  pliable  and bright as sustained time sober gives space for the fog to lift   In any event  set a timer for the amount of time to you intend to practice  maybe 5 15 minutes for a beginner    Sitting comfortably with your back straight in a chair or on the floor  take a few deep breaths and close your eyes   As you close your eyes  allow normal breathing to resume through the nose   Take some time to pay attention to your senses   What do you feel with the sense of touch   What do you hear   What do you taste   Smell   Not naming the objects themselves  but just focusing on your experience of them   Once you feel settled  gently bring your focus to the breath   Once you've done that  begin counting breaths from 1 10   Count each in breathe and our breathe separately  paying attention to the breathe   Is it long  short  shallow  etc      Not judging or changing  just noticing    I recommend starting your counting on an out breathe as I tend to get lose focus after the out breathe but before the in breath    When your mind wanders  and it will   gently bring the focus back to the breath   Rather than chastise yourself that your mind has wandered  you should be happy that you have discovered this   Mindfulness has returned   Gently direct your attention back to the breathe   Thoughts will come and go  but when the do  observe them as you would children playing a game   They are there and are amusing  but you aren't playing the game with them  just noticing when they are present   You can even gently note to yourself "ah thinking" before gently returning to the breathe   Do not get up until your timer goes off   Did I mention gently  gently  gently for the way to approach this   Just learning how to talk to myself gently instead of harshly has been maybe the greates gift of meditation for me   Nobody beats on an alcoholic worse than the alcoholic and it is not constructive     Stay vigilant   Alcohol is a cunning foe  Thanks    yeah I love that show Huh  I wouldn't have even realized that if it weren't for you  Thank you    Secret  I'll be REALLY excited when the Palindrome has a '6' in the second digit    I know  one day at a time    Lots of Love  your maniacal groundhog as a wingman NASCAR driving road rage loving friend  LOL   i think this is incredibly important  realizing all the things you gain from quitting  mainly your freedom   I'll join you all in not drinking today  It's a poison and I don't want it in my body making me incapable of handling life  I could not get clean after Suboxone until I went to jail    Something in our brains just doesn't click    I wish you God's speed   It is true that there is progress even with relapses  But the thing about streaks is that they are all possible beginnings to that streak that does not end   Ie to truly quitting porn   Just lowering the amount of porn you watch may suit some but that is not doing pornfree   That is porn sometimes   That is 207 to 167 pounds   Nice job   I went from 220 to 167 pounds in 3 months myself  Not drinking today    Yeah it pisses me off  They don't knzow why I had the seizure  Company policy  Supposed to get rested today  but thwy're holding ke in the hospital  so   Yes  you're right   I'm quite sure that I have more out of a 3 am trip than she did  I'll tell her how important it was to me when the time is right   Thank you      Just remember this as a lesson  alcohol doesn't make you feel better   You got this  And they don't shout get out you piece of crap so that makes it loose it's power  next week I must share one more that I've kept a secret    Thank you  friend  You're definitely right  weed was making it hard to take any kind of action and improve my situation  I've been stagnant for years and my depression has only gotten worse because of it   I remembered my first dream in years last night  granted it was a nightmare and I woke up covered in sweat  but it's still exciting for me lol  I haven't had a lucid dream since I was a kid  that's a cool goal to look forward to    Thanks for the encouragement  it's hard doing this alone when all my friends smoke     You're awesome   By the way  I meant to ask you how you're feeling  Are you on the cane  I think of you often and hope you're OK     xo Thank you    so much      Still here  Still clean from Kratom  Messing up in other ways though  fav  passion fruit least fav  mango   i also do mango iced tea and peppermint hot tea  and  coffee  omg  coffee  Day 16 and I am sick as hell  Fever  sweats  bad cough and incredibly sore all over  Is this normal or is this actual sickness  Furthest I have made it so far  Going to keep going  Not today  i had a dream my cat brought home a dead pelican the other day    i live nowhere near a beach and have never seen a real pelican  dreams are fucking weird yo I will not drink today   Maybe I am just too fucked up to notice  Chairs fuckers  don't get too upset at a drunk fuck    I've found the sleep thing to be a process indeed   Once you strip any drugs from the brain  it suddenly has a whole bunch of info up in there to process   Some shorts and blown fuses are bound to happen   Hang in there    everybody's body is different  but it will get better in your own unique time       I think OA does stand for something in the context of the show  I haven't gotten that far yet     I'm glad you came right back Johnny  From what I hear about antabuse  I think I'd be terrified to try taking it   even after 9 days  But even though you didn't get sick from it  you're getting back on it and resetting  kudos for getting back on track   Let's continue and kick some ass now     That 53 didn't go away  "It didn't work out this time "  I've been abused in at least 3 of them  man  I have been through hell in my youth  I'm going through hell right now  I just     I just can't do this anymore  I can't handle life  I can't handle going through having a broken brain  a back that can't handle 15 minutes of lawn mowing  I can't handle the crippling loneliness  the horrible job  the god awful family life  the past that's still fucking haunting me  I've hurt people for a living  I used to HURT people  man  Call it surviving out of necessity  yes I was blackmailed into it by shady folk  but it still haunts me and the only thing that makes me grip to life  the only thing that assures that I won't hang myself and just wake up the next morning is alcohol at the moment  I've got nothing and no one but a subreddit that's trying to talk me out of fucking ending my miserable existence  I've started to believe that it's just too much to ask for me to be unconditionally happy for once in my fucking life and it's killing me  Sorry for writing all this so openly and shit  but I've just    Stopped    Giving a fuck    I don't even care who reads this anymore  I'm done hiding it    Choking tears to "be a man" and all that    I can't do it anymore  I can't  almost 46  and at my very healthiest of my adult life  it feels so good to feel good  40 days is amazing  keep going  What a great read  Your year ended awesome  Thanks for posting  I'll have to shop around for some melatonin as well   I've read and heard much good about it  and I do need some sort of natural sleep sedative in my current chapter w o crutch ing into OTC or street drugs   Thanx for the reminder  Thats a great story    and so nice to have fun all night dancing with ginger ale   My family does rely on me for things  and now i can do so much more if I am healthy and less stressed out   Plus    each one of those favors to my nephews or niece equal one visit when I am really old    They've agreed   and they're in it for years now   but who's counting      JK I suggest you read what I wrote to CThreeEurope on my current situation    It's kind of a big read and it's just the start of all the shit that's driving me off the edge  Kroger brand tastes like it has more carbonation  Also has a little sodium  LaCroix doesn't   I can't believe I've been sober all year     Jokes aside  I will not drink with you today  I am excited for this year   Get a hobby pal   Can you draw  paint  skate  run  cook  Garden  Sculpt  Game  Lift  Yoga  Bike  Rock Climb Or learn  learning is what has helped me in the past if I am stuck in a rut  Ask your self some of the big questions  if you do not feel you can answer some all of them see if you can find a way to educate your self to    How old are you  Who do you live with  Do you have partner  a car    This is wonderful iDoneDo     At 45  regret that I've wasted a lot of time and energy  but looking toward the future is the only think I can do   I will not drink today  Thing is  if you're anything like me  this may NOT be your darkest hour  For me  every "darkest hour" was followed  sooner or later  by a an hour even darker  There was and is an ultimate darkest hour  of course  and that is death  and or its first cousins dementia or long term incarceration  Where I come from we call those "yets " and I have a list of those as long as your arm    As long as I played footie with this thing and let the disease tell me "you got this" and "this is the worst  it's all better from here " I kept on that downward process from one "darkest hour" to the next    I haven't solved the problem  but I've arrested it on a daily basis through participation in the fellowship and program of Alcoholics Anonymous  For that  and for people like you who remind me every day of where I was and where I could easily be again  I am grateful  Good luck  Won't be drinking today Ok so u got 5 years on me  glad to see over 40 ain't end of the road  I will be there soon enough  Been drinking vodka since 13 back in mother Russia  I wish I could just smoke weed  would be much healthier and productive  But coke and booze is just so much more fun Most of the good stuff is in the comments anyway   Plus I was BO drunk all NY day and so when I came to yesterday morning I felt like there was a plethora of posts  Oh yes  thanks   I also like to hit refresh on this here daily check in all day and read what all the fine folks have to say   And peruse new topic posts  or even poke around old ones   They just never run out     SD is a great sub where to hang out  the only truly 24 7 support group I've ever seen     I remember the first few one month streaks   In many ways they were harder than this current streak   I will not drink today and will be kind to myself   Good luck my friend  I will not drink with you today   I hope CBT works for you too  because being depressed sucks   I hear a lot off good things about it   Before I went to the doctor I posted on a what's up Wednesday here that I knew how to be an alcoholic  I didn't know how to be a depressed person   It was a little overwhelming   I think the medicine is helping me  but who knows   In any event  I exercised  meditated  didn't drink  etc   basically did all the things for depression people tell you besides take medication and none of it changed the anhedonia until the medicine started working   One day I just sent my wife this super depressing text from the copy room at work and I read it and I was like  this just isn't right   I don't have the troubles in my life where it's appropriate for me to feel this way and bring her down  but I was hurting so badly that I couldn't keep the feelings to myself   That's when I decided to try something different   Huge congrats on your year  I had very bad PTSD for years  I often assumed that  once it was resolved  so too would be my relationship to booze  Turns out I was wrong   my PTSD is pretty much entirely resolved and my drinking just kept on getting worse  So  alcohol wasn't the original problem  but it sure did persist  sticking around to assert itself as the big  central problem  in time   Plus  maybe remember   an "alcoholic" doesn't have any magical metaphysical status  It just means someone who meets a certain set of criteria  I think the idea of the "alcoholic" is totally bogus  but  I absolutely meet those criteria and  even more so  absolutely cannot drink due to the havoc it has wrought on my life   Belated congrats on the 200 days  Not drinking with all of you today  Damn dude  Your post brought me to tears  You prison analogy is spot the fuck on  I know that I am now "free" from the addiction and now its my responsibility to start doing things  Thank you for the kind words  I think it's up to you    I personally couldn't have any cigarettes around me at all as the temptation would be too much  especially in the first week  In fact I threw my last few out as a motivator  to start again would have been to waste the money spent on those thrown out  considered my payment to quit    tenuous  but helped in the short term   Others like to use their last one  or their last pack  or whatever  as motivation to prove that they can do it   Just chuck them and be done with it  otherwise they'll always be there  and you'll be stuck in a loop  that is  smoke what you've got left  run out and say "I'll quit after the next pack" only to find yourself buying more     Best of luck  Thanks man  I really needed this   I'm so glad I found this sub  I can tell it's going to help a lot   I'll be here reading posts every time I feel I need to smoke   Best wishes  friend  and thanks again for the kind words    do it man  its worth quitting  I recommend reading the book "this naked mind" and also Allen carrs "stop drinking the easy way"   These books will help change the way you view alcohol  For many moderation does not work   I will not drink today  I might    I mean  I took the steps to reach out    There's that much  So I might follow you to further steps  And what you wrote is precisely why you should talk about this to someone who may not give a shit about your personally  how many doctors counsellors do you think give one iota of actual personal care to their patients lives   but who are specifically trained to HELP you get started to recovery   Oh  and I am not trying to talk you out of anything   I am an accredited alcohol and substance abuse counsellor  but as I mentioned above  I have no personal interest or concern in what you do  or don't  do   THAT is your decision to make  not mine   All I can do is give you the best suggestions that I can make    Whether you chose to follow them is your decision   I won't lose any sleep over whether you do follow or not   I hope you do  of course  but if you don't  it doesn't affect me   As I mentioned before  you will be given lots of suggestions on this subreddit  but whether you chose to stay stuck where you are  or actually get off your ass and change something is entirely YOUR decision   I hope you do actually find someone face to face to help you  because there is a life out there for living   You will not find that life posting online  You got this I will not drink with you today  therapy I basically spend 6 months or more in a year blowing my nose every few minutes  but I very rarely get a fever or actually feel sick  I think its not really anything to do with my picking  if anything it has made my immune system better  I think I just have a large mucus production in general and it escalates in wintertime  Tough it out   That happened to me for months after I quit   Now I only see nasty shit for good reason   If I'm sick  or after a sneeze attack  etc  Cool  Well thank you for your post today  I got on here to reach out for help  too    Join me  don't follow those steps  We'll do them together  That story really hits home with me  Last July I went on a "vacation" to Colorado  All we did was get high  to the point to where it wasn't even fun anymore   Anyway  I know that group of "friends" are planning on going again this year and I doubt I will be invited  I already have stopped seeing my only friend in town  Not really by choice  I just never make the decision to ask to chill   He smokes daily  but gets shit done   I hate being "that guy"  who says "I quit" and fucks up rotation  passes the joint awkwardly without hitting it    That makes me just want to not go hangout with him anymore  So I don't  I sit in my room alone  instead  check  will not drink today  Thanks for the encouragement  I am 44 too  It's only been a couple of days and I don't feel great yet  It helps to be reminded that it gets easier  Keep it up  The hard thing is to try to be OK without porn  With me it means anti depressants and complete change in my lifestyle   I feel really bad for kids growing with porn   To me porn ceased to function as a numb all at age 36  middle age started    I was dumbfounded   People think you can keep on doing it   Deal with your problems through it    That is not true   The brain can not keep on pumping ever increasing amounts of dopamine and serotonin after watching porn   Slowly  like any drug   It turns to a curse   You have to learn to live without its comfort blanket   Just when you probably need it most   Only some Mio drops have caffeine   Most have vitamins and electrolytes   I monitor for the same reason you stated  That's awesome  Good job  Thanks for the kind words  it means a lot to me   I have definitely heard of weed hijacking your dopamine and other related hormonic receptors  it's just every time I try to quit the pure boredom and dissatisfaction with general life is so crippling  But you're right  I need to suck it up and just tough it out  Because honestly I'm still bored and dissatisfied even while smoking  Stay strong  I'm going to try to anyway I take your advice to heart  apologies if it sounded like I was rejecting you  but like mentioned before  I don't have the best family life  I fairly quickly feel like I need to explain my point of view so I'll be taken seriously  Keep up the good work   Its a huge accomplishment   Yeah I sure found that out  I got this  thank you    I got two weeks until christmas  then i caved in  I ended up deciding to stop after new years  and not drink in between  I ended up with only 2 sober days between christmas and new years  that wasn't the deal I made with myself  But now I am back on that horse  Best of luck to you my friend  you are not alone     This is fantastic  See I don't like peach pear  It's too sweet  I like apricot though   good  You're right  I do need abstinence  It's just when I think of not smoking forever  it truly makes me depressed  That's pretty annoying  like marijuana never used to mean this much to me  You're analogy with moderation was excellent  it is mocking  I fall for her every time  Thanks for the kind words  and stay strong Irish too here  There are a few of us lurking about on here  Sometimes it really does feel like its everywhere and everyone drinks    But not everyone  And actually since I got sober  I notice more and more  Its just a bit hard if everybody is off to the pub every weekend  Myself I still go to the pub occaisionally at this point and don't drink   but that's v much personal choice  What about other ways to socialise  Cinema  bowling  caf etc  I just noticed more options opening staying open late but depends where u live  I also got a lot into running and took up a new hobby unrelated to drink so that helped to give me non drinking social life It took about 14 days for me to feel better  I drank a ton of water and slept ten to twelve hours a night  I used melatonin as well  Worked pretty well for me  I'm 47  You're not alone  It's amazing how people say they feel like crap because they're getting older when they're drinking every night  But we found the secret  I'm in   Gym and no booze no matter what  As dark as your day was yesterday  you can make today a good day  You can be the father and husband that you want to be today  It's incredibly hard to take that first step  but you're doing it  I'm proud of you  Sucky Sucky  Zippy  Maybe he just used that excuse as an easy way out  Either way  eff him  Sorry you have to deal with that added stress  Internet hug from your old pal  Cheeser   Ah only in Day 2  happy to hear on your progress definitely needed to read something like this   It's okay  I didn't think that    Just trying to explain to you that talking online is one thing  actually taking real life steps to improve a situation is another   Unless YOU put the action in  one way or another  then nothing will change for the better   Use any  and all  suggestions you receive   But make sure that you do actually go further than just reading and nodding and saying 'yeah that sounds good     I'll do that tomorrow'   Because the chances are  you won't  You were not wrong and frankly neither was her father  Reaching out to emergency services was absolutely the right thing to do    I'm not sure if you're part of an al anon group but I'd suggest looking for a group to speak to or talking to a therapist  This is a lot of stress for you  You can better help her and yourself by taking care of yourself   I'm hoping for the best for your friend  I'm so glad you were there for him  Thank you for the support  I will not drink today  Thanks and i will not as well  I'll not drink today  I completely relate to this   I never told anyone while I was taking kratom or during withdrawals   I was mortified that I had this habit   I put on this persona of a normal  health conscious  self controlled woman  and yet here I was sneaking to my bathroom three or four times a day to drink this powder   Ugh   I HATED myself for taking kratom  and I hated myself more for hiding it   It wasn't until well over a month after I quit that I decided to tell my husband   I had enough confidence in myself and my quit by that point to let him know   It was hard   He wasn't disappointed in me  but he was disappointed I had never confided in him and that I'd gone through it all alone   I think it's up to each person if they want to tell anyone   I was very close to taking the secret to my grave  ha ha   This forum has been an invaluable place to be totally honest   Could not have quit without these people  Just checking in to say I'm still here  D Just checking in to say I'm still here  D Like another redditor said  I took the first step to admitting that I have a problem  I took the next step  reaching out  now I just gotta keep this trend of taking steps going   You really helped  man    Thanks  I'll try not to pull the old "one step forwards  two steps back" deal a lot of people fall for  Throw them out  It makes it harder to start again when you have to leave the house and go to the store  Congratulations on going and taking those first steps  I'm sober with you today    You're looking for justification to keep smoking or justification to quit  cause once you get out from the fog of addiction  there is absolutely without a doubt not one single damn good thing that smoking does for you  fact  Hey  you and I must have the same illness     There are some wicked bad colds flus going around   I think at Day 16  you probably just have a regular  old fashioned cold   Hope you feel better   It's all I can do to get myself out of bed with the amount of coughing fevers sweats going on over here  Doesn't seem like there are too many folks who enjoy their first meeting   Good for you  Woke up feeling good  I won't drink with you all today  Day 2 for me  after a long long time     I will not drink with all of you today  Thank you for the support  I love this  A few times in AA I'd hear people joking about hitting a "soft bottom " meaning that their turn around point wasn't as devastating as others' turn around points had been   I don't like the idea that you have to lose everything to know that drinking is hurting you  I don't have to wait for rock bottom to hit to know that I want to change  and I can change   I completely agree with you  Quitting weed would be a whole lot easier if I woke up each morning with ambitions  and a plan of attack for the day    Instead  I dropped out of college  Two years ago my group of friends disbanded me  they were really garbage people anyway   and now that I quit smoking my only "good guy" friend and I don't even hang out anymore  It sucks  Now I wake up with a "lets do this all again" mentality   I wish I had something to fill my days with  Something to look forward to  I live at home  and have no friends  I feel like a total bum  A pot smoking loser  minus the pot smoking part   Where can I go to find ambition  I am interested in many things  but picking one and moving forward with just one seems impossible     If you're not having physical withdrawal symptoms by now you probably won't have them   However  your brain chemistry is not normal if you've been drinking daily for many years as you say   That'll likely take a few years to normalize  I will not take drink today As I look forward to my 4th month I will not drink today and instead I raise my voice so all of you around the world can hear   Have a health  happy and sober new year      Congratulations  I also went to my first meeting last night  Very glad to see you felt the connection  Missed my early morning meeting today so checking in to state that I will not drink today   Throw them out  Hell just threw out a half of a pack yesterday morning  Even soaked them in water before I did  It's best to just keep them out of sight  At least for me  The first week has always been tough  "Red 182  standing by "  Just made my first account to support and participate    Edit     SIGN ME UP    Today is the day for sure not drinking today  Day 3  here we go  I will not drink today      edit  I actually put Day 2  instead of 3  because that's just how out of it I feel      I will not drink today   Will not drink today   iDoneDo   Love the quote   Thanks for this   Perspective I need today   Not drinking today   No matter what  I will not drink today  Grateful for my sobriety  last night had to drive hubby to the ER after he took a tumble at work  He's fine  but a few years ago I would already have been on my third drink and incapable of being there when he needed me   You seem like an extremely awesome person  thanks for this post    Congratulations  I was pretty much sure my throat was irritated  because in the morning when I wake up the pain in my throat was almostly recovered and after smoking a few cigs the pain coming back and then I was spitting blood  the problem was related to cigs 100  and now is gone  If i was continue to spit blood after 1 2 3 months after quiet smoking then was for sure more than an irritation  You're young  You can stop it before it gets too difficult down the road  Just stop  Easy as that  Go for a walk or work out when you feel a craving    I'm telling you  I'm sure most people here wish they could go back and stop before it got out of hand  For me I started when I was 17  I regret it   Thanks for that  Smoking is filthy  FILTHY FILTHY FILTHY  That's a hell of a story  keep trying  never give up on yourself  Scottish  Irish on one side  Polish   Russian on the other  I hear ya  Holy alcoholism  Batman  I intend to buck that system   You are welcome and I very much do hope that you will keep moving forwards   Because you ARE a worthy human being  and given some time and some proper care  you will come to understand that too     Thank you  One day at a time  Thank you  Yay for your week  I won't drink with you today  I was thinking that could be an issue to  I'm on a high dose of welbutrin which inhibits neuroadrenaline serotonin repute  kinda makes sense that all those extra neurochemicals could cause a problem  The first dose I'm fine  but if I try to redose I'll get shakey  dysphoric and panicy  Guess there is a certain threshold I shouldn't pass while on Anti depressants while talking kratom   I will not drink today    Hi Eli   I've been hoping to catch this  do you know if I can view it online   Or  if you're in the UK  which channel it was on   Is it the one that has that lovely young chap in the coat   The one who left to go to the shop   Sorry if that's a big vague  trying not to give away too much  but I hope you'll know what I mean   Congrats   your list is very similar to mine  One day at a time  Keep in mind that you're a bum whether you're high all the time or not  That might make it easier for you   to see the grand scheme of things   Whenever I've felt stuck in my life I always went travelling for some time  I can recommend India even if you haven't traveled before  I know it sounds drastic but you know where you stand  It's cheap too  Perhaps it'll give you that perspective on life that you need to move forward  perhaps that coy smile of a bunch of kids playing with garbage on the motorway in India can make you more acceptable towards your current situation and where to go from there    Moving forward can often seem insurmountable because there are too many expectations from ourselves and those around us  The world is too perfect and I'm not  Less caring is always better    Never thought a guy with a Star Wars pun for an alias would one day be the one to help me get over my issues  If by crappy you mean "totally on point and useful " then yes  this is a crappy parable     It's a good lesson  this parable  for me as I head back to my intensely problem solving job today  "The parable of Cookietrousers1223 and the office chair "  I will not drink today  Second this question  if someone has found a decent one I would love to hear it  "Alcoholic" is only a word  and tbose that choose to use it must always diagnose and label themselves  There is no exact criteria that makes or disqualifies one as an alcoholic  Many find the word a helpful tool  many others find it offensive   All that said  I will pass on the wise words a friend said to me many years ago    "Never second guess your decision to get sober  You made it for good reasons"    I have removed your comment  It is not appropriate on this sub to tell someone to drink  i will not drink today  I had the same experience  It's so great  isn't it  Congratulations  Thats why people can resort to mouthwash and extracts  Honestly I have made the most changes in my life ever since admitting I am an alcoholic   Changes that have nothing to do with alcohol   I'm happier  I'm sometimes content and at peace  I enjoy things  I look forward to hobbies    all of those things because I quit drinking  and I couldn't have done any of those things without admitting I'm an alcoholic   So  yeah  I'm happy to be in recovery too  The grill makes me want to drink more than anything  I do see a lot of ppl posting about soda water though  Way to go  I will not drink today  I will not drink today  Thank you for all of your responses  I now understand how people relax without drinking   Hey you  How have you been doing   You're been to AA NA for a year so surely you have a sponsor and have asked him her this question   I'm really proud of you   Keep celebrating victories like these  keep focusing on the good   I also will not drink today  Back to work today  I'm not drinking alcohol today  At least for the next 24 hours  so until 7 19 a m  on Wednesday  January 4  2017     That includes this evening after work   Thank you so much for this  walking away isn't easy but right now I think it's the smartest and healthiest decision for ME  I've put him first for so long and he still doesn't see that he has deep issues that affect me too    and I'm tired of being a punching bag and I'm tired of feeling like my thoughts and emotions about what's happening aren't valid  Again  thank you for taking the time to respond to me in an honest yet kind manner  it's good to know that this isn't all in my head   Neither will I  Go to the ER please   You could die from this  I don't believe that to be true  and I don't think we benefit in lying to ourselves     Lying to ourselves just gives us a loophole when we are at our weakest   Edit  just so new people to the thread know  this comment has been both positive and negative  got a controversial sign  and lost it   So this isn't 6 upvotes  it's a lot of upvotes  and slightly less downvotes   People tend to vote on votes they see  without regard for thought or  reddiquette   wiki reddiquette   so I just want you all to think about it     I'm ok with people disagreeing  as long as they think  this edit was at 6 upvotes  and controversial symbol gone  I had this same experience   Went to a few AA meetings at treatment  stayed sober for 8mo but didn't change anything in my life  went back to drinking for a couple years   It was never the same   I too think it was the guilt and shame of it all   In retrospect that was some good guilt and shame to have  I squeeze out lemon  lime or orange wedges  I think the feeling of a carbonated drink hitting the back of my throat was the placebo feeling I loved most in beer or soda so taking a big gulp of carbonated water really helped me with that  So refreshing    Yep  exactly that one   It is on Apple itunes here in Australia  not sure if it is in the uk though  Easy way out crossed my mind this morning   Oh  and since the backyard terminal patient's  the love you letter we talked about giving her  sixth suicide threat  I've shut all my curtains and told the whole lot not to come around here anymore   I did work on that letter  and now I couldn't GAF to hand it over   Always appreciate you  McStinkster    Things could be sooo much worse      http   cheezburger com 50703105       One thing I wish I retained as I go further into porn free territory is this   Thankfulness that I do not have to struggle anymore with porn  But the truth is that it is still in my mind   I still dream about it    That is why I should not be too proud of my current streak   In the end   I am and will be a porn addict  Slowly recovering one but porn addict just the same no different from guys struggling to get to week   I was there once    I wouldn't   This looks great   Just a question  say I've quit for 30 days at the rate of 21 50 per pack   At day 31 there is a tax increase of one dollar increasing it to 22 50   Im assuming changing the price per pack in the settings would recalculate all the days according to the new value   If that is so I'd love to see that implemented as price movements in Aus are quite frequent   Anyway thanks for the great app   Worth every cent  Beers and wines are just carbs and alcohol  Lots of people get sugar cravings when they quit  Just don't over do it  Sugar can be just as bad for your body if you are binging on it   one of my sponsors used to say   relapse is a part of recovery  it doesn't HAVE to be  but frequently is  if you relapse   get honest  check   well done   get up and dust yourself off  check   seemingly   well done  and go back to not using   just for today   forgive the fucking appalling grammar sentence structure  I just got clean from opiates a couple weeks ago  was JUST feeling okay again and BOOM chest infection  not slept last night at all really   we all want you to succeed  each and every one of us in this community  you're doing the right thing as far as I can see  a relapse is a mistake but is NOT the end of the world  You put it back    at two weddings j got so wasted I started walking around to tables and started drinking people's drink in front of them  Really pissed of my family  You got it man  I'm hoping to the gentle start to the week as well  I assume it's an office environment  I find them so artificial and many of people do not look healthy  I do what I can to break it up   lots of water  going for walks on breaks and standing as often as possible   Good luck  Right on  I apologize for the controlled drinking idea  just something I've heard elsewhere that's worked but forgot all about the sub rules  You have the right attitude  to never stop trying  never give up  You want this and you can do this  We're all here to support you  Good work on 3 days  keep it up    I will definitely do that  Thank you   Enjoy the drive  thank you    and best wishes back to you  you wonderful human being   also  why does your u name ring a bell  is it just cos it sounds faintly german and i've been listening to lots of rammstein  or is it a reference to something i've since forgotten  I've lost count of the relapses but here is what I have learned from them   1  For some it is part of the process so I start over and I resolve to be stronger this time   2  Each time I figured out what triggered the relapse so as to avoid a repeat incident   3  I learned to use some tools   I play it forward  my most often used tool  and ask myself what will tomorrow be like  who will I hurt today  what dangerous actions will I take   4  I educate my self as to what alcohol does to my body and mind   I know now it is a poison  a carcinogen  it's addictive and it will kill me   Good luck   I will not drink today Great post  Good job  This resonates with me on so many levels   What precipitated me finally leaving alcohol behind is I realized that    Alcohol   Me   Undesired Consequences   Those consequences were in various domains  mostly  spiritual  physical  relationships  and emotional   I recognized that there were other domains and it was only a matter of time  if I continued my patterns  until they would be impacted  legal  financial  career  professional  and marital    Meanwhile  the first four  were experiencing increasing effects  worsening      So  I could replace in your example Problem with Undesired Consequences   The more I examined it  the more I became honest  the more I evaluated what was actually occurring to me  and around me  I came to recognize and accept the underlying problem  or root cause      I was   Impaired     Now  early in my experiments with alcohol I was of course actually  purposefully seeking to become Impaired   Just to experience it   It took many years for me to realize  acknowledge and accept that Being Impaired is an Undesired Consequence  or Problem      I came to understand that when I was Impaired  I was numb  unavailable  escaping  and I was being   Dishonest   and a   Thief     Whoa    I would never have characterized myself as Dishonest nor as a Thief    Yet  I was      I was dishonest about being present with others  especially my family   If I was numb from several glasses of wine  I was not fully and consciously engaged with my loved ones   I was indulging my inner self centeredness   I was a Thief in that I was stealing time  emotional presence and my conscious self from the people around me   Yes  being Dishonest and a Thief   is   a Problem   Being Dishonest and a Thief is an  Undesired Consequence    Being Impaired is selfish   I choose to be conscious and Unimpaired   Thanks for the informative reply  Great information and well thought out  I'd like to suggest that complete abstinence from food  fasting  is  equally  if not more beneficial than exercise as it is shown to regenerate the immune system  repair DNA  cause autophagy  create new brain cells  reduce Alzheimer's and Parkinson's  and much more  Beyond that  the spiritual and emotional effects are just as profound  but more difficult to discuss  Same here  Thanks  Congrats to you as well   Speaking of "one day at a time"  this song is awesome for kicking a habit  https   www youtube com watch v 54ewauMmBHc I'm 38 and in the same boat   I'm not sure I would have made it to 44 with all that happened to me this last year   We got this  I haven't gone back to the regular cans since I first tried the Crate ones  Cherry Lime and Apple Cranberry are my staples now  It was difficult for me at first as well because my friend and I live together and made our own smokes so the supplies are always there because she's still smoking  I don't have any extra advice than reminding yourself why you're quitting and choosing a healthier more rewarding activity when you get the urge to have a smoke  Wishing you the best  Welcome  You've made a great decision to better yourself and I'm proud of you  Remember  you are not just the mistakes of your past  Forgive yourself and keep putting in the work to be the better person you want to be  Do this for your current and future self   We're all here to support you   Very concisely put The "allll year" made me laugh out loud   Congratulations     "The bottom is when I stop digging" and for each person it is unique to them  I will not drink with all of you today  Great job   That star looks great   I think it's awesome that you can already see an upcoming event that would trigger your drinking   Do you have any plans to get through it   Sharing them may help us all get some new strategies  Excellent point  Sorry  as much as I do like Star Wars  I don't get that     Do you mean as in C3PO   I've never thought of it like that before   My username is the charity that I run to offer free alcohol abuse counselling to those that need it  If I could upvote this a thousand times  I would    I could chase my own happiness  and celebrate no longer trying to find a way out of my life  but through it   You just kick started my day with joy  and the smile on your face at the rink is ineffable     I'm saving your post for a day I'm just trying to get through  God yeah   PAWS I think is where I'm still at  It's supposed to get better  I keep telling myself that  and I know it will  It's just tough  Plus I started working at a hospital again  I'm a nurse  and I'm swimming in dilaudid right now  Such a cruel joke The coconut smells so good but it tastes so vile  "I don't see myself quitting smoking  but I can decrease it further"   That's the weed telling you that   I can relate to everything you have posted  The honest truth is  if you want your brain to return to its "normal function "  you have to give up the chemical compound that interferes with its function "normal function" now and then  Give up the weed  Not cutting down  not smoking now and then  Give it up   I'd recommend adopting healthy habits  if you are not exercising  get into it  Even if it's running just to break a sweat or basic body weight workouts  Also engage in mentally stimulating workouts   reading   solving word puzzles or playing video games  The idea is to get your brain working  instead of getting it stoned and dazed with weed  Eat healthy and keep telling yourself you can live and be awesome without weed  "Best possible version of you " Funny how instead of shooting for that we usually view ourselves in comparison to others and go from there   Also appreciate your observation on "the stupor" that clings after you are still functional but not nearly at optimal the day after drinking a six   In the same boat you are   Don't drink every day but could easily get there if things took a weird turn   Thanks for the observation   There's no need for us to hit the proverbial rock bottom when operating below the optimal to begin with  90 days today  Look at that pretty 3 star  Proud and excited  Not drinking today  Yes  I might buy a variety of citrus and or juices to try in plain seltzer  Good idea  Awesome Stuff   Well done and yes  onto 2017   That's the way to do it  regardless of how you did it   One less person struggling is the goal       Tell that to the ones telling other around here to take stupid high doses  This is true    apart from all the negatives  the only thing smoking does is satiate the brain's craving for nicotine  And the only reason the brain is craving nicotine is because of the previous cigarette  I like apricot  It's a very neutral taste  I have not tried mango yet   Oh  I didn't know that it was a charity  I thought it was kind of a play on words with C3PO   Where can I find it  Sometimes you have to take a break from the situation even if it means cutting off contact with a loved one  Your sister sounds like mine  and as an older sister it's hard because you're caught between being a friend and a parent  at least in my experience   But that's the thing  as her sibling it's not your job to be her parent  What you can do is be there for your parents or just dismiss yourself entirely for a while  It might sound cold but it'll give you clarity and sanity  because if there's one thing I've learned with alcoholism is that the person will make the changes when THEY want to  You can be there for them 24 7 or ignore them 24 7  and the outcome will be the same  It took my sister getting into an accident  drunk   high  to realize that this addiction could kill her and others  Thankfully nobody got hurt and now she's on probation with her license suspended  But for the first time in years we're on our way to being cool with each other and it's amazing to see all the progress she's made in such a short amount of time  Keep me posted on the situation and I wish you all the best   Not really sweet so much as flavored   https   www reddit com r stopdrinking comments 5l35jw swapped

Without it   There will be less of it   But that is a good thing   Porn charged lust is not lust for you   It is lust for porn or porn situations   Right there with you    This resonates with me on so

If that were true  the first few cigs that we ever smoked would not have been enjoyable   Some enjoy the taste  for others is the chemicals alleviating stress   I'm not trying to paint smoking positively  I just don't want people to beat their addiction on a weak foundation  Half Irish Canuck here  An interesting thing I noticed was that I was always near the center of the heavy drinking culture that I used as one of the reasons I drank  It turns out that not as many drank as much or as heavy as I thought  When I stopped going to pubs and liquor stores and spent time with sober activities I found that there were a lot of sober people doing things without alcohol involved at all  Yes  tbis did mean making choices about who were really friends and who were just enabling drinking buddies  Looks much better  but why do I now have to upgrade to get missions  Just thought I'd ask    I can't do coffee in the evenings because of the caffeine but I do like mint tea  I have not tried the passion fruit or the mango so I am excited to have those to look forward to  Truth  Being high and being a bum only makes it easier to accept that I'm a bum  In fact  I've realized that giving into smoking is synonymous with me saying I am ok with my current situation  That's what I always did in the past  I'd smoke whenever I was feeling this way  then for an hour or two I would forget my problems  Classic addiction playing it's tricks    Thanks for the response  I'm going to stay strong   Apricot all the way   Then look no further then your mirror  I will not drink today  We

offer free support and counselling remotely  via skype  and you are welcome to chat to me  We are UK based  But in terms of multiple issues then I would still maintain that face to face support would be better for you  It is important to be able to distinguish that some remote support can be good  but in some cases  there really is no substitute for a more in depth support system being set it place   And no worries  as I say I am a fan of the Star Wars movies   Even worse  I am old enough to remember the original from 1977       You are young  Way to make this decision now  And her complete douche nozzle of a boyfriend    They were all sad stories   I couldnt believe the South African trying to rationalise the odds of living past three months  I could have written this myself  Thanks for sharing  This is awesome  I will not drink with you today  I'm sober today  Thanks for posting the check in  Thank you for giving me your honest opinion  I agree and feel that I should go to more  I am working on finding childcare for one addition weekday and at least Saturday  if not both sat and sun  I really didn't want to admit that I need that but I also realize the part of me that doesn't want to make the time is the part of me that doesn't really want to admit that I need to really try to be sober  It's a work in progress and I'm still learning what will work for me  I haven't admitted to my parents that I have a problem and my boyfriend son's father isn't very supportive so far of my attempts at recovery and it's been very difficult to get him to watch our son on weeknights  But  I think you're right that I'll get out what I put in and if I want to put in the minimal effort then I'll probably get minimal results  Thanks again   I had about four tablets of 5mg Valium  People poo pooed my microdosing  about 1Mg at a time  But the only real discomfort that I felt I couldn't tolerate was my heart rhythm feeling out of sync  This is probably some sort of anxiety symptom as my heart has had plenty of attention from the docs and it's just fine   I count Valium as a number one remedy for WD from kratom  But I'm a junkie at heart  so I had to be extra careful with it   Oddly enough I noticed recently when I ran out of black seed oil that my heart started up with the same nonsense  So  even though I have some arriving today  I went out a got a bottle  It fixed me right up  putting BSO at number two on my list of remedies  Quite effective for latent WD and much safer than Valium  Damn you have perfect taste in music  Ever seen thee oh sees live  Hey  You are not alone   If you search my post history you'll see that I was deeply entrenched in a recovery program  lying to everyone about being clean and sober  including my boyfriend   No one had any idea that I was using anything  everyone thought I had 6 1 2 years clean and sober   I ended up getting honest about it to EVERYONE and picking up a white chip about 7 months ago   It was terrifying but also the best thing I've ever done for myself  I'm finally free  and you can be too    TV in dad's country is pretty explicit at night  loads of sleazy old 80s "comedy" films   Got bad after I set up his satellite TV so he could watch his stuff over here   I was browsing through and found a phone sex strip channel which I slowly watched more and more  I was like 10 11    Eventually I set a PIN on the box with my eyes closed  in hindsight  ridiculous idea in case we ever needed to change settings  and I stopped   Internet stuff   I mispelled a search term on YouTube and it came up with one of those weird mashups of video clips from around the internet  one of which was from some trashy internet channel interviewing a Playboy model   From there I worked through YouTube  Dailymotion and eventually onto blogs which linked to "proper" porn websites   I checked a few years ago   most of the videos are still around but the original sources are long gone   Always felt conflicted because dad's side totally normalised the softer stuff  but mum's side was pretty conservative so I was always rationalising my behaviour with the former yet felt guilty due to the latter  Rad  I'm super pumped to see someone else doing the tri fecta quit on here  If we're gonna get cravings  might as well kill 3 birds with one stone  I quit caffeine  weed and alcohol 5 days ago and I feel like pure gold already  The first days were hot cold sweaty shivers  nausea and sleepless nights  but I'm already over the hump  I'm not shooting for 30 days though  my goal is permanent  Let's do this  I really like that quote  It's something to aspire to  Thank you so much  Congratulations  Lol  me too  It's become clear to me how important it is to learn  something  from each of my mis steps  And also  to strike the right balance between chastising myself and acting like nothing happened    b c neither of those extremes is helpful    So if I were you  I would examine really closely why the cave happened  and try to erect some defenses against that specific event or trigger  Then there's one less leak to worry about  in theory    I'm not drinking with you today  Thank you for your opinion  I am going to try to make at least one if not two more this week  It might not be my only recovery tool but it's worth really giving it a good shot   I forgot to mention that my mom was mildly active in AA  She would attend meetings  but it was never consistent  I'll definitely check out that sub for some more advice  Thank you   I think they are sweet  not syrupy  but have a hint of sweetness  I like the lime  Bigquinting your way to success  Naice Thank you for the input  Sounds very similar to what I'm going through   CRAZY ROOMMATE STORY I was living in a house full of drunks at the time  because it was that or be homeless  I've got my husband and my kid and our crazy fucking roommate  Roomie is a drunk fucking musician  Instuments everywhere and a tv in every room and the tvs are always fucking on  He wakes up shaking and downs a case of beer every fucking day  Can't steal any  He'd kill me    Well mother fucker goes and moves his not even girlfriend  a friend who is a girl who he also fucks sometimes but he won't let her sleep in his bed  he moves her in without fucking asking us or warning us or shit  She is a pill head but not really a black recluse spider bit her knee off and her spine is fucked so the docs feed her pills    Long story short we had to move out because it wasn't safe for the baby with all the fucking pills and when I said hey fucker its that pilled out bitch or us he said well you fucking kick her out then and she wouldn't leave and that is why I had to move out of my dad's after moving back in  My dad was the best and craziest roommate I ever had  by far   If only I had thought to get sober over the holiday I probably would have had more time  But I will put in the effort  Saturdays and sundays might be good days to shoot for since people seem a lot more willing to watch my son on weekends   Good for you  Yeah  those bad days seem so unfair  but they do at least get less frequent  Also  I have to constantly remind myself that I had bad days when I was taking kratom  All the time in fact  Congratulations  I'm 8 days in since my last binge and I finally feel pretty good  Also if you just started working out  that will wear you out quickly  Maybe give it a few more days and get as much sleep as possible  We beat our bodies up for years   so it makes sense it is going to take a bit to feel better    Also  one thing I noticed in myself is that sobriety period after each relapse is different  Some better than others  Hopefully this will be the last time either of us has to go through this   I was much better when I was only smoking weed   I was a functional pothead   It was fabulous   At 40 I discovered vodka and stopped smoking pot   This was a mistake     A very big mistake  It's great to want people to have a strong foundation  but the best foundation is to educate themselves about the addiction  Whyquit com has some excellent articles   especially "Nicotine Addiction 101" which explain the addiction   Physically the only "stress" smoking relieves is the stress of craving a cigarette  We subconsciously place that 'relief' onto relieving all stressors in our lives  Look up the Easyway   I think Allen Carr explains it well    Also  surely no one likes the taste of cigarettes    it's a combination or peer pressure and social aspects which makes smoking attractive  particularly to the young  And once we're addicted we convince ourselves that we enjoy the taste  Also check out Noah Levine and his work specifically in Buddhist recovery   "Refuge Recovery" is his book and there are RR groups around the country  alas  not in my area  although I may start one   Dharma Punx amd Against the Stream are the name of his other books  I don't know how old you are  but he has a very fresh take  but grounded in strong lineage  There are other ways to deal with anxiety and depression  But it may take a few days to detox  You can talk to a doctor if you're worried about the detox feeling  You may feel really down while you detox but it is very temporary  Good luck  we are all rooting for you  Uh oh  Wanna talk about it   My first couple of weeks clean looked like a renewed spiral into alcoholism  It didn't last thankfully   So  what are you getting up to  Ahhhh fuuuuuuuuckkk  I already exercise  and read tons of books  As I've said  I've got an objectively successful and functional life  I'm just starting to pine for that mental sense of control   So I guess it has to go    Good point  It's amazing how much time i could spend on drinking  However  I could drink while my son was tucked away in bed upstairs  And I can't do that with AA  I do think I need to demonstrate to myself  as you said  that my sobriety is important  Secretly trying to stop on my own hasn't been working because I always give myself a way to backslide   Seriously  the guy was a grade A douche  I hope you made it  Day 10 is right around the corner     AA is made up of a microcosm of the entire society   There are all sorts of rules and regs which various people adhere to or not in the society as a whole   The great thing about AA is that there are no requirements for membership except a desire to stop drinking   In my experience with a bunch of years of sobriety  those folks who put together any sort of long term sobriety are those who work the steps  including making amends   However  the only person I can judge on this is myself    Peach pear tastes like old lady perfume   Pamplemouse and Lime are my go tos  I will not drink today  I will not drink today  One of my favorites   Jack Kornfield is fabulous  Another favorite    "Reflections on a Mountain Lake" by Ani Tenzin Palmo  And always    "Start where you are" by Pema Chodren  Perfect for recovery work   edit  added Pema I am with you all in not drinking today   cheers to the Lacroix I had a bad illness two or three weeks clean  I believe it was just a normal cold or flu  but without my self medication it really sucked  Just the kind of thing a normal person might hit kratom for  It only lasted a week though  and in an odd way was a somewhat pleasant break from craving kratom  as weird as that sounds  I guess my earliest experience with porn was looking through my buddy's dad's playboys when I was 12     internet porn wasn't readily accessible until digital cameras scanners and early broadband in the mid 90s   I'm 44 now  and the driving force  the moment of clarity  was a stark realization that I was wasting valuable hours that could be put towards more productive use   Also  I was trying to feed a craving in my brain that was never satisfied   I have a 16 year old daughter  and I had the realization that I had already pissed away thousands of hours looking at porn when what I really needed to be doing was getting more engaged as a father  an employee  and a friend   I mean  I stopped looking at porn every day for decades  swore it off completely  and went straight back to it as soon as my head needed another hit   I'm not saying I have it licked  or that I'm cured  or anything at all really  other than I've been able to go 28 consecutive days without looking at porn   It's been pretty good   but i have to remain vigilant   What I'm looking forward to is my brain becoming normalized  where I can focus on the here and now and the real and mundane without worrying about an endorphin release  congrats  you're not alone  i think we're all here because we hate drunk me     I will not drink today    I am a little behind you with 237 days free  All I can say about your post is yes yes and Hell yes  You're a spring chicken to me    I'm 65 and I am totally enjoying this new road I'm on  Enjoy your new path   Im a month out since my last shot of ice  I love being sober but to be honest  I love this memory as well     I think you are both sort of correct   In the past I enjoyed the relaxation of sitting on my deck with a cup of coffee and a smoke in the morning and the sensation of smoking after a big meal  That was not necessarily just the relief from nicotine   Unfortunately the handful of memorable   pleasurable cigarettes per week come with the hundreds I would smoke purely to feed the monkey   Congrats on 30  Woooot  So happy you're still here   I haven't been very active on this sub lately but still actively working a program of recovery and feel great   I'm going to try to get on here more often to give back what was given to me   I made it through really intense cravings yesterday  If they show up today I know I can make it through    I will not drink today   Just keep pushing and the craving eventually fades once you develop newer patterns  I quit in July but smoked all through December  quit again the other day for the clich resolution  Seems easier this time  in July I was a mess haha  Good luck buddy I will not drink today  First day  Yesterday a woman offered to go to a meeting with me this week and I'm going to text her and take her up on it  I can do this  Welcome back  You've got a good plan to start  but I wonder what you will do in a couple weeks  I used periods when I was motivated to make plans for when I wasn't  like a couple weeks in  Moderation  right  So many times i have told myself  this time will be different  Ill just have the one  Nope  that has never worked  I will not drink today  So    what do you think your next step might be   Are you willing to go try an AA meeting   At the first one I went to  they asked who's a first timer here   I was embarrassed  but I raised my hand   A while later  they gave me some pamphlets and a piece of paper that 10 people from the meeting had written their phone numbers down on to call for help with my next step   I left soon after the meeting was over and bawled my eyes out once I got to my car   I couldn't believe that so many people would help a stranger like that   If I've learned one thing about the community of folks fighting for our sobriety  it's that we can count on each other for support   Do you think you could start by looking up AA meetings where you live   Or would you prefer to start with a counselor    You really can do this   You just need to take tiny steps in the right direction each day   It won't be easy  but neither is the crapioca pudding that comes with our drinking  Hey  congrats on your 24 hours    I quit extract too  not an easy job  so good for you  Well done groovycassy   Thanks  King  I have been o happy to be on this journey with you and I love your post   I'm reminded of how important these posts were for me last year when I found SD    the stories to take me forward   Your post inspires me to think about Year 2  ODAT  of course   I put off some things decisions for Year 1  wanting that to be my priority  It's time to address them now   Thanks for being here  What if instead of thinking of yourself as a failure or a screw up for drinking  you forgive yourself  move on  and resume not drinking   I think it's a kinder way to look at it  Hey I'm with you  I'm big on not seeing the forest because of the trees  or is that reversed   Trees and chair arms be damned  Isn't it nice to figure out something so simple  Donuts unite  I'm not drinking with you today  Irish 44F checking in  and I live in a very large Irish town  When I got sober  I felt that the best way to stay that way was to make necessary changes to my lifestyle  That included ending some friendships and not going to certain places anymore  It was interesting to see how many people I know and have met that don't drink  are sober  or are normies  In my experience  I didn't need to become a recluse  I just needed to adjust to dry people   dry places   Sober me is a ball of anxiety who is often in a bad mood  Drunk me is someone sociable and happy and confident    You and me both  But as I've spent more time with sober me  especially in social settings  I've started to understand how cool she really is  I'm quieter  but I'm a better listener  I'm more aware of what's going on around me  which helps me relate to people in a more genuine way than if I were my tipsy self  And while I'm still often anxious  I've gotten used to relying on healthier coping mechanisms than reaching for wine  The most useful of those for me is simply knowing when it's time to leave  and making a graceful exit  Then I go home and be anxious at home  where no one but my cats can make judgements   Congratulations on making it to day 2  and I hope you have a similarly good experience getting to know sober you     Have you seen anyone for the depression and anxiety  Working through that was and is still key in maintaining my sobriety   As for the gym  are there any classes or programs you can sign up for  Having a gym partner or study buddy always makes me more likely to actually show up  Same if I had pre paid for some sort of classes  almost an obligated feeling to follow through with it   I've lurked in this group for about 6 months now and did some dry stints last year but December was a blur and I'm ready to do this   This is my day 2 and today I will not drink   Edit  wow  I didn't realize I've been lurking in this group for over a year now   Just goes to show how much of your memory is blurred by this poison  I second this ping     Congrats again u YoungIrishSober     Spot on   As Allen Carr puts it  just like heroine addicts   I looked for an easier  softer way   will power and whatever   for a long period of time   I went to an AA meeting once and they started talking about higher powers and I walked out as I was not going to have anything to do with those "Jesus freaks" as I perceived them at the time   I hung out on the streets for another six months  and then I was back at AA and went into a 30 day detox program   I can tell my own set of horror stories about the things I did while drunk   Fact is  when I got sick and tired of being sick tired  I stopped just wanting to get sober  but took proven steps to accomplish that end   When I went into detox I made two commitments to myself   First  I would not lie and second  I would do what I was told   That is my experience with getting sober   Andt hat was on August 4  1984 and I have remained sober ever since  Mirrors are a trigger for me too  as is stress  Have you considered wearing gloves when home or getting a fidget ring  The thing that helps me is practicing mindfulness and avoiding mirrors unless I'm putting on makeup  I also recommend hydrocolloid bandages  They're great for keeping your hands off of any blemishes  You can find them on amazon for pretty cheap  I just buy big ones and cut them to the size I need  You can use them on spots you've picked or spots you want to avoid picking  Practicing better skincare has helped me too  Not only does it lessen my chances for an outbreak  big trigger  but it makes me feel more invested in my face overall so I'm less likely to want to mess it up  Check out r skincareaddiction if this sounds like something you'd like to try out  Hope this helps    Edit  grammar     You are exactly where you're supposed to be  There's all sorts of cultures  chinese  irish  student  small towns  that have drinking as part of their day   You don't have to participate if you don't want to   It can take some effort and planning   If you don't have alcohol issues  then you're in a good position to stop     I've been feeling really  bored  lately  Like  uncomfortably so  I have plenty to do  Work  read one of the two books I'm trying to get through  play World of Warcraft  clean the house  have sex with my boyfriend  prepare for my upcoming A P 2 class    none of these things I want to do  Boredom is a huge trigger for me  Then again  I am about to start shark week  so it could be hormones PMS messing with my head  Still  I'm kind of scared     Edit  And today is 60 days for me   On day 4 here also  Feeling just as amazing too  Best of luck and keep it up   That's a bit of a silly question  I'm sure some people on here would say "no" but the majority would say yes  Marijuana is a depressant Yeah I agree I had those feelings too   but we place that enjoyment on it   it's not physically giving us anything but relieving the craving  I find found it very useful to strip back the sensations we place upon the cigarettes and just view the addiction for what it is   an endless cycle of needing to smoke because we smoked  Oh my God frozen cake is manna from heaven     That's a big deal  Congrats  It sounds like you're in a spot where pure determination is your best guiding force  It sounds like you're surrounded with heavy temptation  and that's a huge challenge  Just think back to a time in your life when you needed no substances  and maybe try to meditate on how you are still that same person  Find strength in knowing that you've been sober and felt fine  I'd also suggest exercise as it will quicken the pace at which your body and brain rid the THC and return to homeostasis  I'm guessing that you're a dancer  I actually drink Polar brand  though intend to pick up some La Croix sometime  My favorite flavors are cranberry lime  pomegranate  and grapefruit  I also love the mango berry flavor  but it seems to be a summer seasonal  I'm also a huge fan of the Bruce Cost pomegranate hibiscus ginger ale and GT's gingerberry and gingerade kombucha  Cool   5 days   Hope to see you around these parts for a long time to come   Definitely will not drink with you on this 3rd of January  2017  Just asked to reset the badge after almost 90 days  You open the door a little bit it can become a mess really quick  The hardest thing I've had to deal with over the past three months is my run club meets at a bar  Run Club has been instrumental in improving my life over the past 2 years  to the point that I decided that putting drinking behind me is the best  most worthwhile thing to do now  I don't want to stop attending this club  but the casual drinking culture going alongside it  I don't know if I can be near it at the moment    I'd already made my mind up that I was going to drink again on Christmas night when I drove around the city looking for an open liquor store  I was saved by Colorado law that for some reason singles that one day out of the year that liquor stores cannot be open  But Thursday night after our little group run at run club  I sat up at the bar and made the decision  I got a little tipsy real quick  and didn't care for it  I've never liked being around other drunk people  now I guess that includes me    Nevertheless  the drug does its job  and a couple social drinks turns into a weekend binge that ends with me still wanting to drink on Sunday night  and having exhausted my supplies  I walked to a bar in my pajamas at like 11 30pm  Such silliness  It's a select crowd who's at a bar near midnight on a Sunday  I guess I'm in that select crowd  The drinker's brain is finding a little romance in it  honestly    Of course  that ruined my Monday  The day off for New Years was spent recovering on the couch  I got a little run in and a trip to buy dog food  but I couldn't muster much more energy to battle the fog    Thankfully every day is new and every moment is a chance to make a better choice  I'm not going to drink today with all of you  I told my sister that my drinking was a problem  She replied that I didn't have a problem  just a lot of opportunities  I laughed  but realized she just didn't see what I knew  Keep up the good work  Not drinking with you today  Besides admiring your scanties  I'm taking my book down the local tonight for a few civil  quiet pints  Time to break from the masses a little while  and I think am certain the barmaid fancies me a bit   The fuck  I read every single entry and I don't recall any of this good shit  I have a very short attention span though  If I'm not intrigued by the first few sentences it's game over  I had that at the end  Heartburn  acid reflux  vomiting  beer bowels   Time to stop  If the body is expelling it  the Bodies telling you you're hurting it and it can't cope   first two weeks quitting make me way more depressed  after that its okay Been smoking 12 years  i quit for like 2 weeks and you're right  the dreams man  Not even the content of the dream but how REAL they felt    Wish i had some advice but all I can say is they happen to me too   I'm 22 also  you sound exactly the same as me  I wish you the best of luck  we can do this  What a great way to turn something bad  fracture  into something good  sobriety    I like the way you think   For what it's worth  things got a little easier for me each passing day   Please let us know how your next days go   Today   I will not drink with you  I tapered down to about four grams per day and stayed there for weeks  It was such a misery  I had mailed my four oz  stash off to someone  and eventually just had to decide to jump when I ran out   Those low doses were barely beating back the WD's and really only for about an hour  when I was dosing every two hours  So every day was a misery   I eventually ran out and was forced to step off   couldn't really call it a jump at that dose    The thing is the "jump" was totally easy  The first thing that happened was my cravings completely changed and diminished  Instead of spending one hour out of every two in five alarm craves    they just fell away   Youre pretty awesome for beating the trams  and now kratom too  Just WOW   Awesome  Thanks  Yes  I've done that  I think what has made it so incredibly tough is that I've  always  been in a process of "quitting" really since day one    The big thing for me really is fear and avoidance and being confronted with life circumnstances beyond my control  Cigarettes create both an immediate and a psychological sort of pausing and  a sense of distance  A calm before the storm  It's an infuriating psychic trap because I've obviously been through it for so long now that I can't possibly convince myself it is effective any longer   Today is day three of my commitment to a year of sobriety  as I read your list above it spoke to me and I added  self deprecation  isolation  sneaking  hiding  denying and keeping distance from those I love   I am ready to leave those negative behaviors behind for good   Thank you and I will not drink today   I have  I am about to again on Saturday as well  The comments  Its in the comments  back to day 3 for me  I had a small hickup over new years and went and used for like 3 days heavily  Kinda feeling like shit today as expected  Had 16 days but went and threw it all away  gotta dig my self outta this slump  Thank you for the advice  I have found a few key reasons and plan on making this a stim free year  With this sub and these great people being part of it   You slipped up and got right back to staying smoke free  thank you for sharing that  I think you're strong for being able to realize what you really want even when temptation was filling your lungs  Jeez that's a long time   Rad I saw them a couple months back  One of my favorite live bands  I think they recently separated with the second drummer  forget his name   Have a blast    I'm saying you can't quit games and constantly be waiting to play games after the detox  It doesn't work like that   I'm still standing  after all this time   28 days   Don't want to experience the guilt  shame  and remorse of 4 Mondays ago  That sounds delightful   Especially the part about flirting with the barmaid   I'm on a self imposed booze break   I'm feeling post holiday pudgy   Just got back from a two mile hike in the snow and now I'm hitting the elliptical   Well my PO would probably be happy about me not drinking too   I think that might be a condition   Lol  Chairs darling   Have a great evening  I feel you bud  Its about the same for me  I get to work and since I really don't like what I do for a living  my mind begins to wander  The hardest part is that I sit at a computer for 8 hours of the day  where the internet is not protected by any sort of firewall or blockers  so it takes all of my will to not begin to browse at the things i shouldn't   Stay strong  Focus on anything else  You are better than your vices   Soda Stream is a great addition to a recovering boozer's kitchen  I will not drink today  We really do have some great mods    I always read the comments but sometimes they're worse than the post  Sometimes they save it  Worth reading though   Some random little shit fuck told me my comments are cancer  They are in that they grow on you    Fuck this horrible cesspool of a sub though it was better before it existed     the pain of quitting is less than the pain of drinking  This   Once I really embraced that truth for myself  things started to change for me   Before the pain of quitting was enough to make me drink   Now I see the cravings and early physical withdrawal symptoms as my dues for becoming a member of a club that I very much want to enjoy    I'm here with you guys I will not drink today no matter what happens good or bad  Blessings on his  and your  journey  HP  Go to a meeting   You're off to a good start by actually DOING things instead of drinking  most people don't do that in early recovery    they just sit around saying either   1  I hung out at the bar drinking soda  I want to drink so bad  sobriety sucks  you are all dumb  2  I sat at home doing nothing  I want to drink so bad  sobriety sucks  you are all dumb   The problem  IMHO  is that you aren't necessarily replacing drinking with something in equal level   at the present moment  Don't get me wrong  you're doing great things  but they  obviously  aren't fixing the underlying reason to why you drank  and therefore are unfulfilling   Exercise  et al  are great to fill up  time   but won't fill up the   need   that led you to drink  I WILL NOT DRINK TODAY  That's just great   Keep doing what works  I beg to differ on the "first few cigs would not have been enjoyable"    I don't know anyone who didn't have to  work hard  to get used to smoking cigarettes  Remember that very first drag  When they told you "now  inhale the smoke"  Your body reacts violently  you cough  your throat hurts  your eyes water    there's nothing enjoyable about it  By the time you "learn" to tolerate it  its too late  you're hooked on nicotine     There are no chemicals in it that alleviate stress  there's nothing to enjoy about the taste  c'mon  it tastes like shit  there is NOTHING positive about smoking  Everything is a lie you tell yourself to keep on smoking  I did that for 30  years  I always thought that I enjoyed it and that it helped me in a bunch of ways    it does not  As OP says  "The only "enjoyment" a smoker gets from a cigarette is temporary relief from the discomfort created by the previous one " 1  Get to Al Anon   There is strong Al Anon all over Houston   Go to at least 6 meetings before you decide whether it is for you   Remember that the 2nd meeting is the hardest to get to because your brain will tell you that they are too old  too white  too brown  too young  too whatever  too christian  too new age  and that they don't talk about what you need   2  If after 6 meetings you don't think it is for you  go to 6 more and 6 more and 6 more because if your mom is alcoholic then you can use the help Al Anon provides   3  It is good that you have come up with some alternatives   You have many more   You will discover that with Al Anon help you can find contentment and even happiness whether she drinks or not   4  No one knows how to get people sober    If they did  believe me they would do it   "Tough Love"  aversion therapy  treatment have all been sold as foolproof   There is no fool proof solution  except an alcoholic embracing AA and working the program day by day forever   Al Anon has a similar solution for you and your sister  work the Al Anon program a day at a time and find contentment   5  You didn't   Cause   the alcoholism  You can't   Control   it   You can't   Cure   it   6  Alcoholism is cunning  baffling and powerful   Generally an alcoholic can help an alcoholic in a way that no non alcoholic can   Good luck  You and your sister are not alone   There are people all over Houston who are waiting to help you for free  with no hidden agenda   Good luck   If you go to Al Anon you will find solutions that work for you   No one knows what they will be  I will not drink today  You can do this man  You'll be happy that you did  The good things in life are difficult  and smoking is easy  I smoked for over a decade multiple times everyday  and I love weed just as much as you  I'm on day 5 of quitting and I feel so much better already  it's completely worth it  I honestly have zero desire to go back to that foggy haze I was paying to live in  Getting high was becoming more irritating than enjoyable  with the coughing  loss of self confidence  and waste of time money  Your spirit wouldn't be telling you to stop if it wasn't the right thing to do for you right now  no matter how much you love the herb  Do what's hard  and give it up  The plant has served you  and it is time to move on to your next chapter   You are in a difficult situation   Your mother is making decisions about her life that you don't agree with  She is also willing to accept any help you offer    I discovered with the help of Alanon that the alcoholics in my life would take everything I have and then demand more  The hole in their soul created by alcoholism cannot be filled with anything I have  They will keep taking till there is nothing left    In Alanon meetings I hear other people's stories an I can learn from them   Instead of getting their advice  I can hear their experience  Then I can try the things that work and avoid the things that don't    By doing the steps with a sponsor  I learned to detach with love  I learned where the line is between my stuff and their stuff  And learned how not to cross that line  and how to avoid being pulled over it      First day back at work after the holiday  I'm not drinking with you today   Today is a week for me and I know it's not easy  I have quit too many times to count  but we just keep trying and hope it sticks  I'm feeling confident and think 2017 is going to be the year for all of us  You got this     I appreciate the input and I know what you mean when you describe how you used to enjoy things more  I used to get a "high" just from having alone time or reading  playing guitar etc  Weed is so sneaky I  The ways it consumes your daily rituals   I know   I actually can't believe the help and support and it's defeneltly what had got me through the first day  I'm going to try AA tomorrow as kids won't be home and I do t want to spend the day evening drinking as usual  Alcoholism is such a lonely life  Good luck with all you do  I wish you the best x  I think you mean the benefits of  stopping  smoking  I will not drink today  no matter what   Cold be damned  I feel better now than in my drinking days  commuting to work   One hour in the car for my overactive brain to work  Thanks VP   same to you   If it's any consolation  I did five and a bit miles running today in full battle dress  That's about an extra 60lbs  I went easy  and obviously minus SA80   Took just over an hour  so a nice fireplace  some beer and a pretty barmaid are well in order  I really felt the French woman could have been me  Requested a badge reset  I am not drinking today  I will get through day one  again and pick myself up and not be too hard on myself  Onwards and upwards  Thanks for sharing this day with me  I have been a wake n baker of high grade for 30  years  so obviously I am older than you guys but my experience is still relevant to yours   I am on Day 8 of my quit and the worst is over now   I am FIERCE in my quit   I am just as stubborn at quitting  nothing is going to stand in my way  as I was in my love affair with weed  nothing would stop me from smoking      I am still low on energy and motivation but it is coming back   My stomach is sensitive and will still only allow me liquids and good hearty soups but I am not nauseous just picky as hell   My anxiety is through the roof though and I am quick to anger   I am dealing with that with help from meditation  lifestyle adjustment and lurking and posting here   I look forward to reading on how You are doing on Your Quit   Keep posting   Keep coming back and tell us what You are doing that helps  I look forward to Your updates  Not drinking today  Have you thought of going to your doctor and asking about sleeping pills  I'm sure your symptoms will go away in time and using sleeping pills for a short period could tide you over   I know a lot of people use weed to sleep but wouldn't do pills but I would give them a go  I've had great experience using sleeping pills from time to time I've found they make my sleep a lot more refreshing  o shit we get stars at 30 days   Thank you   Your story really speaks to me   I was never physically addicted to alcohol  never lost a job  housing  and so on   But I can only have one or two drinks with a massive effort of will  and I was often hungover and under performing   I think people worry too much about "Am I an alcoholic " and not enough about "Is alcohol negatively affecting my life "  There's no law that says one has to be an addict to cut alcohol out of your life    If the label alcoholic is helpful  use it   I'm not trying to tell anyone how to be sober or live their life     I've just past hour 100 on a three week relapse after a 25 day clean spell CT off IV junk  I'm really hating life right now  Everything hurts as expected  Feeling so hopeless even though I have so much to live for  I'm trying to stay positive so I'm on here reading and feeling a little more hopeful with all the success stories  So thank you   Thank you for asking  I am still using the cane but will see my doc in a few days  How are you  It has to go bro  I am also quite astute and was highly functioning when smoking  Was a daily smoker for over 10 years  I'm at day 4 and learning a lot about myself and the grip she holds on us  Let it go bro  let it go   I'm 26 too  and have been smoking for 10 years  I quit yesterday and it's hard  and I don't like it  but the knowledge that I won't end up like my grandma who is going to die from her emphysema related breathing difficulties keeps me on track   You are not alone OP  Keep going  don't panic  and know you are more than a little white stick  I resonate with this  It's the 'death by a thousand cuts' scenario  I know I'm a better version of me when I'm not drinking   Thank you for posting  I will not drink with you today  omg melon pomelo la croix  It's cantaloupe and grapefruit flavored  IT'S AMAZZZZINGGGGG       Thank you this gives me hope that once I can cure the alcoholism the suicidal thoughts will lessen and hopefully disappear  Hope life stays good for you Frodo well done in what you have done    Most successes depend upon whether or not the addict wants to detox or whether it's involuntary  Involuntary is understandably harder to endure since pain is multiplied by resistance  Such patients must be made as comfortable as possible or as allowed by protocol   Many addicts are used to controlling their pain  They micromanage their intakes and so they expect their expertise to be given proper due  Many are shocked and hurt to learn otherwise   As in all cases  those suffering and under stress respond to kindness  Detox is intense psychologically as well as physically  Self esteem plummets and horror sets in good and hard  Anhedonia and pain can indeed became practically unbearable and people consider suicide  aka relapse as a good option  This too is understandable   Why not maintain those who do not want to detox on a non euphoric  long lasting option like Suboxone until they are more psychologically able to endure and overcome the rigors of horrible psychological and physical pain and get clean   Why not maintain those who do want to detox on minimal doses of Suboxone until they can be cared for by appropriately trained professionals   Why do a half assed job and not adequately deal with peoples' pain when the situation may actually be quite workable for all concerned when it comes to safely and sanely putting off detox opiate addicts at hospital for other reasons and being treated for other issues  Thanks for the response  Really appreciate you taking the time  I won't be drinking with you today  its not that i dont quite know what to do with myself  right now im at a point that i can't do anything with myself  i cant really spend money or go out till i get a job and i cant get a job till i get the proper documents  in the process will take weeks   i moved to a new place so im not living in close proximity to any of my friends so going to see them would cost money too which i cant spend right now  i definitely see your point with the dog metaphor and probably the fact that i am in a state of uselessness is what is making me think about smoking  ill be living the hermit life for a few weeks  it sucks I can definitely relate  I only have 1 2 glasses of wine a night  and not every night  and can go weeks without  but still I came to the conclusion that even that amount was stopping me from being my best self  In terms of physical health  headaches  stomache aches  not sleeping well  feeling sluggish the next day  not wanting to exercise   in terms of spiritual life  not wanting to meditate on days I drank  not being clear minded etc    No trouble at work or with relationships  just the feeling that booze was becoming increasingly detrimental to quality of life   Worse was last fall when I found myself looking just a bit too forward to that first glass of wine  on days off from work wondering if it was too early to start  obsessing about when I could have that first drink  then not wanting to stop after 2  Developing a tolerance and not getting the buzz I wanted after 1   I have alcoholism in my family and don't ever want to go down that road  I too wondered if I belong in this forum since no one would ever call me a problem drinker  But I'm happy to be here and have now cut alcohol out of my life completely  one day at a time starting last Saturday  Keep your head up and aim for your goal of making it through today  That's it  And then same thing tomorrow  If you slip up  don't let that derail the train your on  Get back on and keep going forward  I have had to get back on the train more than I can count  but the train is still around and I am currently riding it into the sunset    Sorry for the analogy and metaphor  It is how I roll  I won't be drinking today either Congratulations   12 years deserves the respect of a sober celebration   Have a wonderful time  I feel you  I wish my hiccup was only 3 days  I went three weeks as I had to through the holiday season once I picked up again  Paying for It big time  You got this  I always thought if I could just make It a week  Then 15 days  Then 30  I haven't hit 30 in two years but I'm setting my sights on that this time  Then 60  Then so on   Yeah girl   Congratulations   You're a rockstar  fo' sho'  I personally couldn't 'moderate' or 'just have a few' or 'cut back' or anything else like that   If I have one  I have them all unless I run out or get cut off against my will   I tried going that route  repeatedly  and every time it ended up with me blacked out scrambling to figure out what I had done   Different people are different  though  Congratulations on the hardest week   You're doing great  Hey 2 weeks  great job   Oh cool  and hello from a fellow Aussie  all the way from London       I realised it must have been on free to air here  because I saw them watching it on Gogglebox     If you don't want t a spoiler   update  do not read on  but      I saw somewhere that the lad in the coat is doing really well now  he got loads of support as a result of the show   Bless him    why can't i be addicted to playing guitar or working out  haha   rofl Basically  It's crummy outside and I'm not feeling too hot  but booze would only make me feel worse  I'm not drinking today  Woo  You can do this Exact same boat  25  Irish  surrounded by drinkers  and addicts of other sorts   I wish I had some sort of advice for you  but I'm only on day two  Good luck  You can do it  As someone smarter than me has pointed out to me before  "there's no problem so bad that alcohol won't make it worse"   Welcome back  Way to go  Best of luckI will not drink with you today  yes  lets come to this board and criticize others' questions     Its not a silly question at all You made the same typo  u thesasquatchman made on my previous post  Now I'm suspicious   Fellow chaos addict here  I honesty don't know what it is that makes me want to self destruct every time things start going well in my life  I think it might be related to the fact that I do not think I am worthy of good things  even though I know I am   I will not drink today  Signing up for college classes today  just another reminder on why I want to be sober in the future  No drinking for me  I will not drink with you today  I will not drink today  Thank you  It was one of the biggest battles during the process  I felt at that moment I am back to day 1 when the temptation was that high I could barely think about anything else than smoking         You'll be alright  Maybe just take smaller doses and wait as long as you can in between doses  Or write out a scheduled taper plan and you will barely notice any symptoms if you do it right  Good luck You sound like me at 22   Except I turn 36 tomorrow  And today I am celebrating 2 full days under my belt  Again  But this time  I have been through some sobering  humiliating and eye opening life moments and I decided that I don't WANT alcohol in my life any more  God  I love a bottle of Marlborough  NZ  Sauvignion Blanc at night  but it's doing literally nothing but numbing me out and has shattered my sober self confidence  It's wasted my     replaced healthy food with empty calories  made me bicker with my SO  and then not remember things the next day so I don't even know who started it but I feel crushed that it happened  Again  It made my face flushed and dry  and usually woke up still numb from booze  so there wasn't even an opportunity to "get up on the right side of the bed "    No more    I wish I'd had the insight and courage that you do at 22  I was lost   Don't waste another 14 years drowning in booze  insecurity and isolation like I did   Bye Felicia to the wine  put that    in savings  make plans to travel  and be grateful for the life you've been blessed with   I will not drink with you today   There is some one for everyone  I found mine in the rooms of AA  Get help  Yes  I'll second this   What I've learned is that plenty of people from plenty of cultures are a part of this community  and a lot of them come from places where they feel a cultural pressure to drink   I think that no matter where you are from there is a lot of societal expectation to drink   As has been said  "alcohol is the only drug you have to justify NOT doing " I don't think it's caused by the detox  or rather  the effects of cannabis withdrawal have not been studied well enough for most doctors to give you any confident answer   Is this vertigo new for you  Either go to your physician and ask him to have a look  or first head to the pharmacy and pick up a ear wax removal system and try it out  I get vertigo every now and then and it's always cerumen build up that causes it for me  A rinse at home can be done over a few days and will relieve most cerumen blockages  and is usually a recommended treatment before removal by your doctor or nurse   It could also be the sign of an infection  issues with pressure or anything effecting the vestibular system  so if it gets worse or doesn't subside from the ear wax removal within a few days  please do go see your physician for examination   Ibuprofen or any over the counter painkiller that you can take for a week or so can help if you're experiencing inner ear pain  WOW     You are truly an inspiration    I am avoiding booking any vacations because I didn't know if I could do it  Thank you for giving me hope  Chuck everything  I kept some last time for emergencies and I think that was a major contributor to me starting again   I threw away the last of my cigarettes and my lighters yesterday evening  then got into bed for a sleepless night of insomnia  Still feels better than smoking right now to be honest  I added up what I was spending in a month on bars restaurants  which were mostly alcohol drinks at these places  and I was blown away  That was one of the bigger reasons for my quitting  I don't miss it at all  In the worst of my spiral last year this sub was the only thing that kept me from killing myself   And when some random attacks one of our own we attack back   and that's fun too  Thanks     There's definitely a few who have gotten filed away in that mind folder labeled "this is my job today"   I would never tell a patient that they are nothing more to me than my paycheck  but sometimes it's the only way to get through a shift   It's an important reminder for sure     Thank you   I wish you health and wellness in your recovery  Shrooms are the answer to that Lovely number you've got there  I am of the same age  situation and roughly the number of days sober   I will not drink with you today  wow that's true  thank you It definitely does get easier  Keep yourself steeled and don't be complacent  there will be cravings and it will be difficult  but it does get exponentially easier compared to the first week   I hope you're feeling really proud of yourself  its a fantastic achievement  The 15  comes back from quitting  I think you'll be surprised at how much difference it makes and other things that will come back to you that you didn't realise you were missing    Honestly imo whatever you think you're getting out of smoking weed you can get without it   Oh honey  I'm so sorry    That just freaking sucks   I don't know if they're a jerk  but I wanna call them a jerk   Can I call them a jerk   Jerk   Sending you support here in SD land  If you're in a fair sized town you'll be able to chk out many groups and fellowship halls  Ordinarily fellowship halls have multiple meetings daily  but often no core group and a weak message  Strong groups are where you find people sticking and more emphasis on using the tools we're offered  Plus  after you show up a few times you'll know them and they'll know you   makes opening up easier  Got my ass up after 8 hours of sleep and immediately got to work  Way better start when I force myself up and start doing stuff  Sucks for the first 10 minutes  but then I get in a flow of production  No immodium today or phenibut  Sticking to my four 3g doses  Took one so far  Zero physical symptoms to speak of  And so far I'm in a good mood and not craving more kratom  Gonna be a good day    either tomorrow or Thursday I will take another lope dose around 20mg and maybe a little phenibut  and drop my doses down to 2g each  Stabilise for 2 4 days  rinse and repeat  Seems to be very easy this way  I know some people frown upon using lope and phenibut  but hey  it's working like a charm and I am cautious about addiction  Have a good day my fellow quiters  Fuck  I'll drop it to once a week and if it's still not satisfactory I'll cut it     And a daily smoker for 10 years     that's a lot to give up man  best of luck  Oh and this was just the tip of it   I found the last couple days to be quite entertaining  Thank you Lee  I debated whether it was appropriate to post that or not but I do feel that he would be alright with it as he was a very kind   generous  and loving man   Just take it one second at a time   it does get easier   every moment without smoking is an achievement   Bad time in both our lives  I moved because it was so enabling living next door to her her boyfriend  former junkie   Not drinking today  I love the troll analogy   The best way to defeat that troll is two fold   1  stop feeding it anything   No "under control" videos  they just give it strength to break out and destroy you   2 is going to sound counterintuitive but it's really  really important   That part of you that wants to DESTROY EVERYTHING is valid    in other words  it needs something   It probably needs a hug  a teddy bear  and some reassuring words along the lines of  "you are not broken  you are not defective  you deserve not to feel like shit "  Maybe some ice cream   It's what we ususally mean when we talk about taking care of oneself   We are addicts for a reason  addicting out on our addictive urges  in one way or another  solves a problem for us   Of course it solves it in a destructive way that makes it worse  which is we want to stop  but it's our jobs as recovering people to figure out a better solution   To that end   Don't worry about being gay   First of all  it doesn't matter if you are gay or not  but most importantly  looking at guy's dicks while watching porn is something that 99  of the straight men here can relate to  whether they admit it or not   It doesn't matter at all   It doesn't make you gay that you do those things and also  it doesn't matter a hill of beans if you are  in fact  gay   Give yourself permission to be yourself  stop looking at sexually arousing things of any sort  and you'll start to have a chance to figure out what's really making you tick   And then end point of that is real actual freedom   It's worth it  This just happened to me  Smoked all the time until about 5 weeks ago when I quit out right  Had terrible nightmares for the first 3 4 weeks  but they go away  And please don't replace one drug with another  I know how tempting it will be to just take a benzo for not dream at all  at least I never dream on benzos  I do like it when the mods wipe me clean            Now watch them delete my entire CA post history  he's a pretty good resource is kevin  although to be fair  i believe he went to live in majorca before getting sober  Thank you  I'm looking forward to the CBT  lol I had to retake that one in my old profession it meant a whole different thing   and I really hope it helps  I started off strong with the diet and exercise but now I get maybe 6 9 miles run in a week  My diet is paleo   nothing processed just fruits veggies meats and nuts  and it's worked wonders  My only fear of taking medication is that I had a pretty sizable pill addiction for over a decade  I took pills to feel better and it only made my life spin out of control  I know in my brain medication for anxiety and depression is far different than opiates  My fear is the trigger   but I'm willing to risk it if therapy doesn't meet my needs  Thanks and congrats again    Oh this is SO true   It was harmful for me  and I couldn't live the life I wanted with it defining my days and nights   Perhaps not compared to others  but why would I want to wait until it got so bad that I COULD identify with the horror stories   Great job on that awareness  and I will not drink today with you  The hardest part for me is coming to terms with which of my friends are true friends and which are drinking buddies   I hope some of them prove me wrong    Initially  quitting weed makes me more depressed   My previous motivation to get stuff done and love of life takes a serious nose dive   Then after about a week  the cloud starts to lift and a bit of sunshine peaks through     This is the second time I quit   I am only starting Week 2 but I am feeling more like myself   I know on my first attempt at kicking this addiction  I was feeling pretty awesome by Week 4     no depressive feelings  Thank you all  it's a huge boost of motivation  Seriously  thank you     I'm late checking in  but I will not drink today   I'm feeling a lot better today if that's any consolation  day 4  Not that our bodies or drinking habits are the same  Not drinking today either    I have to disagree  when I smoked I loooved the taste  Maybe not after 10 and 3 coffees in the morning  But if there were spaced out   yum I didn't expect to see this lol  I'm OK  I'm still drinking moderately which I know is a ticking time bomb  but I've used the time to focus on some more pertinent issues and am gearing up to stop drinking again  How are you  Thank you for the kind words  I'm very grateful that I chose to remain sober as that's what he would want most for me   Congratulations on one year  you're a great writer   Currently in the middle of a relapse  2 months of daily smoking after 4 months sober  It's honestly a little sad and surprising how quickly being sober can turn right back into the same old shit  I need to try to quit before the semester starts up next week  but I haven't a clue if I'll be able to  or if I'll even want to  What a shitty fucking boat to be in   Been reading this sub for around a year or so now  and it was one of the reasons I made an account  Had some really nice conversations with people  and I've seen some really awesome acts of kindness    That being said  A lot of times I don't really feel welcome here though  as I'm not currently a full blown CA  Generally just feel lumped in with with people that are "fucking this sub up"  Sure  I drink every damn day  but I don't get up in the morning and drink  I just can't do it anymore  What I drink now combined with the amount of cigs I smoke feels like it's about to kill me    I discovered with the help of Alanon that the alcoholics in my life would take everything I have and then demand more  The hole in their soul created by alcoholism cannot be filled with anything I have  They will keep taking till there is nothing left   As a recovering alcoholic I agree with this statement   You won't change her   She'll continue taking everything from you   Go to Al Anon   get a sponsor asap  Wow    Thank you  That comment really struck a chord with me  I don't know if I would consider myself an alcoholic or and addict but I'm definitely on the spectrum you know   And I can let it slide and get to a bad spot  I let it slide a lot the last few months and I've started to have some real side effects that are pretty much perfectly articulated in your comment   Basically  when my relationship with alcohol starts to interfere with my relationship with others  I need to reign it in and reevaluate  If I don't  I'm making a clear statement with my actions that my relationship with alcohol is more important than my relationship with the people I love  I don't want to make that statement  I don't want that to be the choices I'm making    I'm going to be sober for January  Reset  Get back to basics    Thanks  Which is the cause and which is the effect with regards to my problems and alcohol is something I still haven't figured out   Either way  I've decided it isn't healthy   Alcohol is a horrible coping mechanism so for me  I need to stop no matter what   If it is just a side effect  that'll be easy to figure out and to go from there to fix what's wrong  Not who you asked  but straight up  I asked my mom to come with me  I'm super introverted and anxious and I knew I wouldn't be able to gather up the balls to walk in by myself  So she came with me to my first few  until I was comfortable        So if you've got someone you trust who will go with you  I suggest that  No one cares or has a problem with it  everyone will be happy to have you  and proud of you for finding a way to get yourself to go   Be warned the first 3 4 days are the absolute worst  Expect cravings to start peaking again after a week or two  this is what I noticed  but they will become more and more manageable with time  Nice to see the number going back up after the reset  I'm not drinking today  Pray for her every day for two weeks   Pray from the exact same things for her that you'd pray for for yourself   This is from pg552 of the Big Book  This was me when I was quitting  I simply swapped out weed cravings for a trip to 7 11  and I'd just get whatever sounded good instead   I drank a 6 pack of Clausthaler on NYE  Not spectacular but I thought it was ok  I'm right there with you  on day 6  So far  so good   keep it up     As an AA myself I sure wish he was coming to meetings I go to   He sounds exactly like us   I bet he'd become a great friend  Thank you everyone for being here to check in with  I'm not drinking with you today  For me it's when I can't fall asleep  That's why it's so crucial for me to develop a stable sleeping habit  1   Stop drinking   Insomnia will resolve itself within a month   If not  talk to your PCM Meh   I'm a rare morning drinker now but it does happen  or all night and day which is what happened this weekend    And I can no longer drink every day  but I feel supported in that too   even here   Hey I'm two days sober today   Yay me   And even though I barely commented for a couple months or even came here I still felt the love when I returned  An in between may be that you only interact with her when she's sober   That's your condition to her   And stick to it  I remember the day I quit  I had about 6 smokes left in my pack  I woke up that morning and I just couldn't do it anymore so I picked up those smokes and ripped them up and threw them in the trash  You need to throw them out now and never look back  I'm at day 16 and I will never smoke another day in my life  You can do this       I relate soooo much  I probably drank less than everyone on here  but I realized that it was still a problem for ME  and my mental state  Thanks for writing this  I treat myself with a massage or dinner out at a favorite restaurant   Yeah I disagree with this too  I loved the taste and the feel of it  Doing it with my friends  Enjoying the cold mornings  Having an excuse  as lame and horrible as it was  to go outside several times a day and to force myself to just sit and be still for a bit    Yeah  smoking is bad and I'm glad as fuck that I quit  And ya I can still enjoy going outside  etc  But I think it's dishonest to say the only enjoyment is the addiction  If it wasn't addicting and harmful  I'd smoke my whole life   Scottish guy  28 here  I know what you're dealing with  haha  Everyone and anyone is a drinker  Drinking to celebrate  to drown sorrows  every special occasion  every weekend  bla bla bla  I've been trying to distance myself from that for a while now  I managed 5 months sober last year and was the most productive and freshest I've felt  the rest was weekend heavy drinking as it always is with the Celtic  I realise that that lifestyle is not for me  I have no intention of picking up a bottle this year  It's good you have recognised this at your age   Thats a very interesting way of looking at it  and also kind of sad  I want him all over me again       What do you do when the fight has left you   Refer back to a self intervention letter I wrote to myself in case of relapse  Tap into my network of sober friends in recovery  people who "get it"  Call my sponsor  Promise myself I'll drink tomorrow  the craving usually passes in an hour or so    I also found it helpful to write a detailed history of my relationship with alcohol  Its like a toxic relationship  our brains are wired to remind us of the good times and forget the horrible places it took us   Honestly  right now I'm scared that I think about sex to much but I have a feeling when I'm an old man  I will wish that I had the sexual energy that I seem to have now   "Old Man" of 45 years old here and I can honestly say  a slightly diminshed libido is the only good thing to come out of my 40's   I can still give it to my wife as often as I want but I don't usually feel like I need to fuck everything that moves anymore   Enjoy it while you have it as best as you can  but know that you'll eventually calm down  Yes  It may not seem like it at first because your body gets used to being high  but since quitting I feel much better overall  Smoking started to really make me anxious and regretful  and being sober feels much better   This is Day 4 for me  Waiting for my sleep schedule to normalize  I hate having insomnia through the night     Same as you  Been drinking secretly  Morning  day  night  I had a lot of time off over the holidays and went through a decent bit  hid it from everyone so I wasn't completely hammered   I had a year up until then  Congratulations on the star  good going  Day 19   I too started drinking every night after quitting   2 3 beers turned into 5 6   Finally when my physical symptoms of withdrawal started to go away they were replaced with a hangover   Not worth it at all   I developed a sore throat over the weekend and that forced me to stop drinking last night   I feel great this morning and had my best night of sleep in a while    An interesting thought  the abbey thing   I guess I would equate it to visiting the Scottish Highlands and passing on the single malt   I think I'll just pass on either trip   Oh well  they are places I wont see   But the places I do see will be through sober eyes   With the continued help of this site  my therapist  and the Fellowship    If you have a sponsor and are working the program of AA  I'm not sure why your anxiety would be so high  Meetings are fun  social places  but if you want freedom   the program's where you'll find it   The AA Promises 1  If we are painstaking about this phase of our development  we will be amazed before we are half way through  2  We are going to know a new freedom and a new happiness  3  We will not regret the past nor wish to shut the door on it  4  We will comprehend the word serenity and we will know peace  5  No matter how far down the scale we have gone  we will see how our experience can benefit others  6  That feeling of uselessness and self pity will disappear  7  We will lose interest in selfish things and gain interest in our fellows  8  Self seeking will slip away  9  Our whole attitude and outlook upon life will change  10  Fear of people and of economic insecurity will leave us  11  We will intuitively know how to handle situations which used to baffle us  12  We will suddenly realize that God is doing for us what we could not do for ourselves  Sadly if he was super horny earlier it was probably due to porn or porn thoughts   Here's to substituting alcohol with green tea     One day at a time  Congrats  It has helped me to try something new  I celebrate by doing things I wouldn't have if I were still drinking  Could be as simple as trying a new tea or juice  trying a different meal  etc    I will not drink today  Great job Billy     I'm right there with you  We got this    Best of luck to you  As a new sober friend said to me on this forum  that means you've only had one slip in 7 days  and that's not too bad now  is it  Good job coming back  Cheers to not drinking today  Kroger brand is cheaper and so much bubblier    It's usually  2 99 a twelve pack  but often goes on sale for  1 99   My local Kroger has a horrible time keeping it in stock   My fav is the lemon   Least fav is blackberry cucumber  That is very interesting  he doesnt think he has an addiction  but when I pointed some things out to him  he can have sex for three hours  without coming  more often than not we had to have sex for an hour to get him close  he would lose his erection during these times and have to masturbate to get himself hard again despite me being incredibly tight  etc  since he stopped using porn how ever  I have noticed that he can come much quicker  his erections last longer  and he doesnt seem to death grip his dick as much any more    I dont want him to have to be excluded from his friends  but I know it doesnt make things easier when they have a group chat for example  and share photos of hot girls  he says he doesnt partake in that any more because he is with me now   but it can make a girl wonder lol      Because I decided to train for a Half Math to run parallel with my sobriety  I tend to enjoy a 'cheat day' and eat whatever I want for dinner   Drinking Sunday did me no good whatsoever  I'm going to look at the next 24 hours as my goal Your insight is very appreciated  and definitely well spoken   Thank you   I have to admit I take offense to the implication that I do a "half assed" job with pain control  so let me add some information as far as what nurses in hospital settings can and can't control for the purposes of anyone else reading     I can't speak to suboxone specifically   I haven't had anyone only opioid addicted come in yet  since I've been working for three months   I have had people already on a suboxone dose  and obviously am happy to administer it   I have had many polysubstance abusers    We don't start anyone on a methadone regimen   The only way we do those medications is when they are already part of a treatment program   We have psych social services  and chemical dependency consult in all cases and help people get into a program if they want to take that road   As far as other opiates  I advocate for my patients who are in pain as far as the dosage is concerned   We administer PRN Ativan based on a CIWA scale   The score determines the dose and how often it is given   Anything other than that comes from doctors  and even those orders often come through protocols that the hospital has in place   Especially for alcoholics  they literally can't deviate from what the policies are   If someone is on a prescription opioid  their dose doesn't change when they are in the hospital     Again  your insight is excellent and I appreciate you taking the time to respond   I wish you health happiness and the best of luck in your recovery   I got the Soda Stream for Christmas  No more bottles to return  I've been adding the flavored drops too  I like the lemon and berry  My husband and daughter and I always keep a bottle of carbonated water going  Checking in  3 days in to January  6 days total  As motivated as ever  I'm gonna do this and take back control of my life  You are so Rocking this   Good on You    You will be meeting new people at college and making new friends who don't smoke and you won't be lonely anymore   I love Your optimism  You got this  Your sleep will get better  Some people say it happens after a week or two   I feel like I'm only now starting to get into deep sleep  40  days later  It's unbelievable how much alcohol disrupts your body  even after its effects seems to wear off     Congratulations on your sobriety  I won't drink with you today   P S  Chamomile tea  or sleepy time tea  was a godsend for me for sleep  You have to make the best decision for yourself  My story is not nessecarily his  but it is common  I am now sober for five years  but wife left me in my mid twenties because my drinking was out of control  My drinking continued through several other ruined relationships until I finally stopped drinking for me alone and saved my current marriage  At nearly fifty  and I beat the odds  Only about 10  of alcoholics stay sober for an extended period  Take good care of yourself    Well  his deal is that a dear friend accidentally killed herself whilst drunk  and he carries the guilt of "I should've taken better care of her   "  Ergo  with a timebomb such as meeeee on his hands  well  better break for the hills so it's not his fault again  right  Heh  jury still out on jerk status  but I don't mind you calling him that at all      Thank you x   Thank You  D  yup Still wont be drinking today   Probably my second time in a year making it to a week and i'm not going to mess it up this time  Congrats on taking this step  Remember that God loves you unconditionally  You have eternal life through him  He is always there for you  Your 180 on this sin will for sure though bring you closer to him  To me you are not risking anything  but gaining much as you turn from porn  Keep up the good fight   I never meant to imply that you or other nurses did a half assed job on purpose  I know you are limited by facility protocols and often those are inflexible unless a doctor intervenes personally  It's hard being an addict  Thankfully I have recovered but it took time  I was same as you  I knew I had a problem  but to admit that my life was unmanageable was tough  I considered myself a highly functional alcoholic  Healthy family  good job  never missed a day of work due to drinking  etc  However when I got really honest with myself I realized it was barely manageable  Then I realized I couldn't manage it forever on the path I was on  Was I able to give myself 100  to my family  No  Was I able to give 100  to my employer  No  The list goes on  Yes I was there but not as much as I am there today without drinking  Drinking makes me selfish and isolate  The only thing at the end of the day that is important is that drink  So I had to define my own idea of what manageable is  I know at first when I think unmanageable I go to the hobo on the street that can't function without it  My low was higher than that but I'm in no way better  That could be me if I continued down that path  Thanks for sharing cause I've been there too  I can really relate  I think I'm not alone in also thinking that I could moderately just to be proven absolutely wrong  I just had to accept that my brain works differently  That's the hardest step to take in my opinion so I'm glad to see you've already acknowledged that  Good luck in your journey and I will not drink with you today   When I was sad  angry and drunk and removed alcohol from the equation I was left with sad and angry  It took me a while to figure out what I was sad angry about and learn who I was without alcohol  At that point I was able to learn how to enjoy life again   Best of luck to you  I love this   Thank you   Now I want to have more mini adventures  to celebrate my life a bit more  in all of its iterations  Man fuck that guy  Your struggle with psychological cravings are real and hard to resist obviously and I know that feel  Dude's just a dick  probably gets his ego from the crack he just smoked   Sounds like you gots a cold brother  After a week ish  all physical symptoms should be mostly gone and only mental remaining  Get some rest  lots of fluids  green tea  veggies  soup  and relax  I caught a cold too when I quit ct  Kinda sucks since you just went through wd sickness  Double whammy  Treat yourself well and rest  That was the story of my 2016  I wrote about "slips" and "relapses" the other day and the perspective my father shared    I encourage you to check it out but in a nutshell  my father simply explained that you have to forgive yourself for slipping relapsing b c it takes time to quit something you've used for everything for a decade      Keep your head up and keep going  You got this  We all do      Link    https   www reddit com r stopdrinking comments 5limaw my fathers perfect perspective  I understand I've posted about this in the past  Most of my nightmares take place in my apartment so it makes them even that much more unbearable  A lot of paranormal stuff  dreams that I'm being murdered  just everything I don't want to think about  I absolutely dread going to fucking bed at night  But it's just your mind starting to get a healthy nights sleep  and is working out your real world issues in messed up ways  What's helped me is not eating before bed  like four hours prior  and I take melatonin now  But it sucks  it's just another miserable side effect to quitting  I will not drink today  Have tall glass of ice cold water  E cigs vaping also works but it's a double edged sword  it can lead to smoking as much as it can stop it    Drinking a cold glass of water as if i were 'smoking' it was more than enough to scratch that itch and it healthy  Don't replace one unhealthy addiction with another  It's pretty easy to replace smoking with junk food as your sense of smell returns  this is where the "I quit smoking and gained 10000lbs  don't do it " myth comes from   Thank You  and a great day for you to   gonna say no to the "shift drink" i get at the restaurant  because its never enough anyway  heres to day two of consciousness  i will not drink with all of you today  happy to have a new month  I made it 100 days on my previous streak  but slipped up late december  Happy new years everyone Whether councidental or not  I developed hyperthyroidism during my two years of use  Carrot sticks  mints  chewing gum and lots of water  or unsweetened beverages   Also just switching your attention to other stuff helps  You should have more time now that you are not wasting it outside smoking  so just use it to create something   I've logged 156 days before  CAN I BEAT THAT RECORD  Well  I can contribute to it today     spoiler  I'm going to beat that record  I'm glad I didn't post my original reply then lol   I'm actually glad you posted it though because I realized once you did that there is no way for people to know how it even works   It's definitely hard being an addict   I wouldn't wish those detoxes on my worst enemy  Not drinking today  Day 5 for me    I am doing the same thing  every Tuesday I treat myself to a massage or something similar   Pretty awesome  You can do this if you want it  You'll not change unless you're ready  Sounds like you're ready  I wish you the best of luck   I'm not going to drink with you today     AA meetings should not be confused with the AA Program  Yes  in order to follow the PROGRAM as it's outlined  one does make amends to whomever they wish  If you do not understand this process  you may want to read AA's PRIMARY TEXT   The Big Book  http   www aa org pages en US alcoholics anonymous   Start at page iiii  There you will learn how the PROGRAM works  AA meetings can be compared to a "therapy group"  Anyone can show up and each group has it's own rules and guidelines roughly outlined through  GSO  http   www aa org pages en US aa guidelines   Not all meetings stick to the rules either  So if you don't like someone  attend your group's  usually monthly  service meeting and voice your opinion   Education  http   www aa org assets en US p 16 theaagroup pdf  about AA is important  Today will be day 50  I will not drink today  Same here  That's amazing  I've got a couple more weeks to go to hit the 1 year milestone and I'm so excited    Seeing all these 365ers makes me so happy to not be alone in this wonderful journey    You rock   Don't get me wrong  I love morning drinks  but it just fucks my whole day  Every now and again I'll go as early as noon  but that fucks with my night drinking the next day    Congrats on two days  I'm hoping to get back to being able to go two or three days without drinking sometime in the near future  At least that's what I tell my self every morning when I get up   I think he may have been using the Socratic method on you  The first step of the program of recovery in AA is surrendering to the fact that you are powerless over alcohol  There is a story in the Big Book that resonated with me when I struggled with what the "core issue" was  Its called  Because I'm an Alcoholic    For me  I drank when I was sad and when I was happy  I drank in good times and bad times  I drank when I was sick and when I was well  I drank when I was rich and when I was poor  I drank at weddings and funerals  I drank to forget the past and to relive glory days  I drank in the sun and in the rain  I just drank   because I'm an alcoholic   Excellent post  Keep it up  Please keep posting   Keep coming back and tell us how You are doing   This is going to be tough but You can do it   You are on Day 3 and the withdrawals will be hitting hard   I know   I am not far past Day 3 myself  I can still only eat soups but I can eat   Hot showers and baths will help you feel better   Some take Nyquil to help with sleep    I use Valerian Root at night to sleep and L Theanine through the day to take the edge off   Anxiety goes through the roof when I quit so I take long walks and lift some weights  Good Luck   There's a thing called In The Rooms  They have a website and an app  I don't really use it  so I can't tell you anything about it  I just remember having to sign up for it a year ago in rehab  I lost that sponsor 3 years ago today  He has since passed away  On his death bed I told him that he never gave up on me  I wish he could see me now  Words he said to me years ago have reasonated with me now more than ever  He'd always say  "You have the tools in your head  but they have to make their way to your heart " He had 25 years  I learned so much from him  The tools are slowly leaking into my heart  This sub has been so great   I don't have a good answer  unfortunately  I tried to stay away from any coping mechanisms  I dealt with some rather extreme hunger during week 2 and 3 of quitting  At points my desire for food far exceeded that for a cigarette  But I knew binging on food was pointless  I got past that  But I looked at it as a subconscious desire for a coping mechanism  I guess part of quitting is just dealing with the reality of your addiction  It is going to suck and there isn't much that can make it better  Suffer through and you'll be stronger and better for it  Had I caved into the food desires  I would've joined the group of people that put on weight after smoking  There isn't anything wrong with that  but I knew that I ate enough as a smoker  and that eating more wasn't necessary  Yeah I have to constantly talk myself down from drinking   That's where r dryalcoholics comes into play   Gotta have that support system  I like the pomegranate  and plain  You got this  One minute  one hour  one day at a time  Keep it up  Checking in    still feeling pretty much the same   Fatigued  tired  etc   I did go for a walk yesterday   I have noticed small things changing    such as my ability to have a coherent  flowing conversation   Also  libido is coming back which is weird   The weather outside is cold and dark and rainy   Not very motivating at all   Ughhh so sick of this fatigue   Does anyone else have severe fatigue like me   Literally I can barely raise my arms and moving around is fucking exhausting  intherooms com Create an account  It's free  There are meetings all day every day for nearly all 12 step programs  For me  alcohol isn't something I could do incrementally   Eating healthier  saving money  exercising  keeping the house tidier  these are all things that the incremental approach works well for  but after a long time of trying to approach drinking in the same way I found that it just doesn't   Everything would be fine for a while  I'd go out and have my two drinks at a party or my one glass of wine in the evening  but it created this obsessive thinking   I'd be always concerned with how much I'd had  how much was left  how much other people were having and so on   And also I'd inevitably break down after a few days or weeks and get hammered  either because I "deserved it" or because I was just tired of fighting    I think moderation is such a fight  for me  because of the way it impairs judgment   One drink on its own shouldn't be a problem  but it's that first one that tells you that two isn't so bad either   I rarely would have thought that a dozen drinks were a good idea  but after having eleven  twelve actually seems like just the right amount  The other thing is that I have the ability to be absolutist about sobriety in a way that I don't in those other areas of my life   Eating well is a constant battle because you can't just give up food altogether    Same thing with saving money  you're required to make all of these judgments and micro decisions all day long  which just wears at your willpower   With alcohol  I can just give it up and I don't have to deal with that anymore   That absolutism doesn't make it harder  it makes it so much easier  I'm not being overly critical  By calling it a silly question I'm getting the point across Oh man  If it makes you feel better  the day will come when they are old enough to clean up after themselves  And sometimes they even will  Dude quitting is the hardest part at first  I stopped smoking weed after doing it daily for about 6 months 9 days ago  The first few days are the hardest but once you get around to that day 5 6 mark you'll get your appetite back and start being able to sleep without weed  This feels amazing to me  Being able to live your life independent from weed is a strange feeling but you have to remember you did it for most of your life  so what's different now  Nothing  Just keep living life and day by day you'll stop thinking about it as much  Soon enough the drug will fade from your mind completely  That was also my favorite thing  But my new fave is waking up without those awful feelings of nausea  'how will I get through this day feeling so horrible '  a pounding headache  intestinal distress  guilt  shaky hands  and all those other things each of us neatly calls a 'hangover'  I'm just loving it  Had you held on to them since you quit  I'm glad you figured it out before it became a noticeable problem     I had a DUI several years before I got sober  but that was the only "horrible" thing to happen because of my drinking    Though my drinking probably prevented me from getting things   like a degree  a promotion  etc    I went to outpatient treatment because the therapist I was seeing had me go  even though I knew I wasn't an alcoholic because I didn't drink like my brother       The second night there  a guy from AA came to share his story   When he said that if there was beer in the fridge he couldn't control whether he drank it  that was me   So I realized I was an alky and  ever since  "blame" him for my being one      Count me in   Day 3   I will not drink today   and I am very happy to make that commitment  Thanks for sharing this  I have yet to go boarding again since I've gotten sober but I'm really looking forward to it    Snowboarding was always about having some beers on the lift and throwing them into the bins below  And of course a flask to stay warm    But I was always reckless and felt uncomfortable  No more  I'm glad my head will be in the game from here on out  Hi Talie  Thanks for all of that  Had a great day yesterday  Didn't even consider a drink  Today  i have had my head in books mostly  currently sipping camomile tea and planning on an early night  It seems like we have chosen what is a stressful profession  I'm sure there are ways of channelling that creativly though  Back into the real world tomorrow after the break  All the best and Happy New Year  I remember you from years past  The difference between me relapsing all the time and this streak is not a big one  I just realized it causes me pain  A lot of pain  I internalized that realization and now when faced with thoughts of relapse I am like   "Why would I choose pain "   Yet I still dream of the stuff and that is my biggest struggle now   Trying to O often enough not to dream of the stuff and rarely enough not to get too crazy about sex   Everyone here will tell you to "go to meetings"  That's good advice if you understand how AA works  Read the first 164 pages of the  AA Big Book  http   www aa org pages en US alcoholics anonymous   Start at page iiii  Therein lies the "program of recovery"  Not drinking is only a beginning  Recovery is a lifelong process  You'll see and meet a lot of nice people at AA meetings and you'll also see a lot of not so nice people  AA's are just people  Not all people in meetings mean well either  Read the info about THE PROGRAM if you want to recover  Go to meetings to find other people doing the same  Meeting attendance means very little if you're not actually working the program   Congrats indeed  It is not an easy task to achieve 30 days  Nice  I will not drink  with  you  But I WILL wish you the very best  Holy shit  lol I put in the wrong year for my badge  No I had some smokes left  really didn't want to force myself to finish a pack so I threw it away instead   I like the Kroger kind better  I like blackberry citrus  Thank you for believing in a total stranger  And really it is admirable knowing even though you aren't happy  the solution is not in a drink  I want to get there too  Lattes and cappuccinos are my favorite small rewards  I like clothes shopping for the bigger rewards  Or buying a book for my Kindle  Or taking my kids out for lunch  All things I didn't "have the money for" when that money went to the liquor store instead  Congratulations  I'm 21 and stopped drinking nearly three months ago   Tangerine  tangerine   Living reflection from a dream  That quote was honestly the catalyst for me quitting  Personally  I would prioritize AA meetings over counseling and yoga classes  as it has worked for me now and in the past    At the end of the day  the only requirement to stay sober is not to pick up a drink  Some people can do this without ever attending an AA meeting  Some people need to go to multiple meetings every day for years   I am writing something like diary since 2009  I write the date and the hour I write at that moment  It is really enjoyable to read what I was doing years ago  I recommend writing that even if you are not on pornfree  You've had lots of Non Drinking Victories in the last 12 days  That's awesome   Let me echo what everyone has said so far   you'll be fine  I met a lot of different people in rehab  Heroin addicts   alcoholics  pill heads  smokers  and everything in between  It doesn't matter the substance  we all have the same problems    I felt out of place because I used pharmaceuticals and I was a young professional  I nearly didn't go because my problem "wasn't as bad " I thought the street junkies would judge me  Surprisingly  I could relate to them a lot  We all had our reasons for using and addiction does not discriminate  You'll be in the right place and you'll learn a lot about yourself and others if you're open to it   Presidents Choice Blonde Brew  but I think it may be a Canadian exclusive  Closest to tasting like a beer and much cheaper than all the others  7  for 12   What about trying audio books or podcasts  or calling a friend  Hi  A lot of that rings true  Particularly the indentifying the time of drinking    I'm currently on the look out for a new bicycle to combat this one    Just thinking a long bike ride may be the way to go if nand when those cravings kick in  Yeah I don't think a break will do it for me    I've been on the moderating roller coaster for a while now  learned abstinence needs to be the way for myself  On your last comment  that gave me an idea    Writing and posting letters to ourselves on days the cravings were strong could be a rewarding method of combatting this  Oh  I need to request a badge now    I'm 2 days behind  All the best and good luck   Mid way through my taper right now  Been doing good but it is so so hard  Was hoping it had worked for you  hehe   Although of course moderate drinking is better than the alternative   How much are you drinking nowadays    I like the Polar brand  especially their orange vanilla   For La Croix specifically  I like the Peach Pear  the Berry  and the Passionfruit   I didn't think the Apricot tasted like anything   I like to add some TrueLemon stevia lemonade mix  about 1 3 of the packet per can glass of sparkling water    Personally I LOVED the dreams  Even the scary ones  they were so real  The worst are the ones where you dream you were smoking and wake up thinking you fucked up  You probably have another week or so  just gotta tough it out  Good luck  I also thought I drank because of my pattern of problems and issues  But I'd been getting drunk since my teens  and most of my difficulties had alcohol in the background  if not the forefront   So stop drinking and see how it goes for you  If you can't stop then take antabuse or another pill to restrict your drinking and see how that goes  If you find you don't much like reality sober then find a way change your personality to become an individual able to enjoy life without needing to drink again   You can see that changing what you're doing now is required to begin  Otherwise  you know what you can expect to continue  Congratulations   Congrats on your 100 days    On a side note  if you don't have a plan for your marathon training  check out  The Non Runner's Marathon Trainer  https   www amazon com Non Runners Marathon Trainer David Whitsett dp 1570281823   I signed up for one on a whim after getting out of a long hospital stay and this book was great  It's not for serious runners but it was just what I needed to get me through my first one  Thank you  I really wish I realized it sooner and made the decision earlier  Really happy I'm not the only one who reacts badly to so much alcohol  I frequently feel like  "why is this happening to me when there are so many other people around me who can have a casual drink and never get to this point "   Congrats on your 361 days by the way  I relate so much to what you wrote  thank you for sharing   I'm 100  with you  I hate smoking but I love it at the end of a long day  I've been 'quitting' for 6 months now  but I didn't actually want to quit as much as I wanted to keep smoking  I realized that I have to want to stop for myself and finally say I don't want this habit to be a part of my life anymore  I have to remind myself how disgusted I am that my hands clothes breath stink  and how much I want to be able to taste and smell my food again  Another motivating factor for myself is that I never wanted a substance to control me the way tobacco can  and I hate coming in after a break and knowing my co workers can smell me  silently judging ha  Yeah  but at least heroin gets you high  Can I ask what your symptoms were  Did the symptoms seem to get worse after you took kratom   I will not drink today  Hmm maybe try out stem and vein  At such low doses  you may just be psychologically addicted to the habit of taking something  Perhaps try to replace it with stem and vein or brewind green tea  I know exactly how you feel man  It's a habitual addiction that keeps us stuck  You need to find a hobby or healthy substance to ingest  For me  it's green tea  guitar  meditation  and eventually exercise and focusing on diet  You're almost there buddy It is easier for me if I have a plan in place to follow  Even better if this plan is leading towards a goal  I wont work out very much if every day is  "should I work out today " I should already know that going in  If it is just up in the air  it will be a million times harder  recovering from booze or not   I like to write it down to get the plan going  I wish I had the self control to have just one drink and that's it  If I have one  I know I want another and another until I'm wasted     Thank you  I appreciate that  Where you a heavy user   What was your daily dose amount      About an hour ago  I swear I was momentarily hearing actual voices in my head telling me to go buy another pack  or how I can smoke and just taper down until February  or whatever other argument that these 'voices' presented that I determined was my addiction trying to get the better of me  I've never attempted to quit before  It took everything in me to finish my workout  stay awake  drive home  not buy a pack  not buy a bottle of dokha  not bum a cigarette  not take the detour  not buy a pack of Nicorettes  not eat some garbage to stave off the cravings  and just make it back home in one piece where I know there's nothing to smoke   This is why it is so difficult to quit  Just try to persevere through it all and eventually it won't be difficult  But there is no magic bullet  You must suffer   you might not have seen my older posts  but Im not actually planning on quitting games alltogether  I used to wake up every 1 5 3hrs  drink so I could fall back asleep  and repeat the cycle   Quitting drinking didn't fix it overnight   However  today I sleep better than I remember sleeping since grade school  I'm 34     Here's how I did it  https   www reddit com r stopdrinking comments 5lfp9v recovery from alcoholism ptsd depression anxiety   Im with you   I had insomnia for 14 or 15 years  and sleep hygeine  it's important to not stay in bed when you can't sleep  because it trains your brain to associate being awake while in bed  really helped me out  along with a visualization I learned in a chronic pain class   The visualization keeps all parts of the brain active  so that its impossible to let your mind wander   Here it is  Visualize that you're holding a marker and can really feel it  and you have a whiteboard   Slowly draw a circle   Inside the circle write "1"  then underneath write an emotionally calming word of your choice such as "calm"  "peace"  etc   The visualize wiping the whiteboard clean  and draw anither circle  write 2  calm  wipe clean  then go up consecutively   It may help to time yourself for 2 minutes while awake to see what number you end up having  then multiplying that by 10  so that you know which number you should get out of bed after reaching  as you don't want to stay in bed after 20 mins   Hope this hekps   It sure helped me  Same question  Where you a heavy user   What was your daily dose amount    100  agree with everything you said yes  benefits of stopping smoking   sorry  my mistake   Also  melatonin 10mg does freakin wonders for some ppl  Yeah that is so crazy  It is amazing how how booze can twist rational thought around like that  I guess that is the addictive part  Love this  I've never been an addict  and the negative affects have been pretty small  but still enough for me to want to cut it out of my life  You're right that changing the price of a packet will recalculate all past days according to the new value  We've wanted to accommodate price changes for a while but it's not straightforward  Though as I'm just about to finish my PhD maybe I'll have more time to work out how to do this properly  WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE SIT THE FUCK DOWN AND POUND BOTTOM SHELF BOOZE THROUGH YOUR ASS UNTIL YOU PASS THE FUCK OUT LIKE A NORMAL CA GOD DAMNIT  Exactly  The I tried the Kroger brand because I thought the Lacroix was way over priced  Was not dissappointed   Thank you  Yes I have been trying to fill my days with positive actions thus far   Before I have been a bit of a moper through the sober days and I'm understanding this is completely the wrong attitude  Sleep isn't happening very much over the last couple of nights after the excesses of the holiday period but I know that will get easier  sooner rather than later  I'm looking forward to consistently having clear thoughts while falling to sleep again  Any advice for when the stress of the term starts to creep in  That was a tricky one for myself for the last  aprox  six weeks of last term  Thank you for the post and happy new year  Thank you  dude  I was wondering about the timeline for cannabis detoxing  Thought processes and such   They've been pretty controlled ever since I woke up this morning  I won't drink today  As in 2 3 times weekly  Stay strong my friend  It will get better  Fairly heavy user  Before my first quit attempt  I had been a daily user since late 2011  At my worst I was probably at 18 20 grams a day  This last relapse I got up to 15 18 grams  but I feel like the kratom I was taking was much stronger  and caused really bad side effects   Good on you   I took me until age 46 to realize my problem   Smart to recognize it early   Lots of resources out there to help as well   Good luck  I can definitely understand this feeling  I thought about my situation a little bit last night  and I'm looking at it like this was my path to manhood  I staved off maturing for a few years by using  and now I am practicing self mastery in recovery   I will not drink on my very special smiley day  happy new year  everyone   I will not drink today  Makes sense that yours is in the morning   Testosterone is highest in the morning for men  that's why morning wood is a thing   Have you tried masturbating without porn in the am  Or are you doing nofap as well  This is awesome to hear    I found this subreddit today    Apprehensive to go to any type of group  or one on one counseling but I spend a lot of time on reddit  2 days so far  here's hoping I can make a post like this next year   I think you may be onto something    During my first month or so  I was all over the place  I really did a number on my brain by drinking so much   it took a while for all those nuerotransmitters to rebalance themselves  Hang in there buddy  It is so worth it  Excellent  Keep it up  Congratulations   You're doing great   High fives  Hi  Thank you  Yeah  Life has a way of delivering it's bitch slaps  I must learnt to respond appropriately to these moments  Thank you for the encouragement  Happy New Year  Yep  same    Your post title implied you're doing the 90 day detox so I replied based on that  but what I said still applies  Even looking at gaming content is bound to end in a relapse  You're always looking at it through rose colored glasses thinking about the good times  The best thing to do is just not go near anything gaming related  Best of luck  Opiates and benzos here as well  Thanks for sharing and for the well wishes  I've been putting in work  but could always have room for improvement  For instance  I've been sleeping in a lot lately and I could use that time in the mornings to be productive  I am happy that I no longer need days of rest to recover from long days  I can take a nap and be right back at peak energy  That said  I know more will come   I'm so sorry   Thanks  Awesome  that's very reassuring to hear  along with what the others echoed     I will not drink today   Because our weed dealer demands to be paid in cash rather than hugs    I so relate to how you feel   The only times I've ever felt suicidal   I realize   where when I was drinking    Please let yourself off the hook about slipping     This is a disease   It's not your fault you got it    Shame really kept me from going to AA for quite awhile   but really   they are the only people who understand what I'm going through   I was so afraid they would judge me   and some did I'm sure   but the good ones know the struggle and will do everything they can to help you    When I hear someone come in who's in pain or struggling staying sober   I just hope so hard they they can get this sobriety thing   I don't judge them at all   cuz that was me    What worked for me in the beginning was praying like hell for God to take away my desire to drink   and finally it worked    Once I had a foothold   AA was the support I needed    I'm pulling for you   You can do this   I will not drink today  I love when people tell me what is and is not wrong with me  based on limited information  a ton of biases and without any prompting  You don't know you'll be sober come 2018  I'd say yes great you want to get there  but maybe just think of this day and how you can keep sober today  It is to big a deal to think of 12 months  sometimes I try to make it 12 minutes at a time   Will you ask for help off anyone in person  Be careful of trying to do this alone   Fantastic idea to help you identify triggers   I've heard advice that it's a good idea to think about replacement activities ahead of time before urges  and writing those down too so that you can just quickly refer to a list and be given options without having to think about it  when the urge strikes   Good luck  and great idea  Seriously  I have experienced that a million times over courtesy of my friends   "I don't have a drinking problem"  according to them  and they are far more comfortable making that diagnosis after they've been drinking   They've seen me blacked out  seen me fall over things  had to restrain me from fights or from driving home  seen me be a crass a  hole in public  watched me get physically sick  spend money I don't have  and be drunk in front of my kids   BUT  like you  they told me "I'm not an alcoholic"     I'm pretty sure the only thing that says is that they're nowhere near qualified to make that diagnosis   I never felt a single fucking compulsion to justify quitting to them  and I still don't   If they can't support my decision I don't care to hear their input   I personally think you owe your cousin about the same  but whatever you decide good luck  Once heard something that really hit me   "cigarettes don't relieve the craving they create it" Man I had a dream last night that I was smoking up and I felt the complete guilt of a relapse and thinking this is the way things are going to be  and I woke up in hot and cold sweats it was actually some pretty scary shit  I've definitely been experiencing some thoughts that I've got myself far away  can't I use again and not be back to square one  Luckily though I did that twice last year  both times around the 45 day mark  I'd like to say I've learned my lesson  I'm staying guarded and on my toes and working to reform my mindset  I know I'm in very early recovery  Thanks for sharing  I like to do those activities to get out of my own head as well I'm sorry  I don't know how much that helps  but there it is   Grief is a total asshole  When my foster brother committed suicide I found myself doing  thinking  and saying things that felt totally alien  horrible  like not me  All I can say is that if you feel fucked up  it's totally okay to be fucked up  Not in the "go get plastered" sense  but in the sense that you're just    not okay  You don't have to be okay  You don't have to pretend to be better or worse than you are   That's all I've got  But there you have it  I feel you  oh Large Child  this was amazing  please keep writing   Lmao    Sometimes I come too and don't even realize I ever posted on here  Congratulations   Thankfully I'm not drinking a 5th a day  but I know that one bottle of wine will turn into much more  Fuck my addict brain  I can't believe I am here  I am almost in tears and feel so much anxiety and nervousness as I type this  So many thoughts and don't know how to formulate them    But here is my decision  I am not going to drink today   Enjoy and let me know how the night with the barmaid turns out  Haven't quit yet but I'm looking forward to the return of dreams  I'm planning on trying to learn how to lucid dream  It's happened to me a couple times and the feeling of realizing that you're dreaming is surreal  Maybe that's something you can try if you're dreams are bad  Realizing you're dreaming would help a lot  According to  r LucidDreaming you can train yourself to do it  But I don't remember my dreams often enough to attempt it yet  That's not a huge dose or a super long length of time   GET OUT NOW  I used to only take a couple grams a day and before you know it it's 2 years later and you're taking 25g day just to feel shitty instead of REALLY shitty Who made your cousin the end all be all of defining alcoholics  One thing I realized is  this is my journey  There are lots of helpful people for sure  but I am experiencing this life of my own by myself  I have my own goals and values  which in turn defines when things like alcohol become a problem  Maybe your cousin has issues with his parents drinking and was kind of trying to let you know how bad it was by downplaying you   What helps me  doing a mindful meditation and drinking chamomile tea before bed  it's a natural relaxer or something   I still have vivid dreams but they aren't bad anymore  Also exercising can help wear you out to not dream at night    That sounds awesome   In my head I also include the junk takeout I bought when hungover 'because I deserve it for making it through the day'   Also damages when I drank  like punching out the window to my front door when I was too drunk to get my keys to work  or the rug I threw out because I puked on it  He'll be better minus porn than with it  it's quite the rollercoaster for many when they try this  Is he still masturbating  I thought I'd a high sex drive  now I'm not sure  my porn habit messed with it so much  So I am wondering when I am in a relationship again what will it be like  I've never been in a relationship and not been viewing porn at least once a month  and you'd be surprised how much even a monthly binge affected me  Also if he a full on porn addict  you might find he not stopped  What did he do to stop  If you want to play porn police   K9 has a way you can't delete history from it  and you his SO could view his history   Boy I'm ready for a couple days to go by without thinking about dope haha  And thank you  I've got nothing on your clean time yet  I'm always glad to hear from you though   I'm holding up decently well  Last week was rough but I got through it  and I feel more confident about tackling this week now  My work routine should be switched up fairly soon after my manager gets back and I'm getting sent to a much less busy store so that when I get a real career  also hopefully very soon  then it will be easier for the company to transition with me leaving    When I'm feeling really stuck I've been going to movies by myself lately  A great activity to help distract myself for a few hours and switch up my routine    What do you do  Lmao   Damn darling   Don't worry I'll be there again   Just taking a week or two   Can't afford to get fat   I may need a sugar daddy pretty soon and I've got a couple of guys jockeying for the position  I have a bedtime routine that is always the same   it allows my brain the time to switch from being active to inactive and trains it to expect sleep soon  I'm pretty sure it's not so much about what I am doing but about the consistency and order  It takes about an hour     make sure I am hungry or thirsty  if so  eat protein     pick up the house so it's nice and tidy when I wake up  check on the pig    brush and floss  clean the contact lenses  dry skin brushing  I have a shower earlier in the evening to allow my hair to dry     meanwhile  reflect on the day and how great it was because I didn't drink  resolve not to drink tomorrow  plan my day to avoid or manage potential triggers     have a 15 minute mindfulness session with a warm eye mask  I suffer from blepharitis so I use linseed one that I warm up in the microwave      if I am still not sleepy  drink a small cup of chamomile tea while doing nothing else     go to bed with a boring book  read for 15 mins and try to sleep for half an hour    My bedroom is dark and cold and there is no television there  It is free of clutter and organised   Any intrusive thoughts are not entertained  I simply acknowledge the bad thought and decide that now is not the time to think about it and then take my thoughts to my safe place  I am not always successful but it's getting better so it seems it's a matter of practice   It took a while for my sleeping patterns to even out after quitting drinking and I still sleep too much  over 10hrs unless I set the alarm   At the beginning  I just had to bear with it  Drinking wouldn't have solved this problem   it would simply prolong it and create other problems  I accepted I was undergoing a major change so it figured I would have to be uncomfortable for a while  At the beginning  my goal was not sleeping but simply completing the routine and getting to bed    I also have new fluffy pillows  a v pillow  body pillow  leg pillow and a small pillow  and they help me get comfortable and feel supported  It all cost like 50 and was worth every penny  That's exactly where I was  especially the constraining freedom but all of it is true  Didn't even realize it but today was my 3 star so yay for 90 days  It gets better  I still have cravings but it definitely gets better  You're not fucking up the sub  I get annoyed when people ask things like do I belong here am I a CA  because the second I saw this place I was like oh my fuck I am a CA I belong here  The rest is history    I remember when some of the current top posters started posting here  There was no introduction  It was basically drunken story telling and it was fucking awesome then as it is now  They weren't instantly welcomed or instantly rejected    they just posted here and are now top posters  I dunno  It doesn't seem hard to me to not be shat on here but so many people come in demanding that I shit on them  Welcome  It can be a scary leap  No one wants to label themselves an "alcoholic"  It's a dirty word  Getting rid of an obvious problem in your life   that sounds pretty good   Your entire 2nd paragraph is something I was trying to articulate  and you've done it marvelously  It's that obsession that takes hold  not every day  but when it does it certainly doesn't feel good  Once you've stopped and look back  it becomes so obvious it was there and quite a burden  I can assure you that even at 2 months sober  that obsession is completely gone and it feels amazing  I'm sure it hits at different times for different people    Could I moderate myself and drink only 1 or 2  Yes I can  But that obsession would always be there  and I don't like it  By choosing not to drink at all  the obsession is gone and I feel free  It's a wonderful feeling  and I know you will soon feel it too  Sounds good  might be hard to get counter to do and confuse newbies  But I get your points  but I suppose we do this for us  we know if we'd a week long binge  we know a week long binge is worse for us that a 1 hour look   Ha  Obviously it looked like you had quit over a year ago  I have a pack and a half that I decided to keep   I've stopped before and I think I've learned that for me it's better to just to know they're there  whereas in the past I think I felt a bit anxious about not having any and ended up buying some and then of course smoking them   But everyone's psychology is different  Best of luck  No thanks  I keep my own diary with it written in too   I'm not drinking with you too   You are all crazy   Coconut is the BEST flavor    Glad to see the coconut hate in this thread though   more for me     I will not drink today  Hey first of all   your situation sucks and it appears like you are handling it as calmly and positively as possible so I applaud you for that    Second of all  an alcoholic will never get better until they hit "rock bottom" or find their own breaking point  For some people  it's a rather shallow bottom  for others  they never even hit it  Sadly  from my experience with my own alcoholic father  who currently lives on someone's couch and has had no driver's license or job in years   they will find a way to either A  crawl back up from bottom or B  continue their bad behavior    My advice is do what you think is best for her  and to ease your conscience  and let her be responsible for her own actions  Insomnia has always been a huge issue for me since I was a kid   I try to dim the lights at least 30 minutes before bed and stop playing any games on my phone   I take Benadryl and Valerian Root before bed  sometimes also TrueCalm magnesium lemonade   I am about to start phasing out the Benadryl as I have been falling asleep easier   Others here say Melatonin and sleepy teas work for them but not really so much for me   Have you been reading in bed   I started reading on a device in bed with the lights off for about 15 20 minutes and that has been really helpful   I also use a sleep eye mask sometimes    I mean if his friends go on about porn and "chicks" all day  then they are weird anyway  If they don't  then maybe he should just quit that group chat  Even if they don't post actual porn in there  it might trigger him into a relapse   And I mean the fact that your sex life together got that much better after he quit porn is kind of an indicator for it being an addiction   Also don't compare yourself to women from porn or stuff like that  If he's anything like me with that stuff he doesn't see those women as real women  it's just something to feed his addiction  How often is check in required  Congratulations on getting back up  and welcome back   No one here should ever be ashamed of slipping  they should be proud they're strong enough to keep trying  Not drinking today with you  Yeah I was in the whole start it finish it mindset  It's lead to me force smoking just so I can finish a pack   I check in every morning and type 'I will not drink today'  I found it calmed the 'looking forward to a beer later' type thoughts as I had made a promise to not drink that day  I still make the statement each day but more in affirmation than anything now as the desire to drink has gone   I wish you well and will not drink with you today  You're really smart to realize this at 22  I am 25 and probably should have stopped when I was your age  I can tell you that although I have had some fun with alcohol since 22  all of my regrets come from times when I have been drinking  All of my fun could have still happened  just sober  Then I would remember it better too   Good luck with this journey  I'm right here at the beginning of it with you   We dont live together  there is no way for me to actively check  I am just relying on his word  I am not too sure how often he has been masturbating  I want to assume less though  I have asked in the past just out of curiosity when were talking about our day  and more and more he would say he didnt even masturbate  Its like he thinks that he cant masturbate if he cant watch  so I dont know what to do to help    I sent him photos and stuff of myself  but do you think that might be detrimental to his progress   The part about being present with others is so confusing at first  A lot of people  myself included  thought that alcohol loosened them up and helped them to bond socially with other people  It didn't make any sense to my old self that being sober made my interactions any more meaningful   in fact  the opposite seemed true   I see now what people are talking about  There's a huge difference between being fully and consciously engaged with people  and just being uninhibited  I realize now that a lot of those late night "deep" conversations slurring words to each other were actually quite shallow and burdensome  Hi  thanks  I haven't ever been to any sort of rehab or even an addiction support group meeting  I basically ended up manipulating every psychiatrist I've ever seen to get my drug of choice  and found them to be pretty unhelpful when I did try to confess ask for help with my substance abuse issues  I haven't had any headaches until the 40th day mark I think  It felt like my brain was split in half at times  I had them for a few nights  but it passed  Try  ibu profen  It helped me  IF you were a heroin addict would you wean yourself off it  Actually some do with state help  I'd say cold turkey with help  12 step addiction group  therapy  anxiety groups etc  mainly mate I'd say  try not to do this alone  Take help from others  ask for help from others try see you deserve help from others  That made a big difference  Help might be just asking a mate to go for a walk cause you feel a bit lonely  Maybe a group self help about anxiety might be good for you  What if she was shit in bed  We always think it is the mans job to give out orgasms  It's both peoples role to make sex good for each other  LAdies love oral sex as much as men  they love massages  they love being touched and kissed  they aren't all about putting penis in them  Maybe do that too  might be less pressure on your dick alone to do magical things   I define success by living a life that lines up with my values  which in turn allows me to meet my set goals  This basically means discipline  I think success is on the path toward improvement  Similar to finances   am I getting more and more into debt  drinking unhealthy habits  or getting out of debt into positive net worth  good habits   Ahhhh  the sweats are so wicked    When in the thick of withdrawal and experiencing the no sleep and hot cold sweats     I sleep on a huge bath towel and have a couple of dry towels stacked by the bed to change it during the night   I sleep in a tshirt so I strip off the tshirt and put on a dry one and change the sweat soaked towel for a dry one and climb back in   It helped with my comfort and ability to fall back asleep  One day at a time works and so does One minute at a Time   Good Luck and Hang Tough   Day 2 is no cakewalk but I don't suppose You are expecting it to be  We can do this   We are doing this   When the Going gets Tough   The Tough get Going   Polar orange vanilla is amazing  I have thought this exact statement  "Am I really an alcoholic " In the end  I think it is the alcoholic side finding an excuse to keep me from stopping          I drank a lot by myself daily  but I always had money to pay my bills  I have never hurt anyone or myself when I drink  but I am more LIKELY to argue with people  I am still responsible with my duties by going to work or getting stuff done  even when I'm hungover  but I won't be nearly as focused        So  am I really an alcoholic         To me  Yeah  I am  Why  Because although I still am able to complete my responsibilites  I was starting to realize that I am RELYING on alcohol to feel better or reward myself  I'd find any excuse to drink          Had a bad day at work  Drink     Had an awesome day at work  Drink      Feeling stressed from personal issues  Drink     Worked out for a week straight  Drink          To me  thats the first step to letting the alcohol start to slowly consume my ability to stay responsible  I get anxious when I feel the urge to drink  but haven't  Next thing I know  I'm going to be like  "Another handle of tequila won't hurt me financially  I made it fine last month " Then one leads to two  and so on  I can sense how my urge to drink will start building up if I don't stop now  If I didn't have that 'urge to drink' like I do  then I don't think I'd be an alcoholic  But that feeling urge is there  and I don't want that taking control of everything I have worked so hard to have         Sorry  this post was about me  but to answer your question  yeah    I think this is something maybe a lot of other people go through too  Best stay away from anyone porn related that turns you on  it'll only give you ques to want porn   I'm not sure I fully agree with that    When I think back on my 23  years of smoking  there were absolutely times when I particularly enjoyed the sensation of smoking  for example after a big meal or after sex  You can say that was just the addiction tricking me into believing I enjoyed it  but I don't think that's the case  People have smoked addictive and non addictive substances for thousands of years   there must be something to it    I agree that it's helpful to think of smoking as an endless cycle of needing to smoke because we smoked  I just think that's 99  correct  not a complete true ism    900 could pay for a nice trip for you    You've made it 4 days  you can make it today  Sounds like one hell of a plan  I won't drink with you today   Free time for me was a killer   It honestly took me scheduling out my free time to get over it  Thanks for the reply  My goal is to be porn free for the rest of my life  I also know that this is a daily battle  That is why I included what I would do daily to change my habits  I do have 2 irl friends that I can talk to as well   It says 60 reasons not 50    another reason to quit lol The urge to drink is incredibly powerful    Craig Ferguson has the following quote which I feel is currently applicable in order to make sense of your urge  Alcohol ruined me financially and morally  broke my heart and the hearts of too many others  Even though it did this to me and it almost killed me and I haven't touched a drop of it in seventeen years  sometimes I wonder if I could get away with drinking some now  I totally subscribe to the notion that alcoholism is a mental illness because thinking like that is clearly insane   Congrats  good luck and hang on  The R SD is always here    Will do  Glad to know someone else here has been through the same  I noticed hot showers help as well  Only because I haven't seen it posted here yet  LaCroix Grapefruit is my go to   Hey thank you  My now ex said the same thing to me  I have to deal with this problem on my own and she didn't want to be along for the ride anymore  I can't blame her   You've made it 208 days and you're still on here spreading encouragement which makes me feel really good  So thank you again  And congrats of course  This is why I switched to boxed wine  Then I had about two armloads worth of one specific kind of flattened box to get rid of  and was living in a country where you had to leave cardboard outside  tied up with just a string and nothing else  The shame was palpable  I agree   There needs to be more conversation about how alcohol doesn't add anything to your life  so even if it's not destroying it  Yet   Just wait   you can still benefit tremendously from quitting    One of my favorite all time SD posts was  paraphrasing here   "Life Pro Tip   Do this one thing to lose weight  save hundreds of thousands of dollars  improve health   increase energy  boost sleep  improve sexual stamina  be a better human  father  mom  sister  colleague  etc    I think everyone here knows that this wonder product is simply abstinence  Congratulations   I was amazed at how every aspect of my life improved when I gave up alcohol   I hope you reap the same rewards  Sign me up  I really  REALLY  needed this  Thank you   Man  I didn't even think about the incidentals  I would snack quite a bit when drinking  I mean  how was I expected to drink that entire bottle    of wine without some quality NY sharp cheddar  pepperoni  and crackers      You're absolutely right  Every single time I drink  I run the risk of blacking out  My counselor told me every single time I pass 3 drinks  i'm just playing with fire  At this point  even one drink is playing with fire   I'm definitely looking forward to the benefits of not worrying about drinking  Glad it will get easier eventually  Congrats on your journey Definitely needed to read this  Thank you  I'm so sorry    My best friend from school drank himself to death about six years ago  and I drank a lot to deal with it  It didn't help  Another friend committed suicide about five years ago  and it was the fifth anniversary of his death a few days ago that led me to the final bender that will mark the end of my life as a drinker    It's okay to feel as bad as you need to  but please don't drink to deal with it  It won't make you any better and will just extend your grief  Again  my deepest condolences   I am starting out the year with a similar injury  I broke my ankle and just had surgery  screws and plates  to repair it last week    I'm grateful I've been sober through this and I also view it as a way to stay sober      You're not alone going through this    Good luck    You got this  Hardest part for me was learning to say no  wife works a side gig as a bar tender   But one I did  and my wife started standing for me it became the easiest thing in the world   I'm 44 as well and I'm committed to sobriety  I may slip  I have a couple of times already  but I know I'm making progress  Today I will not drink with you   Have her give you BJs  This scares me  I've been lurking in this sub for a while and am quitting shortly when I run out   7 days a week around 8 times a day and I'm quitting cold turkey     I'm kinda scared  So true     I was taking up to 28 grams per day  The thing is  alot of the symptoms of hyperthyroidism are nearly identical to that of kratom abuse  hair loss  anxiety  weight loss  blurry vision  dry skin   the list goes on  Luckily  I was diagnosed with subclinical hyperthyroidism  and not Grave's Disease  My condition is reversible as long as proper diet and exercise are implemented  We will never get better if we don't stop taking kratom  I am 16 days kratom free and already notice improvements in some of the symptoms listed above  Kratom fucks with horomones pretty hard and that includes the thyroid  First off  best of luck with your surgery  I hope all goes well   Second  congrats on making it three weeks those couple of times   Seriously  don't get down on yourself just because you can't make three months  instead focus on your success in making it as long as you did   This is only my second time at a week after over a year of trying  so don't give up   You'll see it said a lot around here  just take it one day at a time  three months can seem scary  I know it does for me  but the next day  The next hour   I can handle those goals and I bet you can too    whatever you think you're getting out of smoking weed you can get without it   This is so true it hurts  I'm actually getting more without it because I have the mental capacity and the time to take care of myself properly  I wouldn't call myself "awful" for relapsing  I relapsed  twice  very hard  The realization that I didn't necessarily choose relapse  that it was something inevitable given the fact that I wasn't treating my alcoholism  relieved a lot of my guilt  Anyway I was going to also say that I have felt similarly   I am grateful that I am able to live free of alcohol and not have it play a role in my life anymore  Had I fallen to my bottom so quickly in life  it may have slowly deteriorated my health and mental well being for years  I get to live a full life now that it snuffed itself out  No more fuel to add to the fire  Congrats on your 9 days  You don't know you have an abnormal sex drive  it's not like alcoholics like the taste of booze more than most or are more thirsty  I'd say  give up porn for 90 days and limit masturbation  see what sex drive you have then  Most people on here use porn like others use pills or booze  I'm sad  porn  I'm anxious  porn  I'm afraid  porn  I never learnt to cope with life  I used to masturbate for 1 to 14 hours daily everyday  now I never masturbate  have no sex last few months  I'm still alive  I'd like sex yep  like a partner to share life and sex life with yep  Many porn addicts will turn down partners to stay up and look at porn  it was my escape from life so I'd not want to be intimate with partner    Just for today  I pledge not to drink   Wow  congratulations      Not drinking today Keep it up  Exercising can help "withdrawal" struggles  Dude I've been having the craaaaaziest dreams  We should have a thread just for posting our weird dream synopses   YES       I love this post     Thank You     You Rock   I realized that smoking for me mimics the breathing exercises of mindfulness and meditation   Yup it is amazing too see how much you spend on alcohol     Rock on day 3  You can do this I cannot thank you enough for sharing your story  I'm glad you have found the self forgiveness and tools required to move on in life   Damn I can't name the last time I went a day without a beer and I always use the excuse bc I worked all day but after finding this sub today  I'm gonna try to go today without drinking  Back to work today after a two week break  Whole office is closed so everyone was on that return to work vibe  On the whole I'm happy to be back  A solid routine has been critical in my recovery and time off work slowly eats into it  Get up slightly later  train later  meal timings etc  And it adds up over two weeks  So as much I'm grateful to have had the time off and to spend a lot of it with my boy I'm ready for the return to normality    Sciatica was easier today  Just pins and needles and usual mobility limitations  No real pain   I'm moving into my own rented place on the 20th     That got confirmed today  I've just been renting a room since I got clean  Which has definitely been a solid choice  Its let me save enough for a 10  deposit on a house  And it's provided accountability to someone  But I'm ready to have my own space again  I was hoping to buy with the money I have saved up but mortage providers want 15  due to adverse credit from the fallout caused by divorce and selling my old home  So a years rent and then hopefully buy again early 2018  For me a great tool I have learnt in my recovery is to genuinely embrace the positive in any situation  Ok  so I was disappointed when mortage applications got rejected but renting is a great low pressure first step  Get me used to managing a home again before jumping in with a mortage    Yes  I have the fatigue too   It is so frustrating as there is so much I need to get done and the weather is cold and rainy and dull here too so certainly don't have any ambition to walk   I guess this is the mental part of kratom telling us if we just took one dose our energy would return   I am down to 3 1 g per day in 7 divided doses and going to 2 8 g tomorrow   The fatigue seems to get worse the lower I go  Thank goodness from the wonderful people here who let us know that it will get better and better  I'm not sorry about that at all  Appreciate the non drinking company  Keep going  you can do it  And I did something this morning that I have never done before  I poured out my liquor  It smelled awful and I know it would have tasted worse  I will not drink with any of you beautifully  inspirational people today  Keep going you can do it  I'm so sorry for your loss   Relapses suck  but sometimes it can help  It can truly remind you of why you don't drink  That your not there for you SO  family  friends  and most importantly yourself    I love the word you used "accountable"  It's what keeps me in line now  No one else is going to stop me from drinking  from doing it to myself  So I need to stand up  be counted  and be accountable for myself  any other way just leads to disaster  in varying magnitudes    Good luck friend and I wish you the best of luck   I will not drink today  It's my second Day as Well today   I Will happily not drink with you   I also Don't remember the last time I've been sober for a whole week   Go at it one day  one minute at a time   You are strong  Go go go  I got a comprehensive blood panel right before I quit recently  after 5 years of pretty heavy chronic use    My thyroid levels were all pretty normal  except for my FT3 RT3 levels   I've been waiting to get another blood panel to show the real world difference between being on kratom and off   My sex hormones were really low    my estrogen levels  I'm a guy  were basically non existent  which can lead to a number of undesirable effects   But I'm also getting a little older  almost 40   so that could just be part of getting older   Other than that  my cholesterol levels were high  blood sugar was high  and I had some pretty significantly bad inflammation markers   Of course  I don't tend to eat well on kratom   I've quit for about two months now  and while I'm feeling significantly better  I'm still working through some lingering issues   edit  My liver was fine  Good afternoon   Not drinking today   Nope  I will not drink today Exercise  short walks whenever i craved did wonders for me  Seems like I put myself in positions where I have no choice but to make it through those first thirty days  And then by the time you find yourself in a position to cop  you don't quite feel the same about it like you did at day 15  20  etc   I did it last time by moving to the upper peninsula  of MI   "God's Country" they call it  I'm from Flint  This was a culture shock for me    And I didn't have shit but a dufflebag of clothes and an Obama phone  And by the time I'd built myself up again financially  including job  apartment  vehicle   I kinda enjoyed this new way of life  I could hang  And I could leave my doors unlocked and pump gas before I pay    Well  I guess those things are irrelevant  but you get the picture    I made it almost four years clean like that  At the height of it all  for the first time in my life  I had everything  including multiple vehicles  a better salary  all kinds of shit in the house  a girlfriend who loved me  and I was now in my second year as a computer engineering major  Life was running at 150    And then I crashed  Quit going to meetings  made it up to over a fifth of whiskey everyday  trying to drink away all the pressure and stress I was putting myself through going a hundred miles an hour  and wound up in the hospital with pancreatitis  This led to morphine and dilaudid for a couple weeks straight  and once I made it out of the hospital  I hit the ground running for more dope  It was over  The jig was up   I currently have 13 days clean  I have nothing to my name except some clothes  Sleeping on a couch at a relatives  Nowhere to go  nothing to do  and no way to get there    But man  how good it felt just to type all this out  and reminisce about the days I was doing well  how good that felt to be living life right  how much better I felt then than now  and how badly I wanna make it past that first thirty day mark  because next it's sixty  then ninety    And somewhere in there and moving forward  I wanna get my life back     Day 2 sober  Went to AA last night and was told  "You never have to drink again " It was a relief  I don't have a ton of support at home and was greeted by my sister essentially telling me my problem is not that bad  Sure I blacked out 4 times this past week  but two weeks ago I was able to drink all day and not pass out    So today  despite whatever I face when I get home  I'm not drinking  I have never experienced vertigo from weed withdrawal but we are all different  In my research  I don't recall it ever being mentioned as a symptom though   It probably would be a good idea to talk to Your doctor   Falling out of bed is pretty serious stuff  I think you've got the right mindset  Try the month out and then re evaluate    When I got to the month mark I knew I could keep going  so I did  Glad you're here    Yeah  I've finished about 4 ml of vegetable glycerin just vaping  trying to replace the feeling of having a cigarette in hand  I spent the evening trying to manipulate a friend of mine  who smokes  into giving me a cigarette  and realised I was bargaining for it  trying to get even half a cigarette  or just a drag  Good on him for not letting me have any  and as of 59 minutes ago I'm 24 hours clean  I'd still love a crisp  deep hit of dokha though  Damn  Good thing I ran out  It took a lot to not take a detour and grab a bottle  I've taped up my pipe and stashed it away  Just need one more day    One more day  Any good book recommendations  I want to start reading again but don't know where to start  Congrats on 17 days  I'll not drink with you today  Yes  I'm only 2 weeks in  but I've spent a hell of a lot less time zoned out  in my head  worrying about nonsense  You might have been distracted by the images to feel these feelings before   I'm the same way  I hate that about myself but I've also learned to accept it  I realize that is the only way for me to grow as a person  I wish you the absolute best of luck  Take pride in the steps you've taken so far   Good work    Keep it up  you got this   and your whole future ahead of you  After having to reset my badge with over 130 days  I'm with you on not drinking today  I want my sexuality to be something beautiful and not to be my enemy   I feel you  but I think I tend to get lackadaisical with my quitting tapering schedule  Part of trying to discipline myself has to do with learning to suck it up and quit cold turkey  It's super tough   and I'm trying to figure out whether or not I should allow myself to smoke at least occasionally  enjoy a good cigar every now and then  maybe once a month  But I need to not 'need' cigarettes first  And this feels like the best way to dive in  Sink or swim   Sorry for the verbosity  by the way   it helps me clear my head and keep going just a little bit longer   Thank you for your positive post  There aren't any downsides to quitting  I'm looking forward to being mentally sharp again I'm in  As they say in AA  you'll never see a grateful recovering alcoholic drunk    I'm so glad you feel that way  It's a really good place to be  I will not drink with you today  Yes  but it's not just from quitting weed  It also comes from my massive shift in lifestyle that has come with it  I actually try to make healthy choices instead of taking the lazy  zoned out path  I now work out almost daily  eat far healthier than I ever have and actually take the time to work on personal hygiene  So it really wasn't just weed but a total shift in habit  Congrats  That's a huge accomplishment  If he trying to stop yes  anything like porn can make us want porn  But it is probably more healthy  he can think of you and some of the fun times you've had together  Better than porn for hours  The K9 thing I think you can look at over net  you don't need to be near his pc etc  But I'd caution against becoming porn police  if he stops he needs to want to not just cause you'll see  he'll just use other devices if he really wants too   Forgot to check in yesterday  but still solid  Been having urges lately   Way to go  You are going to make it  The hardest days are still to come  but believe me when I tell you  they will be over before you know it  Today makes 19 days for me  The first week sucks bad  but the next week is MUCH easier  To help with my sleeping and the nausea  I found that a caffeine free tea "Sleepy time" worked  Try to avoid caffeine for a bit of you can  Keep trying to eat  even if it is only a couple bites  You can do this  You are strong and brave and you can make it  Freedom is just around the corner  my friend  Keep up with this group  and when the urges hit you  just read through other people's posts  You will see so many similarities in our stories  You see not alone  Once you are able to  I found that the thing that really helped ME the most is encouraging others that haven't made it as far as you yet  It reinforces my desire to quit  Stay strong  Better days are coming  Listen  you and your troll are not bad  You are not a bad defective irreparable person   I'd like to start out by saying that if you are truly bisexual or gay  this is mot a bad thing   But one of the things about porn addiction is that people frequently up the ante with what they view  and many times to the point of shock factors that they are disgusted with  or even porn that doesn't suit their sexual preferences  THIS IS COMMON   Don't beat yourself up over this   The reason for this is simply neurocircuitry and reward chemicals  not some evil demon hiding inside of you or that you're fundamentally flawed    The male prostate is an errogenous zone  and even slme heterosexual couples engage in male anal play  but like I said  if you are bi or gay  there's nothing wrong with that   Just remember that your porn repertoire does not necessarily distinguish your sexual preferences    You said what has been seen cannot be unseen  which is true  but you also said what has been done cannot be undone   This is not true   I highly recommend going to the website yourbrainonporn com  and getting into sex addiction counseling  preferably someone who uses cognitive behavioral techniques   They will not judge you  and theyve heard it all     I just want you to know that this is the addiction making you feel this way and leading you down this path  not you   And I want you to know that this addiction does not define you   There is a way out of this   Porn addiction has a pretty high suicide rate compared to other addictions  and I'm really worried that you say there's the troll that wants you to kill yourself   Please get some help with a sex addiction counselor as soon as possible   They can and will help you through this fristrating  shameful addiction that is much more common than anyone thinks   YOU ARE  NOT A BAD PERSON  THIS  IS  COMMON FOR PORN ADDICTION  YOU ARE A  GOOD  PERSON   Good luck and big hugs  3 One thing that has helped me with this is practicing meditation  Believe me  I started out being terrible at meditation  and I still am not so great  but it is starting to help me be more at peace and uncomfortable in given moment  I believe in you  You can do this   the sex addiction groups are great  you can really share and hear how others are like you   Whether I'm labeled as an alcoholic or not doesn't really matter  All that does is that I know without a shadow of a doubt that my life is better without it    That's the reason I'm not drinking today  Yeah dude  dudette    that's the worst feeling  I've been there before and I'm going there again soon  smoking my last gram then I'm going clean again  Your dreams will probably be stopping just as mine are starting Lol  I bought Cerise Limn one time and my daughter tried it   She loved it just as much as I do  so we try to always have it on hand   She likes the carbonation and the flavor being "pure" with no additives   I also found Canada Dry has some that seem similarly without the additives   We like the Raspberry   http   www canadadry com products sparkling seltzer water Don't let it get you down dude  One of the main reasons people turn back to drugs even when they don't want to is because of emotional pain    Realising it is a huge positive  It gives you the opportunity to change things for the better   High 5 bro  Its no different then quitting smoking  you stopped smoking but didn't cut the nicotine  thats what is "driving you nuts" right now   withdrawal from your drug    I promise  you can do this  and I thought I had an oral fixation and every other excuse there is to not quit for years    truth be told  I was just lying to myself    there was no fixation    I do not miss the action of smoking or any of the shit that goes with it truth is  everything in life is better without smoking    Thats awesome  I'm at 4 weeks now and it feels like its been a long time but at the same time it really doesn't so keep it up man you'll be there in no time  Love this  Thank you  these are the reasons I also chose to finally just give it up for good  It is hard to explain to people that it doesn't really matter if they think I have a problem or not  it only matters if I think it's a problem and there is nothing wrong with just wanting to be the best me if I know that means being sober  Your sober time isn't lost   Be kind to yourself   best wishes  Food   I'll get some takeout like sushi of BBQ from one of my favorite places  and usually splurge on one of the pricier meals  It takes time  but not as much as you'd think     I can't believe how much I was hurting myself  My anxiety was always extreme  and I thought I was helping it    Now  my mood swings are less dramatic  and I am better able to healthily express my anxiety  anger and frustrations in life  You'll get there  Faster than you think   I define success as abstinence today  I have sober milestones that I'm looking forward to  but I'm a big fan of taking it one day at a time so I don't get overwhelmed by the what ifs and slide into the bargaining trap  For me  the bargaining trap happens when I try to imagine myself never drinking again  When I do that  I think ahead to major life events or good times ahead and try to imagine those not drinking  That becomes overwhelming  so I start bargaining about how I will drink in the future  "I'll just drink on holidays  or weddings  or during trips   " Before I know it  I'm not only accepting that as an inevitability  I'm bargaining to drink in the present  Maybe I can have one or two once a week  So I do that and end up right back where I started  I've bargained many  many times  and I've never kept up my end of the bargain  Alcohol has always won  You could also include taxis  if applicable   It's insane how much money I spent on alcohol  I channeled half the savings to my grocery budget and the other half to big purchases  It means I can magically afford fresh veg and fish even though my incoming money didn't change  When the hoover broke down last year  it was replaced without any problems  It all makes me feel safe and rich  Yah  what a totally crappy parable that was enjoyable to read and super helpful   I won't be drinking right along with you  I wish we had LaCroix in the UK  it sounds like there is a ton of variety  I like drinking Schloer or Appletiser but they are both way too sweet to drink too much of  Regular carbonated water is good for me     Thank you   Pamplemousse forever  or as my husband calls it  "your hipster grapefruit seltzer " Congratulations on wanting to quit  I know for me the first time I quit I didn't understand how to stop enjoying it either  This time  after relapsing for two months  I'm spending more time correcting myself  Remembering that I don't enjoy smoking  My brain gets wired that way from the addiction and it's not my fault  and all I have to do is do something else  Meditate  take a walk  take a deep breath and remember cigarettes never did anything for me  I can relax just fine without one  I wish you the strength you need  you can do this  No sorry  Only celebrate  Great job  I have to say  I do feel more clear headed now   Good luck friend  I was about to do the same  Sorry to be raunchy  but what about anal sex with your wife   That must be so hard for you guys with her pain in her vagina   Maybe have her stimulate her clit while you experiment with anal   It's pretty awesome if done right for women too  I'm okay with a good fucking blow up because if I see one more "long time lurker  first time poster" I feel like I'm going to explode   If you were really a long time lurker than you should know what you're typing is what drives us to abuse the piss out of you   TO be honest when I first posted one of my fucked up escapades  I had never read the sidebar   I was always on mobile and just never looked at it really   But I was a lurker and had commented on enough posts and read so much that I never would've considered doing an intro   Oh and hold on and let me tell you how much and how long I have been drinking cuz that fucking matters  Remember that there are people envious of YOU  for having the balls to say no  They are still stuck in their own heads  Don't throw away the long term future for some shitty short term mental bandaid  You can be an inspiration for others  Stay strong    It's good you have recognised this at your age    Absolutely   It took me until my forties    Yeah hes very smart  he could hide anything if he truly wanted too and from what I gather he usually uses his tablet to watch porn when he used too  Ill just trust his word  that feels much better than policing him    Thanks for all the advice and input  I really appreciate it   I remember my first few days  the constant worry over how I would handle all the situations that I  thought  alcohol made better  Would I be able to stick to my plan and say no  especially when I felt the pressure to partake with friends  What about holidays  What about game night  What about what about what about      These anxious thoughts held me prisoner to alcohol  the fear of how I would handle everything made me paralyzed to change    The truth is that I handled each situation one at a time  one day at a time  No  it wasn't easy  but it was far easier than I had anticipated it being    You can do this  one day at a time  Let tomorrow worry about itself     Good luck and best wishes    A T  Why would you go to Thailand tho  Check out some of the rehabs in Florida they're some of the best  Weed is not the answer to solving this  but you probably have some deep shit to work through    Are you doing okay man  Lime and grapefruit are my go to's  Now and then I like plain  I like my drinks to have fizz but can do without any sweetness so LaCroix is perfect for me   Ouch   It sounds like You are between a rock and a hard place   Ever consider a complete lifestyle change   It really doesn't sound to me like Your current life situation is sustainable over the long haul without serious harm   Alcohol is a wicked drug   Please use it with extreme caution    I understand Your fear   I would be too   I think You need to take a serious look at what You want out of life and who are the most supportive people to help You   Just one or two clean friends that are on the straight and narrow would be so wonderful for You to have right now   In the absence of such friends    You have to be Your Own Support System   Don't exchange your weed addiction for an alcohol addiction   Just fucking don't   Suck it up   Don't smoke   If You must drink      drink very little   Geez   You don't even like it     have a sparkling water instead with a twist of lime   Get clean   Your thinking will be clearer   You will find answers to Your problems   Use Your fear to scare Yourself Straight    I know it isn't easy   Anything of value is never easy   You can do this   Keep posting   Keep coming back here    And insurance will pay for them 22 is a good age to quit  I wasted my early 20's drinking  and I regret it so much  I will not drink with you today  I will not drink today      So did I to begin with  I now think the same about sobriety    It probably doesn't help that I actually have ocd     even though I'm on meds for it I definitely used drinking to forget about it    You know how they say that guys think about sex every like 6 seconds or something  That's how I feel about alcohol right now   Ya man just stick with it  One craving at a time  After a couple months you'll begin to realize how much that addiction manipulated you  All of my friends still smoke and I see how much their brains constantly remind them  crave  to smoke versus mine   Even my husband who has been the most affected by my drinking was shocked when I told him I was quitting for good   "not even one occasionally "  But even though he saw me overdrink all the time  he did not hear the constant war going on in my head   and that's difficult to explain to people  As far as I can tell  the rehabs here are insanely more expensive  for the same or worse quality of treatment  But I'm open to recommendations if you have them  I think elliot Smith was a wonderful musician and singer and creative soul    But his lyrics and thoughts seem to amplify the tragedy of the common man so much for me   He ended up dead with two stab wounds through the chest at 34  They still don't know if he did it or what   What a way to go    Too young to die and too old of a soul to want to go on  Kickass        Day 10  look how far you've come already   Best anniversary gift ever   Congratulations on both     x Thank you from the bottom of my heart  I just subscribed to a anon group for myself  I know I will need counceling to help successfully get him through recovery  I don't want to be envasive but have to make clear boundaries as to my role in his recovery  Thank you again for the detailed response  3  I'm not what I'd consider "new"   But nah I don't have a flair because I just don't care to  Like they don't even load all the way on my phone app unless they're only one or two words long so fuck it  What does having a flair have to do with anything    And you can easily go back and read super old posts   Shit posting didn't just start happening one day haha  this place has  always  had a lot of shitposts   She said above she'd been here around 2 years  but shit posting was 100  just as much a thing back then as it is now  And back then people were saying "oh this sub has went to shit" and people could point out that two years prior to then  people were still making dumb drunk as fuck shitposts and intros and all that   And maybe it's because I'm a worthless drunk in real life but I still don't see a need for multiple accounts   If someone sees the account what are they gonna do realize someone is an alcoholic  Pretty sure most people in most of our lives have already known this for a long time  kinda impossible to hide being CA   If you're that much of a grown up with so many important responsibilities how ca are you  Fuck it I figure     Pretty much only have a reddit account because of Nofap  Feel like I've really tackled that addiction into almost nothing now  but finding myself these days filling my free time with smoking weed instead of doing all the great things that got me off porn in the first place  exercise  study  entrepreneurship etc   How goes your recovery  Yeah  My first cigarette made me dizzy as fuck  It actually stressed me out more  Then I felt very proud that I'd be able to do it with my friends without looking inexperienced  8 billion cigarettes later  yeah  I got tricked into believing it was "relaxing" me  Truth is the sub is ever evolving and your going to have mostly shitposts with a few quality posts scattered in there    The newbies are always going to be finding their footing and will complain how insular the group is  The seasoned veterans will complain about the newbies who never seem to read the sidebar    Because the CA lifestyle is generally not a sustainable lifestyle  the great storytellers find themselves coming to crossroads and their stories become fewer and farther between   And in all this chaos  the mods try to keep some semblance with order while trying not to quash the creative spirit that is this place  But please don't encourage them to clean this place of the douchbags  I wouldn't know where else to go       Look at all those 4's going on      D x Thanks for this op  I've never heard of this condition before   I was diagnosed with ibs a few years into my chronic smoking  the symptoms don't quite match  vomiting is quite rare for me  but everything else    yeah  I always felt smoking aleviated my symptoms  now I've quit my stomach feels worse than it's felt in a long time    Reading about this condition I wonder if the long term use did me more harm than good in that regard  I can relate to this a lot   Yay for a comfy workspace  A nice fancy dinner complete with desert  Thanks Upchuck  What a lovely name     I mean yeah  I'm doing fine except the sleeping part  It's like the worst tho  I work  I'm in grad school  all my relatonships do not revolve around weed  It's the nightly boredom and sleep that irks me  The day time stuff  I'm literally fine  So  idk    I just don't like these awful dreams I have  They're legitimately frightening   We can have a 5 party tomorrow    D x This is seriously me  I have a great career  good friends  active hobbies  I've never gotten into any major trouble with my drinking  Never done anything to permanently ruin my life  But for a while now there has been this nagging that I DO drink too much  I DO have a problem  even if it's not the wake up in a ditch  giving blow jobs for vodka horror story you hear people talk about when they talk about alcoholics  Most of the time when I drink I do keep it to a couple beers or less  But like you  every so often it goes off the rails and I wind up entirely useless and feeling like shit for an entire day after  "But I didn't do anything ridiculous while drunk " I told myself  "It's not so bad  just a hangover  everyone gets those " Or on a less extreme  I may not go totally wild but I'd drink just a bit too much and be off my game at work  Or I'd justify skipping out on a workout for my hobby that I'm trying to get competitive at  At bare minimum it has been keeping me from pursuing things that I want to do to improve  Lately my hangovers have been getting worse and more frequent and I realize I'm a place where I must make a change  I definitely have a problem    I'm not fully ready to commit to giving up alcohol forever  But I am going to commit to not drinking between now and my first big event for my hobby  just shy of three months from now  I need to take this day by day  I don't want to share this with any people in my life until I have put in some days and passed the 2 week mark  at least  But I'm sharing with you guys to help keep me accountable now that it's out there   I like the taste because it's familiar  Not because it tastes good  But because I got roped into believing it was my mostly companion  I'll probably take a long time to unravel the mess of associations in my life with smoking but if I cut them a break and keep saying they taste so good and I miss them  I'll never make the progress I need to in order to avoid a relapse  That's what happened my first time and I have to try a different approach this time for sure   Bum  need to control them thoughts big it thanks for calling in  best luck in 2017 to all challengers and reads of sub  I found other water flavour things that are delicious   This one's good although I prefer their coconut flavour  http   imgur com 0BELMER Checking in  good luck to everyone  Great to see you   I won't drink with you today x That's the part I disagree with as well   I've enjoyed cigs without the nicotine craving     It is physically giving us something   You said no one likes the taste of cigs   That's just not true   I used to not understand how people liked beer  coffee  green beans  etc etc     I tried cigs  on my own  with no friends encouraging me  around 20ish  13 years ago   I liked them  even on the first cig   I was a weed smoker already  so I didn't have issues figuring out how to smoke  or choking on it     But I liked it     My body wasn't craving nicotine  it had never had it  Sounds like a good plan      Great post  It good to hear your doing so well   keep it up  Yeah I getcha I'm just not big on the groups  Can get the same thing accomplished with my drug councilor minus the stress and anxiety of meeting new people when I'm at my lowest  I already have enough of that  I can't handle anymore   it's hard   my boyfriend doesn't understand   he says i should just vape and gradually stop but i know my body  if I give myself the option  I will always choose to keep vaping  He says I make no sense  I feel like I don't have a shoulder to lean on or understand why I want to do this for me and my daughter    I'm also 22 and this is also my 2nd day sober  Our stories are literally the same  I embarrassed myself so bad and feel so much remorse that I'm trying to put the bottle down for good  We can do this  I will not drink with you today  Already feeling the work stress drawing me towards the pub at 5  but I will not drink today  I created a reddit account specially for this  Another porn free day fought and won  Cheers to all   Uploading 500 pairs of brandspanky new awesome Adidas sneakers       D x Good luck dude  I dunno just as my dreams start too kick it down a notch that nightmare kicks into gear again haha just pops up randomly as a reminder of how I felt going through those times  Of the ones I have tried  I love the grapefruit and cran raspberry  Lime and Lemon are refreshing but not my fave  Coconut is weird  It kind of tastes like sunscreen but also like coconut    Haha   no  but you might want to reset your friendships if your friend knows that you aren't watching porn and still did that  If your friend doesn't know  time to man up and tell them "hey  I don't look at that shit anymore  so please don't send me any " And mine    I dunno that I really focused on weight much  just more or less kept tabs on it   I think for the first month or two of sobriety I replaced alcohol with food when I had to do something to satisfy that craving   After the addiction eased up a bit  it became easier to eat sensibly and let my body do the rest   Seems like when I'm good to it  it's good to me right back  The first time I smoked was by myself  with no peer pressure  13 years ago   I truly enjoyed the first drag  and the taste  I didn't even notice that  Thanks    love this Are you me  I feel exactly the same way  and I go through the same motions  I agree with others who said that we need a better reward system  Do NOT reward yourself with video games  or with anything remotely addictive  You might spiral down a path that is infinitely harder to pull out of  Easily the best book I've ever read  Wow  Your assessment of "problem" is eerily similar how I described myself in response to someone trying to figure out whether they should stop drinking   right down to the "best version of myself " Check it out   "This is exactly how I would describe my drinking  and from the other responses  there seem to be plenty of us that would similarly characterize ourselves  In more concrete terms  I would have 2 3 IPAs almost every night at home  and up to twice as much when out socially  Thankfully  I don't have anything resembling a rock bottom story like so many others on here  and I doubt friends and family would say I have an issue with alcohol  For me  it was useful to get away from labels  such as "problem drinking" or "alcoholism " and focus on the realization that I wasn't presenting the best version of myself  physically and emotionally  as a drinker  Put another way  I simply wanted to stop so that I'd have a clear head 100  of the time  eat and sleep better  have better focus during athletic training  and free up time in the evenings to do something beyond drinking beer and watching ESPN  Past attempts to simply cut down  or limit drinking to weekends or social occasions  worked well until they didn't  I'd be fine for a few weeks  or even months  but would gradually revert to my everyday drinking pattern  What I did find during those times of cutting back that I felt much better physically  and was far more engaged with those around me  yet I still figured I could have my proverbial cake and eat it too  So 30 days ago I decided to simply stop for good  and I'm feeling great with that choice  I'm already realizing all the benefits I'd hoped for  and more  Small things like being able to watch a movie without forgetting how it ends  and large things like being more emotionally engaged with my wife  have been unforeseen upsides that I hadn't even imagined  Whatever you decide  sharing your story has made me feel less alone  So thank you for that  and best of luck "  Good to see others are coming to the same conclusion  and not thinking some "rock bottom" scenario is required to make the positive change  Thanks for sharing  Ever since I was young  I've had issues with insomnia from time to time  What works for me more often than not is not paying attention to the thoughts  Specifically  I allow brain to race and do its thing without fighting it  It is always worse when I become frustrated about it  so I do my best to accept that it's happening and not focus on the thoughts  It's like having talk radio on in the background but doing some task so that I'm not following along  Sometimes I'll repeat "sleep" to myself  sometimes I'm able to simply not attend to the thoughts  and sometimes I'll have to get out of bed and accept that I might not get enough sleep that night   After the first few days of not drinking  I got better at going right to sleep when I'm tired  Reading just before bed helps  too   I look at what I need to make my life better in any way  organise  streamline  improve  remove small hassles  etc  The first thing I bought was a spiralizer because it allows me to cook healthier meals  which is in line with my priorities  Then a nice deep ceramic pan so that the courgetti doesn't go all over the hob  An ottoman to store the stuff for knitting and crochet so that it looks neat and is easily accessible  Towel rails for the bathroom so that they can dry well  Yesterday  I bought new knives so that my husband and I can both cook at the same and not fight over the chef's knife  The other week   new pillows so that we sleep more comfortably  In November   curtains for the living room to make it warmer and darker  and nicer looking   We also replaced our PC monitors because the old ones were flickering  There's more lol    I have been trying to quit drinking since last November and that's when I made a list of what I would like to have  There's only lap trays on it now and we're getting them next week  All those things made my life easier but I used to prioritise alcohol over everything else and it turned into a vicious circle  Seeing all those new things motivated me to quit again every time I did decide to drink  They were a proof of change  a visible reminder that sobriety is worth it  It turns out that 700 was all I needed to spend to be happy  Good job on 50 days   The first 30 were an absolute bitch for me  and things got progressively better once I got past 60 and 90 days   Stay strong  and good luck in the new year     Checking in   Let's try this again  I have a quick question  When do you guys start your clean date time  At your last dose  Or when you start feeling withdrawal symptoms and know it's out of your system  I would just like to know for myself  sorry if I'm hijacking your post  a favorite quote that has helped me many times   before only one thing made me happy    now that it is gone  everything makes me happy      For me  to NOT count the days I don't do something  and  rather  to just live them  is the ultimate goal   I'd take it as a sign of nearing Yoda level Jedi powers      x Glad to be of help  Wish my poison of choice was wine  Spirits are waaaay too easy to go from sober to blackout  Day 3 was easy for me as I stayed in my jimjams  so today was the test  Future me is gonna be so happy I passed  Mind  the day is not over yet     and I live a minute's walk from an offy  liquor store  and three mins from one that's open 24 7  x  Edit  Can't spell a simple word  Measure once and cut  Ack  x I fucking enjoyed smoking after a raid wipes in world of warcraft  Raid Leading was straight stressful yo After about 13 years of daily smoking  I'm curious to find out who I really am  where my natural emotional equilibrium falls  Am I actually an anxious person  or has it been the weed all along  Maybe I'll find I'm really a pretty optimistic and happy person  once the smoke has cleared  It's going to be an interesting ride  Congrats  Day 2 for me also  I will not drink with you today  Hey bud  I remember your name as I also started browsing this sub around 2014  Just wanted to say that I have also had my ups and downs with abstaining from League since then but i'm rooting for you    Get back on the horse and focus on the rule of 3  3 days  3 weeks  3 months    You got this   edit typo Congrats on your decision  Day 2 for me and I will not drink with you today  I've been having fairly traumatic dreams  as far as dreams go  and it makes sleep difficult  I used to wake up in the middle of the night all the time and would have trouble falling back asleep before I found weed  Now that I'm dankrupt  that problem has come back  I hope you can find some peace soon man  True crime and war memoirs    all    fucking    day    Sub is fine  people just like to bitch  I would think that a sub centered around alcoholism NOT having a bunch of shitposts wouldn't make sense    Plus I don't see why people worry if this sub gets shit posts when vast majority of the regulars here post on multiple other smaller private CA subs  Thanks Pintas  We are gaining time at night  Thanks for your support  x Yes  we see our progress and our relapses in real time  I'm reading Anne Grace's  This Naked Mind  it's in the side bar for free  and it's opening my eyes to what is really internally happening with my addiction  I wish I read this book when I was your age  so I thought I'd suggest it  Here's to beating this beast  I'm in  I will not drink with you all today  I am sorry for your heartbreaking loss  Messaged the mods with link to the post  let's see how it turns out  Keep going dude  you are over half way through the worst  it probably won't get any worse than it is now  You have some good meds to help  just be sure to keep hydrated and eat what ever you can stomach  Keep going mate  a few days of suffering is worth a life time of freedom     Congrats   You can do a month so easily  Don't get deterred   keep it going   I'd gold you if I could afford to  Thank you  I posted here about a week ago  complaining about how awful I felt on christmas eve  Today is my 11th day clean from subs  and while I'm having minor wd symptoms  for the most part I feel like a new man    I heard suboxone would take well over a month to start feeling better but I swear the past few days have been like I'm a kid again  I'm so glad that I stuck to this and am not dependant on a drug to exist daily    I want to shout out  u tigerplex who has kept up correspondance and given great advice and comforting words during my personal hell that was the first week and a half clean  and I wanna thank this sub for being a constant reminder that I can do this  no matter how bad it gets  Thank you guys for existing and sorry for shitty formatting and wall of text       edit  words Berry reminds me of cough syrup  Yuck o  "don't compare yourself to other  compare yourself to the best possible version of you"   That's powerful  Thank you You put this so eloquently Fap   I was just commenting to another regular that if we don't post our crazy stories all we will see is shitposts      But sometimes it's exhausting and sometimes you have to take a break otherwise die or land in rehab or jail   CA life is definitely not sustainable   I'm currently trying to take another break myself   Day 2 of sobriety   Working out and drinking water   I could not possibly imagine trying to be a mod at this fucking sub   Way too much responsibility for me     The tags on the posts for the last couple of days are fucking hilarious though  Day 2 here as well  You got this  Thanks Yoga  Think you replied to a comment I made the other day  or I replied to yours     OMG my mind is still recovering from all that poison  Bluugghh  x Thanks guys  I just coughed up some gnarly black shit    ie my lungs are cleaning myself out   I accepted the fact that I cannot moderate any kind of responsible cannabis use  and that I do  in fact  have a drug problem   Relapse will fuck me up  It isn't an option for me   Hopefully  I can stop using benadryl and GABA to fall asleep within the next few weeks   I stopped associating with drug addict friends  They were a bad influence on me  if you have an xb1 i would love to play with you and try to help ease some of that boredom  pm me if you ever need a friend  this sub has been good to me and I'd love to be able to help anyone I can  You're good dude  I personally have mine right on the nose of my last dose  time and date  I was tapering a bit so I was already feeling shitty  You can do it  It's all in your head  which might I add does not take away from the severity of the situation  so hang in there  Take a deep breath of the fresh clean air  You've been high for a long time  now it's time to explore your sober mind for a little while  Good luck  Welcome back  My anxiety is always worse when I drink  especially if I haven't eaten anything  A couple of my first days consisted of getting hydrated  a brothy soup with crackers and an electrolyte sports drink worked well for me  and a decent meal once I could stomach it  After that  I'd spend some more time on here     I am so sorry you're going through such a painful time   We're glad you found us    SD is a very safe and supportive place to land  and journeying along with The Sobernauts through all our struggles and triumphs has saved my life more than a few times when alcohol tried its best to win   Hang in there    I'll do today with you x I'm 23  and I feel this completely  Three days in for me  wishing you and everyone else all the very best in this massive lifestyle change  Thanks FTC  Triggers eh  Can't wait till not drinking becomes the norm  x Thank you  It's gone surprisingly smooth so far  I've had some real struggles early on  mostly due to going through a horrific breakup  but I feel like I'm really hitting my stride now  we understand here    just keep posting here    3 days is like a tipping point honestly  if you can make it through today it starts to get easier   drink ice water like your life depends on it  and take short walks  you'll be amazed how it helps  Yeah I feel the stomach hunger too  Like a slight feeling of gas and emptiness but no appetite to match  Sucks indeed but just a few more days Oh and when I'm really bored I'll go back at look at posts from years ago   People have been bitching about shitposts and newbies for the last 6 years    It's funny to read  What kind of alcohol was it  Also people do care and there will always be people who care and relate to you  You just have to find them  Ok  I'm an alcoholic and spent 5 days in the hospital for detoxing and tests   At that time  I wanted so much to stop  but couldn't   I couldn't ask for help until I was so far gone  I had to be hospitalized    It was the worst days of my life  but also my best days   I was finally getting help that I couldn't ask for   I know my case may be different   it seems a lot of people show on your doorstep without an inkling of wanting to stop   But a lot of us do   we're going to be angry  depressed and physically feeling horrendous   Also  most of us will lie to you   It's not your fault  but we tend not to show our real selves     What you do is nothing short of God's work   giving help to those in need who can't or won't ask for it   Empathy is something a lot of alcoholics need   There were a couple of nurses that treated me like scum  and it really made a lasting impression   But the positive things also go a long way   It may not stick the first time  or at all for some   but eventually it will sink in   Sometimes slowly  sometimes quickly    For the nightly boredom  try and find a replacement habit for the smoking  Art  programming  anything really  And I really recommend doing some meditation before bed  even as you are laying down going to sleep  If you need some help with guided stuff  download the application  Insight Timer  https   www insighttimer com  and do some of the guided Yoga Nidra meditations  They really help   Also  to work through them  you should try writing them down  Just simply do your best to remember them  even if not pleasant  Then let go of them through a short meditation after journaling them  Yeah but I like how he amplifies those feelings for me  Used to  anyway  Now all his songs are mostly just nostalgic and take me back to memories from 10  years ago   I tend to really like musicians who struggled with stuff like addiction or heavy depression though  Sparklehorse is a like Smith for me nowadays partly because that dude killed himself too   I think Smith did do suicide    Piano Fire is usually what I listen to when I feel like being drunk and just pacing the house thinking    Do you find St John's wort or multivits make a difference  Good luck man lol   naa   i just needed an alt account   something not related to my usual screenname across the internet     vogel is bird in dutch  or german  I'm with you   It doesn't even sound fun anymore  I just made a post about saving money being a positive motivator to stick with this thing  It's sobering  pun intended  once you start adding up all the receipts   Thanks wompwompwomp27  Were all the other wompwompwomp names taken      Who would've thought that would be such a popular user name  We live and learn  eh      As someone who is on day 11 off of subs I promise you can do this  I had more symptoms in the first week or so from ANXIETY from thinking about the WDs than the actual WDs themselves  I found out the hard way that your mondset and fear can really make the whole experience 100x worse  I have the most addictive personality ever and I made it  I believe you can too buddy  I will not drink today  Thanks Nutty  I misread your name as Nutty Fish  But either way  thanks for the support  I need it  x "He who makes a beast of himself gets rid the pain of being a man "  Hunter S Thompson I have been involuntarily fasting for the last couple days  Let's hope it does help indeed   You're a wonderful friend and I wish you both the best of luck  WHEEE   You're always such an inspiration here  especially at an occasion like dis    D  I'd type you 600 x hugs  but Reddit gets a little funky when posting characters like that LOL Super happy to hear it  You got this   Also follow this link for instructions on how to get a badge  http   www reddit com r StopGaming comments 1c34r8 badge bot instructions  Did I wake up in the middle of the night and write this in my dreams  It's basically my exact story  Thanks so much for posting  Let's do this  Yeah I owe it to myself to just go ahead and do it  I can't live like this anymore Mine is focus  I am constantly distracted and have too many hobbies so I never become good at any of them  This will hopefully lead me to playing more guitar  writing more and reading more  Do you vape the nicotine free juices  Thank you friend  it's good to know I'm not going through it alone From my experience  the odds of a nurse stopping "repeat offenders" is as low as that of family members  Addicts don't stop until they hit a bottom they don't like  My advice  gently point out the insanity of their situation and tell them they don't have to live that way any more  if they don't want to  There is a way out and you would love to help  if they wanted it The truth is that a lot of addicts will die from this  We are some of the most heartbreaking and heart warming people you will ever meet  depending on the road they take   Remind them they are not alone  life doesn't have to be this way any more and they can get better   We are not bad people trying to become good  we are sick people trying to get well It gets better slowly but surely   Be gentle with yourself and treat yourself this week   It helped me to remind myself I have been through hell   smoking again just restarts the hell  I don't want to quit again    The hard part is behind you   Violence is never acceptable   We did not cause it  we cannot cure it  and we cannot control it  However  we as the loved ones can contribute  I learned the part that I played in my family dysfunction even though I wouldn't consider myself a dysfunctional person     I can't tell you if you're mistaken  I can ask a few questions to help you think about your role in that drama     Were you at your mom's house  Why     When you sent the text   why did you send it to your mom  What was your intention  To hurt her  To get her to quit drinking  So she might understand the anguish and sadness you feel over situation like this      Did you text accomplish that goal     If not  could you have written the text in a way that could have better achieved your goal    I learned in Al Anon that my behavior did contribute to the drama in my family  I've learned and am still learning how to understand and communicate my feelings in a more productive manner     Big hugs  This is a crazy journey if you decide to start practicing the Al Anon program  Best of luck to you  Watch that money pileeeee up   28 pounds in 50 days  holy crap  good for you  41 checking in  I feel physically better than I ever felt when I was drinking   late to check in but still not drinking today  Back to normal work weeks   routines  Great post  Definitely saving and upvoting Aw thank you       I know this may seem strange  but since we never know what happens to our patients  unless the come back   it feels REALLY good to hear from even one person who is sober after going through detox   I'm sorry that anyone treated you like scum   you deserved better   When you talk about lying to nurses  do you mean about your life or your symptoms or all of it   Just out of curiosity   It's obviously hard to tell and some patients can be very manipulative   Also  this is a really weird question  but what was Ativan's effect on you   Did it do more than make you sleepy and less anxious  I don't have the balls to even admit it to my physician  But I'm feeling great today  I have no urges today to drink unless I think about it too much     I feel like i can do it today  I know there will be hard days and I'll probably slip up but right now I'm not trying to be perfect  I'm trying to stop drinking every night  I'm going to set a goal to try and get my drinking down to twice a week  and then once a week until my anti anxiety and depression med kicks in and I learn to cope with stress in the next coming weeks  Thanks everyone for all the support  I'll be on here a lot  Hoping to have control over this by Easter  I'd like something to relieve the cravings and discomfort of the last two years without them   I quit smoking for good reasons  but it wasn't because I  wanted  to  I miss it so much I still have vivid dreams where I'm smoking  and wake up with the smell in my nose and taste in my mouth  Thank you  This is me  Or it was me  until I started to get worse   Congratulations for recognizing and stopping it  Just commenting to say I'm rooting for you  True words   It's kinda hard not to shitpost when you're so wasted you can hardly type  THANK YOU  For sharing this  I so needed to hear this right now  I have had undesirable consequences  including  but not limited to  being useless and unproductive at work but nothing that has caused a clear come to Jesus moment  Every time I get a few sober days and start to feel good a little voice inside me says "you're overreacting  You can have a drink or two because you're not a capital A Alcoholic  You haven't had a DUI and you don't drink a 5th of vodka each night like a real alcoholic does " And then I have one drink  And then another  And then 2 weeks later I've abandoned my health career financial goals and I find myself drinking most days  more than I want to  I also realized that on nights that I have succeeded at having one or two drinks  afterwards thinking "there  see  I don't have a problem "  I always wanted more  Always  Even if I didn't go through with actually getting more  I really appreciate hearing from the people who got sober without the truly horrible consequences because I'm hoping that I can get sober before any of those things happens to me   Are you currently suffering yourself  I ask because I'm in a psych ward  voluntarily   at the moment writing to you from my phone after I had a pretty severe depressed episode at my parent's house and they worried about my safety   Here to hear if you're in need to talk mang   What do you think of bands like electric six  Haha I know it's goofy but that band almost always makes me happy when I listen  definitely german  i chose poorly for my alt account cos it's my favourite username yet   though  still  no one has said that they've got the reference haha   and it's definitely bird in german   "und die Vgel singen nicht mehr"  Rammstein  Already did Tuesday  today work may be a bit stressful but I won't drink today  Get yourself to a meeting    That's quite the dilemma  Some ideas to explore when you get to a meeting    Boundaries   Detachment   Self Care   Learning to stop showing up to the fight  What a story   The good thing is you wont be a part anymore of them   We all have them  by the way  some worse than others  Not drinking today I will not drink today  I'm with you buddy  Free until school starts up on Monday  Free time used to be drunk time but I finally want this more  I will not drink with you today     Are you me  2 3 IPAs at home and twice as much out was pretty much my drinking life  Sounds like we are in the same boat  I cheers my Saranac Root Beer to you  I tried to think of what my best friend would want for me after he died and it would not have been a drunken insane mess   That didn't help me always but it helped me do better at times when I was higher risk   I'm so sorry for your loss   Great points  In my experience  it's been tough to come to terms with the fact that I just can't be all of the things I want to be  in shape  good partner  good son  good coworker  good friend  etc   when I drink regularly  And I have a very hard time with "one or two"   it's almost always 5 or 6  I haven't been hospitalized  arrested  nor have I had any MAJOR life consequences  but I've harmed relationships  and ultimately have done damage to myself   After work I'll drink a seltzer  or two  for us both  Idk  On day 3  I'll let you know  Hopefully it does or at least have a placebo effect   There is no sweetener in LaCroix  it is sparkling water with flavors added  200 days  No drinking today  Next stop  201  I am very glad you are seeking advice on this topic   I never had medically managed detox  I went to rehab for marijuana   so I have no first hand experience with it   I have listened to countless stories over the years from fellow addicts on the subject though   My perspective on the issue comes down to surrender   If the person doesn't see that their life has become unmanageable  detoxing in a hospital is generally not a scheduled chore   what you do for them will rarely be if any consequence   In my area  there are a few AA's who regularly go to the detox of hospitals to share experience  strength  and hope with those in dire need of it   I never believed I could stop getting high without killing myself until I meet people who had done it   They shared their stories  and I related to them more than regular people   I've heard some recovering addicts alcoholics mention nurses physicians who led them to AA NA   I don't know if there is anything more you can do than what you said you have done   I knew I was ruining my life and the lives of those around me for years  but I got high enough to ignore the guilt   I'm around 2 5 years sober and I'm still barely learning how to be an independent 28 year old   I still feel act like I'm 16 most of the time  which was when I started drinking     Your doing incredible work  it just won't show up in most of our memories because most of get high one more time and forget the person who saved our lives the last time  I honestly like them I shoulda guessed you fuckers were Zappa philes  Honestly  while I would absolutely love having kids  and being a mom is a lifelong dream of mine  I am realistic about the probability that it's not for me   My psychological hangups around alcohol and drugs are so severe that I know I couldn't bear one of my children becoming a drinker  and it's more likely than not that they would  I'm not religious  so it's not like I'd raise them Mormon or something similarly sober  but    I don't know  I'll probably wind up having them  but it's a big risk for me  Thank you for this inspiration  I like coconut and peach pear LaCroix best  Pamplemousse is my least favorite  but I love the Perrier grapefruit   I just bought bottles of Polar black cherry  cranberry lime  orange vanilla  and grapefruit  and Poland Spring strawberry and cucumber melon  Might as well experiment  Myself personally  I had a super hot lesbian affair with the married woman who introduced me to this sub    so I needed a reddit account she was not privy to after the affair ended  My marriage  now open  is a pretty important responsibility that in no way prevents me from being a CA  Its more like being a CA prevents some from marrying    Is your goal here to make me not like you or something  Yeah  absolutely not  People are going to try to get you to do so  and there's no reason to  You're not missing anything worthwhile  and you're missing plenty of stuff that isn't  Did not enjoy the dizziness from my first few cigarettes  As the youngest person in this generation of my family  I just wanted to do what everyone else was doing  I "enjoyed" smoking right up until I wanted to quit  then every last cigarette was agonizing self hatred while I was in a constant battle to take a deep enough drag to get my fix before I started coughing again   The more months I put between me and my last puff of anything with nicotine  the more I realize my brains incredible ability to lie to myself  I don't remember ever enjoying a cigarette  I only remember needing a cigarette  The only joy at all was some social event I enjoyed while having a smoke  that I believed was because of the smoke  now I know it could have been a carrot addiction instead  Focus only on getting though this specific craving  It will pass  1 step at a time  resist making excuses  Only YOU can do this but we're here for you   I'm looking forward to funding some hobbies based solely on not drinking   I've been bored as well now that the holidays are over  and just like you  it's not even like I have nothing to do  I guess I'd call it lack of motivation  I def  notice some of the same symptoms  but like you said it's hard to tell what is kratom related and what is thyroid related  Did you ever notice any swelling in your neck   I'm only 8 and a half months in  so I find myself having to mentally battle it less and less   What I remind myself is that if I don't drink today I'm not going to feel like shit when I wake up tomorrow    I have no comments on the new look  I perfer the old one as I'm used to it but seeing as I'm firmly in the non smoking camp  whatever works for you guys    This comment is a thank you  I seriously doubt I'd have ever been able to quit with out your app  It was absolutely indispensable in keeping me motivated and focused during the quitting process  So much so that I only ever recommend this app to friends and family who are trying to quit also  I always push the full version because the missions and extras are well worth the money  and you know  no one really accepts hugs dhc23    So cheers and thank you to both of you nootopianand dhc23  Thank you   Absolutely doesn't mean you can't do step one  And of course these are things you should discuss with your sponsor  What I described was simply my experience  Good luck   Congrats  that's awesome  Your body may have enjoyed it   I know I did  but that's subjective   I know weeds effect on me has become less pleasurable over the years   But I did love the dizziness   I loved the taste     I really wish cigs weren't bad for me  cause I'd go back in a second   Again  I'd being lying to myself if I said I didn't like them     That doesn't mean they won't kill me  along with all the other dozens of downsides   My downside   I'm a serial dater   I screwed up an engagement 12 years ago   So for the last ten years it has been one night stands and week month long relationships   Smelling like shit and tasting like shit  does not help that  I will not drink today  Yay  I'm so excited you're going to a meeting yourself  The best advice I can give is be a living example     When I've "told" someone what they should be doing   getting help  going to AA or therapy   it hasn't gone so well  When I do what I do with Al Anon  it's led to more of my friends asking what's it's about and what I'm learning  Which has lead to more meaningful conversations about life and how we live it in general  And my demonstrated commitment to working on myself has lead other friends to start working on themselves  too     Perhaps you could offer to go to an AA meeting with him  Or if you have a community recovery center  you could go there with him  It only costs your time and would probably be interesting for you to hear  The grapefruit cantaloupe is my everything  It is so good but they only sell it at the Whole Foods really far from my house   That's so sweet of you to offer  Unfortunately I don't play consoles  only on PC  And the only game I play is WoW lol  I've always hidden my addictions   I stored my kratom in an unlabeled cardboard box   I always made sure nobody saw me drinking it  and was super paranoid about having green powder residue all over my personal things   I didn't really realize I had a problem until I started taking too much and became very ill   I lied to everyone at work  lied to doctors  lied to my family   They all thought I had pneumonia or mono   I realized that kratom was ruining my life and I threw it all in the dumpster outside   So yeah basically I was like a secret agent in regards to my kratom intake   I'm never using it again  no matter how bad these withdrawls are  Ah to be free  you climbed the mountain and came back down to base  Now you can enjoy the rest of your years free from your enslavement  My first day too  Thanks for posting this  We can do this one craving at a time   That's a beautiful way to explain it     hi there   to reset your badge please click on the link in the sidebar  under   Badges         one day at a time worked really well for me in the beginning   otherwise I got totally overwhelmed and wanted to throw in the towel  sending you good thoughts  I won't drink with you today   I'm gonna start this for 2016    Thanks bro  Hey there  Your last paragraph is the same as what I did  I subscribed to SD two years ago and casually lurked as I was exploring my options  I would quit for about 30 days at a time just to "detox" and feel better  then pick up right where I left off  I finally decided to quit for good just two months ago because I realized there's no end game to this  Can I moderate myself  Yeah  I can  Will there be the random chance I get drunk when I didn't mean to  Yes  How often  Once a year  Once a month  Even if I go off the rails once a year  was it really worth it   I think the question you need to ask yourself is "what benefit does drinking provide me " Because  afterall  it's a choice we make  I think it's a good exercise to quit for a bit and just take a step back and look at everything going on about yourself and within your life  Not drinking WILL help you feel better  Will it solve all your problems  Hell no  There is no silver bullet in life  something that will magically solve our problems  But not drinking WILL provide you a clear mind to tackle those problems head on instead of putting them off   You don't have to tell people you are an alcoholic  You may not be  You have a problem though  you said it yourself  It may not be a huge problem  but it's a problem you can get rid of with patience and just staying away  You can still do your favorite hobby sober  even if you are used to drinking whenever you do it  Unless your hobby is a drinking contest  then that would be difficult   By the way  I still haven't told people I've stopped drinking for good  Not as an accountability issue  but just because I don't feel like it's necessary  Every time I go to my wife's house I'm offered a beer  I just say "no thanks"  No more questions are asked  The anxiety we generate from the pressure of not drinking is 100  internal  Even if someone presses for answers  they eventually stop  and that's the end of it   There you go  Talk to us once you reached 14 days or whenever you have the need to talk    looking forward to your posts  I really struggled with that also  which is why I tried and failed at moderation for 4 years before I finally gave up on the idea   I set a goal to not drink for 1 month initially  quickly extended it to 2  now it's a solid 3 even though I am leaning toward at least a year   Even now while I logically know I should quit forever  I entertain the idea of trying again after 1 or 2 years   I am less likely to do so the more I read about the experiences of others here who have tried it  but I don't think there's harm in letting myself think "maybe some day" when forever feels overwhelming  as long as I realize that day is not anytime soon   As sobriety becomes more of my norm over time  I suspect hope it will feel like less of a temptation  For me the decision is what makes my life happier  Drinking or not Drinking    I know what life is like drinking and I know what life is like not drinking  I get to choose which life I want  Woohoo  Day 4 here too and feeling great  I was crazy moody yesterday but so far so good today  We got this  Use the links to the right and find an Al Anon meeting tonight     No matter what happens remember that the sun will set tonight and the sun will rise again tomorrow  You are okay  This too shall pass    don't think of it as starting over  but as continuing your journey  Exactly this  Relapses are part of the journey to win any addiction  Keep up  I will be checking the post regularly to see how you're getting on    All the best thanks for the laugh and the apt metaphor  A   It only counts when you deliberately search for porn and then proceed to watch the video image  Putting it out there  just like you did  is what is really helping me quit  It's me being accountable  and truthful to myself  I'm only on day 4 but feeling GREAT  Hang in there  It's worth it   Thank you  I read online that a craving never lasts more than five minutes  but from the second I woke up this morning I have had an almost irresistible urge to not even vape  but to smoke an actual cigarette  which is a feeling I have not had in years   I'm very thankful to have found this subreddit  One urge at a time   Thanks for sharing  That little voice is a bugger  It never really goes away  but it certainly has faded on me  and it's much easier to say "no" now  It's hard at first but it definitely gets better  I will not drink today  mine changed quickly too  congrats   Im a ball of anxiety right now too only being a few weeks sober  and a pretty heavy drinker  I promise not to drink with you today  and take a lot of deep breathes instead  Stay focused my friend   There's a very simple action you've yet to try   getting yourself to an Al Anon meeting  It almost seems too simple  And that is simplistic  but people on here have already commented with some excellent thoughts  But don't say you've tried everything   when you haven't tried Al Anon yet  Good luck to you  I'm married into a very Irish American family and they are not big drinkers  but I became one anyway   I'm not Irish but my life situation was very much the same in terms of environment   Alcoholism and drinking cuts across all socio economic and ethnic barriers   And honestly I find the Irish stereotype rather overplayed   I work with a lot of British folks and I can say with all confidence that they have a heavy drinking and pub culture as well   When I wanted to stop and needed to stop I had to put all the excuses aside and start making serious and difficult changes   I'm surrounded by drinking because for decades that was my environment as well   It will take time to change that and make new friends and also recondition my family to the new  non drinking me   The greater distance I get from drinking  the less I miss it and the more value I'm getting out of life on almost every level   You have a great opportunity before you   Drinking will not reward you  but sobriety will   Not drinking with you today  I can't upvote this enough  Such a simple decision to make a higher quality life  That's because drinking has been your go to coping mechanic for the longest time  your brain wants to take the path of least resistance  the easiest way to solve a problem  I assume if your anything like me that solution was alcohol  You need to re train your brain to realise that exercise is a better solution that alcohol  It will take time but soon enough the gym will come naturally and alcohol will feel like the un natural choice  I know most of the advice is going to say how easy it is to quit at 16  Maybe it's true  maybe it's not  I was a desperate fiend for cigarettes at 16 if I couldn't score a couple of packs    More realistically  if you quit now your body will forget you ever smoked and it should have no effect on the rest of your life  I want you to think about what it will be like if you keep smoking  picture yourself turning 30  which is stupid young  and getting dizzy and coughing all the time while all of your peers are still running around playing football  Imagine turning 40 and having to stop and stand still every few steps to catch your breath on the way up a stair case  waking up every 20 minutes of the night out of breath and panicking  while your peers are outside throwing footballs with their kids  Then imagine turning 50 and not knowing it because you aren't here anymore  or maybe you will be here but now you're on oxygen and your quality of life is rated miserable    At 16 life seems forever  but it goes very quickly  If you put off the decision  you'll fall asleep and wake up 45 with all of these symptoms before you know it  You have to quit NOW  it sucks and you'll be uncomfortable and nobody will understand why  but you'll get through it  Quit now so you can be proud of the bullet you dodged  you'll be very glad you did when you see your smoking pals with bags under their eyes coughing and sitting out of every activity  Quitting sucks  you need to find the motivation to live through the 'suckiness' for a while  Day 3 and I'm feeling more confident that this was the right decision to make  Not drinking today   My home group meets tonight   thank goodness   1  That link is a serious trigger for many of us  please refrain from posting it without labelling as such   2  Not sure how this helps with our recovery  I was half expecting an insightful criticism of their claim  That wasn't the case  who cares  Have you looked into Smart Recovery  I don't know much about the program but it might be worth your while to see if there are meetings in your area  If not  then perhaps you could start up a group    I was right there with you until xmas  I hope you can find something fun to do  Being outside not at home in general helps me a lot  I have relapsed more times than I can remember  You hit the nail on the head  this substance is not fun anymore  This time I am going to make sobriety the new normal  I won't drink with you today   You can beat this urge  You don't want to be enslaved by smoking and it will not relieve any stressors in your life  Try to take pleasure is how your are beating this craving up   Damn shame  actively selling her body as a piece of meat  Glad i'm not her father  Everyone is free to do whatever they want with their body    All i'm saying is i would never associety myself with someone like that  Her subscribers consist of virgin teenager who want to copulate with her image on the internet  who cares  Also the next video on her channel is a suggestive one called "I GOT A BOOBJOB "   Welcome   Glad you found us here   If you're looking for help and change  you've come to the right place   Please look through the "New  Start here" and "Community support" sections on the right side of this webpage   What I needed when I was new was to stop gaming completely  at least for a while  so that I could get the sleep I needed  find some sanity and clear thinking  and get my head screwed on straight   Here's what I suggest   1  make it your top  1 priority to not game from now until the end of the day  and keep it that simple  2  don't game  no matter what  no games of any type  no gaming videos  3  when urges to game hit  talk to others   talk to people here  talk to people in the  CGAA meetings  http   cgaa info online meetings    talk to friends or family who support you in healthy choices  4  Connect with other people who have successfully stopped gaming long term and turned their lives around in ways you'll like to emulate   Find out what worked for them and try those things yourself   5  Accept support   This is very hard and very important   Support is available here   You deserve it   It will make the difference in whether or not you continue further down the path you're on or you pull out of it and discover new ways of living  I'm with you guys   High mental capacity guy  witty  quick thinking   Great job  make plenty of    for decent lifestyle  middle class   family  kids  cars paid off   I never realized my mind had such power  until the weed   I vape all day for "chronic" pain I'd rather have now  then be at less than full potential   We can all be successful  but realize we need more   I have known that for a while  so I'm back at Leaves  Providers of such potent material  whether it's fast food or porn  should be held more accountable with how that affects society and our behaviour  With it being so accessible  there needs to also be measures brought in so that underage individuals aren't exposed to it  We can do this  relatively  well with things like tobacco and drugs  So I believe this isn't about free speech as such  but being able to understand the potential of porn as being a negative part of someone's life  Vacation is really tempting  All that free time  you can do whatever you want  your brain is set to 'have fun and chill out mode'  and then it comes to you "Man  you're on vacation  It's time to have fun  Why not gaming a little to reward yourself for all that time without gaming " Be prepared in advance for that kind of excuse from your brain  Also  don't get disencouraged by the relapse  Relapses are part of the journey to win any addiction  Just keep on  harder this time  Thanks i found the link thank you  I'm thankful for all the great people in my life and  this subreddit  I just hope I can get back to me     Thanks    good wishes to you as well This sounds a lot like me  I didn't think my then partner knew I was drinking  I'd wait until he had a few beers to get my weird on  but it eventually all came crashing down  Falling asleep in the middle of the afternoon  making eggs wrong and then continuing making eggs until I cried  all super wack behavior  The last was driving to to store to get pasta while buzzed  neither of us even like pasta but I had to have it   and crashing into his parking structure  In front of him  Thank god I didn't hurt anyone    It takes what it takes  and so often  it doesn't take enough until it does    I wish you success today and moving forward  I will not drink with you today   I started writing a novel on this  it feels like writing a diary but at least I can detach myself from it  Get up and walk  Make that a habit before the idea of getting up and walking causes discomfort  possible if anxiety gets out of control     There's nothing you can do to completely stop that crazy feeling in your head  I don't care what anybody says  it's not just "mental"  There is a clear and obvious symptom of low dopamine that cues a craving  It's as if somebody took a vacuum to your consciousness and you transform into this state of 'need'  Turning into a werewolf on a full moon is a funny but good way to explain it  The best advice I can give is to learn to distinguish it properly  you don't desire a cigarette  you desire your brain to return to it's 'normal' chemical balance that you would get with a cigarette  After a few weeks this feeling will stop being chronic and just hit in waves  fewer and farther between as the months roll by    This is where exercise comes in  you need to seek out activities that will hit your brain's reward center  This is also why some quitters turn into sugar junkies  there are also major changes in blood sugar when quitting   and of course why we relapse   Accept that you don't feel 100   exercise and laugh so you can feel 80   slowly but surely your brain will find it's new homeostasis and you'll feel like yourself again  with more energy and less cough and stink    Good luck friend  One great thing to take is that when we identify the weakest points we can then be more aware of the time we need to be on guard and have a plan of action to help us stay strong   For me it was idle time at nights  Being online and bored  So knowing that allowed me to counter it Also  search online to see if there's any psychological specialists in your area  I was really surprised when I found mine and the treatment with her is really helping   I'm not sure  but it really doesn't seem like it should be  4g is nothing  That was one normal dose for me  and I was dosing maybe 5 6 times a day  I bet you'll feel fine after one day of cold turkey  I think you had more to say here and Reddit cut you off    haha I would love to hear the rest  Two days as well  I'm with you man  Work through it    I will look into it  I have heard of it  but I have never been  Thay worry   dread and anxiety of no sex for a week is crippling you   While you are on the right path as soon as you can mentally let go of that anxiety and worry over nonsex for a week then you will be fine   That is helping cause the desire to act out with porn    But you are on the path  And thats great  Good luck  And remember the mental fight will be tough  But you can win it  Its your mind  Own it The temptation is real  Definitely have the urge to distract myself so bad while working  It feels great to liberate myself from video games though  I am starting to feel excited about my other passions now   Checking in  still going strong  Stay encouraged brothers    1 for something artistic manual  The exhaustion helps with sleeping while it provides a way to express things that correctly go out when you sleep  I have not  and will not drink today  Everyone is downstairs drinking wine  I'm going to join them with a nice cup of tea  Nitpick  chamomile is herbal tea  Definitely helps with sweet sleep  I enjoyed cigarettes like I enjoyed the company of the hot  psycho chick I dated years ago   I'm glad both relationships are over   Yes   Quitter's Flu  http   www whitecloudelectroniccigarettes com blog quitting tobacco smokers flu   is very common  Both the first time I attempted to quit and this most recent  and successful  attempt I got sick    Basically  as it states in the article I linked to  "The lungs contain small hair like structures called cilia  These cilia  naturally sweep particles out of the wind pipe to be expelled by coughing  Tobacco smoke coats the lungs with tar and disrupts this process by preventing the cilia from working  When you quit smoking  the tar begins to break down and the cilia once again start cleaning "  Congrats on 3 weeks smoke free  you should start feeling better soon  You are not alone in this   I hope you learn to forgive "drunk you "  And I hope you learn to love your sober self   Cobgratations on day two  and on having this sort of self awareness at 22    I tried it  It caused mental gymnastics   When I control it I don't enjoy it and when I enjoy it I don't control it    Went to a discussion meeting this afternoon  It was pretty good  I shared about Friday and the hippie party and how I felt afterward and how I should be grateful instead of whiny  Now I'm at work sitting in the back waiting to clock in because some guy at the meeting was nice enough to give me a ride and now I am here forty minutes early   I'm hoping this gets implemented and then everyone can start this Damn VBC  61 inches   You wear that thing like a feather boa  I can moderate my drinking until the first one  "Sober me is a ball of anxiety who is often in a bad mood "  I bet you that is actually hungover you  I thought that was sober me too    Turns out sober me is pretty awesome and able to handle the pressures of life MUCH better than drunk or hungover me  Wishing you luck in stopping  You are young  and you are making a great decision  I wish I had stopped at 22 instead of 26  Thank you  It's been a challenge  You hit a low  but the only way is up  Well done for admitting what's happened as soon as possible   you're already on your way to getting back to where you were before  It'd be worth considering what's happened  and how to avoid it again  but then taking that anxiety and using it for something positive  We're all here for you  Keep going  Absolutely  The first few weeks of my quit I couldn't wait for gym night to run it out   I felt that cardio gave me a similar sensation   Going for an early check in  Urges have been there  but I've started to use an addiction recovery app  and this has helped a lot today  Currently climbing out of one of my lowest moments  so I'm taking it a day at a time   Was expecting penis for some reason  Keep your chin up  This time will be so much easier on you  ONLY eight and a half months    Well bloody done  I know it does get easier  and that being sober can become the norm    but been a long time since that was the case  so onwards  one day at a time  x One day at a time   that's how I'm taking it  Make tomorrow's you proud  I won't drink with you  I might be waayyyy off  I guess it depends on whether it's level or heaping  too  I bet you could balance almost 2tsp in one spoonful if you were determined lol  I used to have a mg scale that I used for other substances but got rid of it     Thanks for the support  I definitely feel stalled where I am though  I'm at 4 gm a day and I've felt aweful for days  My habit was years long though  and I tend to become dependent quickly  So I expect a lot of discomfort  Maybe expecting to feel bad constantly is making it worse  I hope BSO helps when I quit because I do NOT want to feel aweful at Disneyland with my wife and kids in about a week  and I really don't want to have to sneak more of this sh t around  Good gawd I'm just ready to be done  Same here  Like over the past few days following christmas I was able to eat normal  But now I'm just back to my normal binging and purging restricting     I tried it   about 1000 times  Didn't work   A little tip  spend 20 seconds writing down 5 things you are grateful for daily  help you see how great you have it or just name one for each finger   That's correct  Did you change usernames  If you did you should PM me the old one or your name  I can't recall a C at the moment but I'm sure I remember you I'm right here with you  This sub is amazing for the support and loving you need when you can't find it anywhere else   I'm really proud of you  Thanks for this  I'm definitely going to evaluate at the end of the three months  Maybe before then I'll decide on giving it up for good  I am not definitely saying I'll go back to it    but yeah just as of yet not ready to really face "forever"     You can still do your favorite hobby sober  even if you are used to drinking whenever you do it  Unless your hobby is a drinking contest  then that would be difficult   This made me laugh  Thankfully the hobby does not involve drinking and doesn't have an inherent association to alcohol for me  Additionally  the community  while there are certainly plenty of drinkers  is pretty accepting of any personal choices people make and people don't ask a lot of questions  It's really been wanting to improve at this hobby that has finally pushed me to try quitting     I'd def recommend getting a scale  It will help you taper in a big way  Also  I'm sure you're aware by now how much different batches of even the same strain can vary in potency  If you go the long taper route  expect some ebb and flow of symptoms  even at a consistent dose  No  If you closed it without watching you should not reset   I just chalk it up to a drunk disagreement  Who's right  Who cares  That drama doesn't warrant a post discussing it Thank you  Wish you good luck too brother  stay strong I hear you on the love to have better useful addictions  Well done holding out  I remembering being kinda shocked at one urge I got  I'd have almost fought anyone to get my fix  gave away laptop so had to drive to parents to act out  that helped  I'd have time to think on the journey  get out of the house  I was shocked with how up and down I was too  but would think I going mad until I'd laugh and remember  "oh yeah  withdrawals from 20   year addiction" and I'd get on with my day    A drink can feel like a friend because there are many similarities  It can give you comfort  it can give you warmth  it can make you feel like you're not totally alone  But none of these things last  and none of these feelings are truly real  only an illusion of those feelings   I feel like I've given up my whole life  I can't imagine a life without a drink at the moment because it feels like it's been part of me for so long  But look around this forum  so many people telling us that the good is yet to come  that sobriety is going to be so much more fulfilling than the temporary numbness which a drink gives you   I will not drink with you today  Stick with it buddy  we're all here for one another  This is also me  although I'm female  so the number are 1 2 drinks lower in general   It has been an interesting journey doing moderation management  and it helps to hear from others who have had similar experiences  Thanks for sharing  You're taking on a lot of guilt  but it sounds like everyone in this situation is playing their own part  GF doesn't seem ready to make a change  based on the bitching  And I wonder  is GF's mom trying to force solutions and getting frustrated when her lack of control is inevitably revealed    Phone session sounds like a good idea  And I'm glad you've got your home group tonight  Thank you  I barely got through it   Slaps fins like a happy dolphin  That makes a lot of sense  Head shop 00's said  6g on the package now that I think back   I used to stuff them as tight as possible and dab a bit of water at the seal to weld them so they wouldn't open in my pocket  I didn't want to spend money on caps because I was spending so much on Kratom  Ugh   Thank you for posting  ever bit of support is what is keeping me going right now   I didn't beleive I was alcoholic enough for AA  like in my mind because I didn't drink in the morning that was my definition of an alcoholic  Then when I would start to drink in the morning I changed the goalposts to the fact I didn't drink every morning  or I didn't drink spirits every single day  basically any excuse I could find to lie to myself   This sub is such a support and I will most definitely be going to AA tomorrow  as that will be a challenge for me  Im so glad things better for you  and thanks again  Thanks  And you are right about the support and loving that this sub provides  I seem to recall some time ago that it was voted the most supportive sub on reddit  I can see why  It is brilliant  So glad I found it  Enjoy the rest of your day FTC  xx Slaps fins like a happy dolphin  I did this many times  always worked for about a month then back to my old ways of tying one on every time i drank  I felt when I focused on moderation I craved alcohol more than when I just don't pick up the first drink  Mind games  Excellent  If you've got a hr monitor  you can even watch your heart rate go down after four days no drinking  For me  from a steady 100 90  80 resting  to 70  60 resting   That's what I did   netflix marathon  I was watching "Shameless"   about an alcoholic father    I reset my badge as well and I'm not drinking with you today   how many times do i remember    Awesome  Yeah  it's ridiculous how long it takes  I have tried to cut too much  and then ended up so stressed and anxious I've lost progress and cheated  As long as your total next week is less than your total this week  I consider it a win  I hate the lemon and coconut but love the grapefruit    or pamplemeuse    or however it's spelled  The lime is also acceptable  I have had a few moments like that one  Both kids and all of their  friends knew that in a pinch  I would drive them home  no questions asked    The post bender anxiety is painful  scary and pretty paralyzing   But it's not you   it's a temporary state   It will pass  Moderation has never worked for me  I can't wait for that happy bank account  Also  thanks for giving me something to look forward to  I can't wait to spoil my family next Christmas  I was great at moderation until I had the first drink   At that point  all thoughts of drinking moderately went out the window   There were times when I stopped before having  too  many drinks or blacking out  but I don't really recall feeling in control of that whole process  The good thing about new users is that we can tell our stories again   at least       Try do it for you too mate   Thank you for asking how you can help   I've been through medical detox a few times   The time I managed to get and stay clean after was when they didn't make it a horrible experience   Please don't withhold all medication   Especially when my anxiety is so bad I'm having panic attacks and haven't slept in 3 days   Of course there is a line between just giving someone everything they want and making it tolerable comfortable   I feel like doctors think "if we make this completely horrible it won't happen again" but that just isn't true     Talk to your patients   Try and be understanding   Don't treat us like we are a waste or a burden on your time   I've had a nurse tell me "I have to help you instead of my patients with real issues"   Don't do that   Addiction is a difficult  difficult thing to deal with   Be patient and kind   If you can't give medication  what can you do for someone who's freaking out   A walk  A hot shower   A breathing treatment     I also deal with chronic illness so I've spent a good amount of time hospitalized  and usually alone   A kind and caring nurse makes a HUGE difference     Thank you for all that you do   On day three  high five and ditto  Call me crazy  but I think you're onto something    For a short term user it probably won't be as bad  I'm struggling with it but I'm coming off a much larger addiction   Stay positive  I think that quitting now is going to save you a lot of grief  I wish I'd had the insight to be asking that question when I was only a few months in  I am 29  At 22 I sounded EXACTLY like you  I knew I had a problem but unfortunately did not quit at that time  Oh how I wish I did  I was never ever able to drink moderately no matter how many times I told myself I could  The fact that I was so young made it so much worse for me  I hated that all of my friends could handle a night of drinking yet I would black out every single time  Well 6 years later  I lost those friends  lost jobs and homes  had countless embarrassing moments  burned a whole lot of bridges and put myself into very dangerous situations  You are so strong and trust me you are 100  making the right decision  Don't let your story be like mine when you're 29  One day at a time  you can do this girl  I'm sober with you today  Out of all the people on this planet  someone most definitely cares about you  They just have to find you  And they can't if you're dead  Please go to the E R    get that taken care of   And out of all the subreddits I could have "randomly" clicked on  I clicked on this one  So  please   don't let yourself go    Oh my gosh  I didn't even realize  Thanks  Clown  also 22  also on day 2  feeling in the same boat as well  my past 5 years have been constant binge drinking  remorse  guilt  thinking "its fine because im young  everyone drinks heavily in college  etc" but knowing deep down that my addiction wasnt circumstantial and i wouldnt "grow out of it"  all of my regrets come from living in a haze of alcohol  hangover  drugs to drink "better" etc  not today satan  i would rather stay in bed and feel boring and introverted for a while than push myself to extremes to feel comfortable socially and wake up feeling worthless and guilty instead  glad to have some young buddies not to drink with today    I will add that I'm a previous heroin addict  I had 4 5 years of abstinence from absolutely everything before I started dabbling in kratom   I agree with you  I was a social drinker but didn't like the affects of even a single drink  I'm way into fitness and having a healthy body   mind to drink  I cut it out completely in July 2016  Funnily though  a couple of people just assume that I was an addict and that's why I quit  Not that I care  but to your point  people think you only cut out alcohol because you have a problem   nice work   and it's not a relapse until the booze has been drunk   we all have a few "close calls" under our belts  im sure  I will not drink today  Got other things to do  Blood pressure to maintain  A heart to keep on a level beat  Languages to learn  Curiosities that I've been blinded to  No time to drink  No matter what garbage I have to sort through   it's always worth that rare  amazing story    Thanks for the replies   Again  this community has really brought me hope  for the first time in a long time   I've been doing plenty of research on getting clean  but I often find it difficult to find specific information  It seems like there's so many different answers to so many different situations   which is why I went this route  I was hoping to get some help from people who have a similar situation   instead of general answers  if that makes sense    About Kratom  does it just continue the addiction  What I mean is  will it be different tapering with Kratom as opposed to the opiates  I'm assuming  I don't know  if I took some benzos to help with WDs  I wouldn't get full blown addicted after taking them for a week  therefore it will make it "easier" to stop taking those  With Kratom  am I just replacing opiates  So   if I stop taking Kratom after a week  would it be the same as jumping off opiates cold turkey  I hope my question makes sense  I'm having trouble explaining it   As far as my job is concerned  you're right  I realize if I keep this up  I'll lose more than my job and it won't matter anyway  I really wanna try to keep it and get clean  I know it's gonna be hard  but I really have to try  My company does offer various mental health services   but I'd still have to let my boss know why I'd be away for 30 days   and I really don't want it getting out that I'm an addict  My boss tell everybody everything   I also agree I have to be able to say these things out loud  I called a couple places yesterday to set up an appointment  but they were closed  I'm gonna try again today    I've also been through this a bit with subs  After not sleeping for seven days  I finally called for help  The place I went was OK  but I didn't give it my all  I also feel like they didn't do a good job helping me  It felt like the one on ones were also general answers to general problems  The answers my counselor was giving me were all answers I've heard before  That's also hard for me to explain  I have plenty of issues   I've had a few things happen in my life  in addiction to what I already mentioned  that I never felt comfortable talking about  I try and block out that it even happened  sometimes it feels like it happened in a dream  and if I say it out loud  it'll make it real  The drugs helped keep it buried for a while   but of course  it came back   with an entire set of new problems    The psychiatrist was even less involved  She just prescribed Wellbutrin and Klonopin and sent me on my way  The Klonopin was a miracle drug though   I got my first multiple hour night's sleep on it  But  after that  I couldn't sleep without it  I also had a seizure   I think  I was lying on the couch and nodded off  next thing I knew I was shaking all around  My girlfriend was sitting next to me  she was so great back then  she would run my legs and wait on my every need  and she said it looked like I had a seizure  I'm still unsure whether it really was   Ugh   here I go rambling again  And I realize I'm making excuses  It really is time to man up  I always read that people should always call a doctor first  so that makes me wonder whether people could die if they jump cold turkey  Whenever my heart is racing like crazy at night  it feels like I'm gonna die   and that's why I'm worried about going cold turkey again    Again   thanks for the replies  I know people have better things to do than sit on Reddit and listen to some strangers problems  I'm sure most people have problems of their own   No  you don't have to reset and you don't have to break contact with your friend either  just explain to him that you're serious about this  Thanks a lot of for sharing  I see a lot of myself in what you have written  and as you said this community is really helpful for those of us trying to kick this thing    I've never heard this comparison to other serious addictions and its pretty shocking really what you are saying  The sad thing is gaming is not viewed as an addiction by 99  of people and so the industry marches on unopposed by anyone and it keeps getting worse for each generation   Yes  I felt depressed suicidal throughout the first bit of sobriety  but I feel better now than I ever have before  My apartment is fucking clean   When I was smoking I would literally leave dishes around for weeks and sometimes months  I care more about my lifestyle  hygiene  cleanliness  etc now    I care about waking up on time now  eating healthier  working out    I care about myself  and I'm not constantly in a depressive fog  It's weird to realize how little I cared about my life and lifestyle when I was high   My last night of drinking I was jogging home from the bar  drunk out of my mind  when I fell and landed on my hand   I ended up with a huge abrasion on one palm and the realization that I could very well have broken my wrist   That realization made me decide that enough was enough and that I had to stop  even if that didn't seem entirely possible   I decided to initially stop for three months too   Within the first month I discovered this community and got a badge to mark my progress and hold me accountable   I read posts every day to remind myself why I stopped and chime in when I think I have something relevant to add   It's made all the difference  Without failed moderation attempts  I wouldn't be sober today   My inability to moderate is one of the primary ways I describe my alcoholism   If you drink like a gentleman lady  my hat is off to you  Not really    I can relate to this  I denied having a "problem" for a long time because I wasn't a textbook alcoholic who drinks all day every day  But for me  it was every night  I would regularly tell myself I'd have just one beer with dinner  but I'd get excited and open my beer while cooking  I'd finish it by the time dinner was ready  and open another to have with dinner  And by that time  I wasn't even that hungry for the food I'd prepared because of the heavy beer I was drinking  and I'd really prefer to just not eat so I could keep drinking  Stopping at two  strong  beers was a good night  I wouldn't focus on conversation between me and boyfriend because of my buzz  At times  I felt like we were having some profound discussion  but in retrospect  it was just me drunk rambling and him patiently listening   He's not much of a drinker    normally one drink per night   If we put on a movie  I wouldn't pay full attention because my mind would wander  and I'd be considering whether I should get another drink  paying attention to how much my bf or friends were drinking so I could try not to seem too excessive by comparison  etc   Today  on Day 3 without booze  I woke up at 5 45am to go running  take a shower  and make breakfast before work  none of which I would have done if I had drank last night  I'm not necessarily saying I'll be doing this every single morning  but it was a great way to start the day  I also was having regular relationship problems for a while  My bf would say something that annoyed me  and I'd shut down and reach for another drink or overreact  Sober  I feel much more in control of my reactions and aware of what's actually going on  not just my drunken interpretation  My relationship feels stronger and it's only been a few days   Thanks for sharing    great post  POST REMOVED  Hi there  this sub is really about  QUITTING kratom and not moderate use  violation of rule  4 in the side bar  staying on topic    No offense  but this is probably a better question for a sub that is all about using kratom   good luck   You too  Another great reason to stop drinking  Vitamin S for me   sugar   Seriously  it killed a lot of the cravings   Not drinking today  Kiwi watermelon is my favorite   Weird   I will have to try that  Good excuse to have some vitamin S      Kudos on 2 years    Feels great  don't it  I was listening to a recovery podcast on this topic about a year ago  and the host says something along the lines of   If you are honest with yourself  everything you have done until now  has been your attempt at moderation    Hmmmm   I thought    Then a few weeks ago I read Understanding the Functional Alcoholic  and in that book says something like   Only alcoholics would be obsessed with returning to moderate drinking   if a normal drinker had to stop drinking because it was giving them  for example  health problems  they would just quit and move on    Touche     I don't exactly understand the biochemistry   but the more I'm learning about alcohol and addiction  I'm beginning to understand that there is a biochemical change that takes place that makes alcoholism progressive   which is why even after weeks  months  years dry a return to drinking leaves an alcoholic exactly where they left off when they had stopped previously      I think the bigger question is though   Is it worth the risk   For me   the pleasure of a glass of wine is pretty fleeting  the costs have been pretty high  and will likely only get higher   Hi everyone  I'm not drinking today  If I could drink moderately  I'd do it all day every day  Get rid of the bong  If you don't want to throw it out you could gift it to a friend    I'm on day 3  cold turkey  It is definitely hard  You got this  just take it one day at a time  that's what I've been telling myself   My weakest point is in the evening   Coming on here and posting helps  you're already helping   I had them for about a month   Now I still have vivid dreams but they've settled down   Was a daily smoker for 20 years yes hahahaha I had many other negative reactions to alcohol  P I just find it interesting how many little things improved once I removed alcohol   Last year  I tried so many different laundry detergents  lotions  body wash  etc   wondering  "what could be doing this to my skin  "  Maybe the poison I was drinking  duh  What kind of Suzuki you got  I will not drink today   Waiting on a call regarding the address of my first ever AA meeting     Right there with you   Nice work  Melatonin makes them even weirder  man  I had like 5 different dreams last night first night off of smoking and all the senses feel so real  I'm surprised you're having any symptoms whatsoever actually  I would just stop completely right now  You're probably at the peak of how bad you're going to feel  Should be better tomorrow  May get a little irritable and lower mood and motivation for 2 3 days  then you'll be back to normal I'd say  I was up to 40g for a few months and Ive tapered down to 12g and barely had any physical symptoms at all  You'll be good very soon  stop while you're ahead   I was sitting at a bar recently in St  Maarten on vacation   There were three people sitting next to me chatting away   having a grand old time   whooping it up   My reaction was   I remember getting drunk at 13 00 hours   Then   I was evesdropping   they mentioned that it has been 30 days since they went dry   I looked over and they were drinking sparking water   I never would have guessed that these people at a bar having fun were sober   but it was true   My point is   you can go out for a craic with the mates   and be sober too   Might even be interesting  From about 10pm till 2 I used to watch it  That's usually when I get bored and thoughts start creeping in  For some reason I never went to bed early when I didn't have to  even if I was bored and tired  Im trying to build the habbit of going to bed earlier to avoid any urges that sneak in in those hours    Cheers   Break the chain   I've tried a dozen different ways  I'd construct these crazy elaborate rules to try and corral my drinking to an orderly slow moving stream  I'd only drink on the weekends  Or I'd never drink hard liquor  Or I'd only drink wine  I'd only drink when my much more responsible and normal boyfriend drank  though  weighing much less than him  drinking only as much as he does is still too much usually but nevermind  all of these things in an attempt  to be a normal drinker by ACTING like a normal drinker      But that's not gonna fucking work because that's not addressing WHY I'm  not  a normal drinker  And until I do that  and I've a suspicion there is no reason  And I'm okay with that  then all the rules in the world won't help because too much of me doesn't want it to  Waving a stick and saying it's a wand doesn't make you a wizard  It just doesn't      I hope this helps  I don't want to tell you how to be or what will or won't work for you  I'm just sharing my experience  Best advice I can give is to analyze the why and not just the what   Hey   It's entirely okay to be selfish about sobriety   And  a fair warning  Alcohol is cunning  When were doing our best  when we don't think about it so much  is when we're at risk  Complacency can lead to thoughts of  "I can handle one drink " Don't let that happen  I had to become aware of what I call my "addictive alcoholic voice"  It is essentially those though processes that lead to drinking  When I learned what to sounded like  I was able to recognize it and  for the most part  shut it down    But sobriety is also about having the strength to ask for help before you take a drink  just in case you can't shut that voice down    I'm really proud that you're at 50 days  Keep it up     Congrats on 50 days   In my multiple attempts to get sober I found I'd often relapse after a decent length of sobriety   The alcoholic brain is sneaky and can plant seeds just when you feel like you've made progress    So stay mindful and let's celebrate another day of sobriety   Not Today   Congratulations  I was a smoker for 20 years  Staying smoke free gets easier and easier  Each time you say "no" you get better at it  Be super nice to yourself right now  make not smoking your top priority  I just hit my 5 month mark on New Year's Eve and it feels great  Best thing I ever did  Stay strong  I know I need to get rid of the bong  It's not even a nice bong or anything  yet it's so hard to throw away  It's almost like if I throw it out that's it  the actual end   And I have this nagging fear that the person I think I am when I'm clean is not who I think I am  I have this perfect image of myself before I smoked weed bring super productive and social and everything  and what if when I quit it turns out that I'm just as lazy and useless as I am when I'm perma high   Perhaps it isn't realistic to think this  but it is a fear    Damn ego's    It seems that way at first but from a persons opinion that has shorter term sobriety  I promise I've already realized how much more there is to gain then "what I lost"   m  I have an online counselor too   I find it super helpful  but it took me about 3 6 months to really see some progress   During that time I greatly reduced my drinking  and then eventually quit   Have you checked out Smart Recovery or Refuge Recovery   they both have online phone meetings every day    Welcome   61 inches and  growing    It starts as my belt and it winds up me all serpentine until it's full boa   Thanks  Try to eat lots of veggies and fruits  Exercise daily  Maybe take a hot bath and sauna followed by a cold shower  Meditate  Just try to eat very healthy now  Lots of lean protein  fruits veggies  grains  yogurt  nuts and seeds  green tea  Idk much about hyperthyroidism  perhaps do some Google research about supplements or see your doctor This is the best New Years post that I've seen anywhere yet   I wonder how I missed this   Must have been that little binge this weekend   Happy New Year fucker   Glad you're doing better  congrats to you too  Congrats on what you've done so far  the 3 months and the clarity and resolve your post shows     Loneliness can be a frequent feeling for me too  I'm not naturally a social person but the steep drop in friends after starting recovery was hard for me to ignore  Here's to hoping both of us find peace in being alone  I really like that feeling when I find it     Not drinking with you today  Thank you for sharing and good luck with your job search   Smoking destroys the cilia in your lungs  When you quit  they begin to grow back  The cilia create the motility necessary to remove mucus  dirt  and tar that have built up in your lungs  As your lungs continue to regenerate  your cough may get worse as they become more capable of removing what has built up  It's terrible  I know   I probably spent even more on that in the last year I was drinking every day   Gross     Where will your first trip be    I've been smoking for about 20yrs  with a few breaks as well   I don't think there is any permanent damage  your body will heal with time  I think the mental part will be the hardest to heal from   I'm only on day 3 so I don't have a lot of advice  What has been working for me is changing my routine  I used to go outside through our garage but that's were I smoked so now I am using the backdoor  Also when I get a craving I have been talking myself through it  When that's not enough I come to this sub and read the posts  There is usually one or two points someone makes that make me remember why I am doing this     Wishing you all the best with grad school  that is definitely something to focus on  hope it helps  I can relate to this on so many levels  Kudos on your decision to stop now  Good idea   They do check my heart rate whenever I go in so I'll start paying attention to that too   I got deferred for a week because my heart rate was 105  even after just sitting in the waiting room for ten minutes  lost  70 thanks to that  I actually just found smart recovery   I signed up just this morning    I like the program as I'm not religious at all and am very science minded   I already started utilizing some of the online tools and found an in person meeting close by later this week  Took me a while to realise how fabulous sober me is   You will love sober you too   Be kind to yourself   I won't drink with you today  This is amazing   Poppers  like   the liquid or mixing tobacco   weed  Fucking hilarious  I have some errands to run but I plan to do a little day drinking after I take care of business  I think I need to draw this after a couple drinks   This hits home with me  Yeah  getting through day one  then two  then three    a week    great  But then what  I've failed so many times because of losing sight of what really matters     Being sober today  and being sober yesterday    which helps me to be sober today     It is so very hard  x First  I can really relate to your story  as I recently have completely shifted careers at the age of 37     What kind of support do you have   Would you consider a therapist  I have an online one  or attending meetings    Drink today I will not  Exactly that    Love you doll   How's sobriety treating you  30  days now  still going strong  thanks for the support   Nice  I really like the UK phone online meetings over the US ones   Check them out      I think this is very important to realize  A slip is a slip  It's something you learn from but it certainly does not cancel out ANYTHING you've accomplished in your sober time   AA helped me quit and stay quit  I know they'll be willing to share the solution with you  hit a meeting or 90  See what it's all about  Fair enough  If I had your body I'd maintain it to but thankfully in order to maintain my potato body all I have to do is drink and eat everything  It disgusts me too    But it more disgusts me that I crave it  Congrats you on a star  Same  I will not drink with you today  We will hit our next milestone soon taking it one day at a time  Temptation will fade over time so hang in there  Hello Spitfirelance  Welcome to SD  Here you will find many friends and much support  Pull up a chair  Let's grab a coffee  eh  A badge is also a good idea  xx FOCUS is a great one  Wish you the best in 2017  Being Serious is a great one  Here's to a great 2017   Sign me up please  They say  there is no one to stupid to be helped by the program of AA but we bury the "to smart" ones all the time   Rock bottom is a six foot deep hole in the cemetery  Hope you don't wait for rock bottom    Your bottom is only the point where you decide to stop digging  Seriously  Some of us don't believe these bullshit platitudes for a reason  they're a farce and don't stand up to inspection by the inquiring mind  I had a friend commit suicide about two or three months ago  It has definitely been a trigger a few times when I've dosed heavier  like visiting his widow   Just keep it up  man  There are always going to be triggers to use  When I have a stressful day with my kids or my wife spends a bunch of money on credit I'm so tempted to cheat  I have caved a few times  and I can tell you  I only feel worse  I feel guilty about messing up my progress  then I feel more WD for a few days when I force myself back on track   I feel SO stuck at 4 gm  I typically take 2 gm around 11am and 2 gm around 3 4 pm and am in WD all morning and somewhat less so in the evenings  Anyways  Just want to say I am feeling that same tug of war in my head  all day  Keep on it  I'm hoping that these "walls" have to break eventually  I'm trying Black Seed Oil to go from 4 to 2 grams a day  Really  really hoping it helps  I have access to clonidine from a sympathetic Dr  friend but I really don't want to add another drug to mess of neurons  Maybe I'll have to in the end  Cant you get like a consent to have sex with other woman  I mean  I would let my SO have other man if I had that painful condition  Running  walking  sleeping  generally everything is better because its gone lol That's the plan   Thank you very much   Today has been a lot better     Think of all the time you've lost to alcohol  F that  Get your life back  It's yours  Not alcohols   I won't drink with ya today   A hot bath before bed with epsom salt   Spinning on a stationary bike until my legs are exhausted like 30 minutes before my bedtime routine   I've heard magnesium helps  Bahahaha   not sure I want to relive some of those  Yes my sentiment exactly except I read the sidebar sort of drunkenly but my first post was about kindling because I was seriously fucked up at that time yay me and they were like you're fucked you're gonna die you have kindling read the fucking sidebar YOURE GONNA DIE and I was like FUUUUUCK that was a long time ago under an old name  Ah  memories  This was great to read  after a weekend of people questioning my decision to stop and looking at me like I was a hypochondriac with three heads when I said I was an alcoholic this was comforting to read   Yes   I never had a DUI  lost a job  lost a relationship  or wrecked my life   But I was also not a present mom  was constantly planning when I could get drunk again and had no interest in drinking one glass  or bottle  of wine   Great self reflections  I won't drink with you today  Congratulations    I'd love to know if you've done anything else  apart from quitting drinking  to lose so much weight so quickly  Could use some pointers lol One of the diagnostic criteria for this is actually resolution of symptoms after abo  5 weeks of abstaining from cannabis  If your stomach issues are continuing to get worse after quitting  please see a doctor as there are a huge number of medical issues that can be causing your stomach issues that should probably be checked out if your symptoms aren't receding  I highly suggest the Recovery Elevator podcast    Lmao   I love to cook and try new recipes and come up with healthy options to old favorites   I used to be quite round   Don't want that again   Feeling a little pudgy after the holiday indulgences   But I enjoyed the fuck out of myself so it was worth it  I mean you don't have to like me  Man some of you all here are a bit too serious   You can go to an "open" meeting of AA without identifying  You can call your local AA anonymously and ask any   you have  They will also be able to direct you to an " open " meeting   " The ONLY requirement for AA is a DESIRE to stop drinking"  Going further   you can go to an " open" meeting even if your not sure you want to stop  I won't drink with you today  But   but    yeah   you're right   Does anybody happen to know the half life realistically  I feel pretty decent  Took 2 yesterday  One this morning  I really don't need to seizure out again  it's reported as 5 30 hours      I can handle a little anxiety but I have no desire to be face down bleeding from my tongue again  I had nightmares early on too about 3 4 weeks after quitting  I hope they get better for you  The good news is that nightmares are associated with high intelligence  so there's that  Try to take care of yourself and minimize stress  and maybe change up your eating and drinking habits before bed  I noticed that when I ate cheese anywhere between two hours before bedtime  my dreams are extra vivid and awful   I have a friend who has awful nightmares when she takes Valerian root  You never know what could be a trigger for you  Seventeen days is awesome   Stay strong  No one is going to make you do anything  If you just want to observe  consider going to an open meeting  Good luck  I've been in that position  The trust and security aspect is hard to get back  I won't drink with you today though   Moderation doesn't work for me   Had them for about 3 months when I quit  They were explicitly the worst aspect of quitting for me  Losing the restful sleep at night diminished the classic positive effects of quitting which rrally discouraged me early  but when the dreams subsided I had a much easier go So far   it sucks  My ADHD is preventing me from being productive despite being sober   and being sober is preventing me from sleeping until there is something worth doing   It's kind of a shit feeling    Brilliant  Well done you  You inspire us  Thank you for posting  xx I can't believe no ones said passionfruit yet   That's my go to     What you call yourself doesn't matter  Ik an alcoholic but it took me a bit to actually admit that to myself    So whether you're an alcoholic  problem drinker  or a Drunky McDrunkface  it doesn't matter All you need to go to an AA meeting is a desire to stop drinking  That's it    You can absolutely go and observe  I'd even recommend it  If asked to read or speak simply say thank you but you'd like to pass tonight   Expect people to be happy to see you  They'll be welcoming  almost too welcoming  but it's all meant with very good intentions  They want to see you get better  They might give you a list of phone numbers  Don't be afraid to call any of the numbers they give you  Almost everyone in AA who has been sober for half a second is well intentioned    Look for the similarities in the stories to yours  not the differences  Don't walk away saying  "Im not as bad as that guy   So I'm not an alcoholic " Think about the shares and how they relate to you    I don't know how you feel about religion and God but there is an aspect of that and it's not required  If religion isn't your thing  I'd still go along with the prayers out of respect for the people who do find solace in God    Try not to be scared it overwhelmed  Just go and listen   It's also okay if it's not your thing  but give it several meetings before you decide that   There's other programs out there  Find one that works for you   Best of luck  Awesome on two weeks and running   I've never been a great runner  and I am at two weeks too   I am still struggling with running  but it is a whole lot better already   I'm just really out of shape   I have noticed my heart rate is a lot calmer though   Keep it up friend   It gets so much easier   Much more quickly than you think  Thanks for the advice  Can I ask if you suffer from  a persistent cough or sore throat from smoking pot for all those years  Totally agree with enjoy everything less with porn addiction  I got 3 months before the summer  I was finding myself enjoying things I never did before  I'd go to family events to show my face for an hour  4 hours later I was still there and enjoying the company of people I usually only said hi too  Music I love more now than I remember ever loving as much before  It is the way forward this no porn business  Thanks     3 You want instant gratification  Two words  Beef  Jerky  Im only on day 3 right now but the feeling of food is helping with any hankering for a drink I get   you might already know this but your experience was common enough that this led to it being adopted for a smoking cessation product   Beware drinking while quitting smoking   it's an easily slip off the wagon meds or no meds   Beware of drinking on Wellbutrin   they say it lowers the threshold for seizure    Beware of aggressive behavior   this can happen to any wellbutrin user   Getting off Wellbutrin    Listen to your MD and not any advice from us  He might arrange a taper if you stop taking WB for any reason  In my area an open meeting means anyone can go to it  A closed meeting is only for alcoholics or people who have a desire to stop drinking    There's no requirement to say who you are or give a correct name   Also congrats on 6 days  Keep it up  I'm sorry for your loss  Would your friend want you to start your new employment  I won't drink with you today   I'm glad you are here   I will not drink with you today     Or 69 or oral   Do you and your wife do any sexy time at all  Thank you     It sure does feel good to be sober and clear minded  Congrats to you on such a long stretch also     You're absolutely right about that alcoholic voice  It's the thing that keeps me up at night  I'm not religious but I must say it's as though the devil himself is whispering in my ear  "You're OK now  you can handle your booze  look how well things are going  you deserve it  etc "   I'm going to do whatever it takes to shut that voice down because I know nothing has changed   I am still an alcoholic and the road always leads to the same place   a hungover  miserable mess  I refuse to let that voice hold power over me any more  The good thing is I have hit some severe emotional lows over the past few months and I made it through that without picking up a drink so I am going to work hard to maintain that steadfastness  If you don't like drunk you then push her out of your life  She's not worth your time  An SV650 S  2006   Do you ride also  It's the bee's knees  My biggest problem is online gambling  I usually lose everything I can in one night  It's pretty pathetic  I don't really care about money  up until I don't have any left   And if you quit smoking based on them  and you were looking for an excuse to smoke  what better reason than you lied to yourself     "Well fuck I just made that up because I knew quitting was a good idea  so fuck it " I kind of agree with this   If a spouse can't or won't fulfill sex  it doesn't take the needs of the other person away  and it's really a sad situation about his wife  but it's sad he's deprived   I think the wife could work around it if she wants  but  if not  i feel like this would be a good idea  It took about the same amount of time for me to get some sleep instead of tossing a and turning all night   For about a month the after that  I would feel pretty good during the day until about 3 5 pm and then my depression would flare up    Getting good sleep is crucial to getting the neurotransmitter levels back to normal  Ooooh yeah   I bought a makeup set on clearance today for  25  I actually had to talk myself into spending "so much money "  That's half what I would have spent in a single bar tab  not to mention the other  15  20 I was spending nearly every day on beer wine liquor to drink at home     So heck yeah I bought the makeup   And then two new bras  And a calender   And two hats     Okay  at this rate I'm not going to have extra money for long    I'm sorry  this is hard  What about visualizing yourself now  on your way home walking right pass the store without stopping  Plan out every step  every detail   then make it a reality  I won't drink with you today    Wow that's amazing   Good on you   I'm down 15 pounds in 2 months but it has required sooo much discipline   I can't imagine how you did it   I will not drink with you today  Only read your title and I want to shout ONLY THE KIND THAT IS MEDICALLY SUPERVISED    Please please don't do this yourself  or without a medical staff looking over you  I absolutely commend your desire to quit  but you have to live through detox  and I absolutely am convinced that you must do this either inpatient or with an extremely attentive squad of medically knowledgeable people to be with you 24 7 while you withdraw    Best wishes  you are on the road to recovery  I just decided to get sober recently  It is so hard  my god  I feel bored and uneasy without it  But I will not drink tonight  I will not drink with you   Just FYI  Quitters in the early stage of the quit might experience bleeding gums and or mouth ulcers  So the health of your mouth may get worse before it gets better  Good luck  YES  Food is saving me  I didn't drink my usual 2000 calories of champagne on NYE  so instead I ate about 2000 calories worth of charcuterie  Sanity saved   I'll say it now  Faps for Mod  So I did guess correctly  Thanks  The medicine has really helped me tremendously in other areas as well so I have no desire to get off it anytime soon  The loss of desire to smoke was just a bonus for me haha    I just hope that it works permanently cause I feel like I "cheated" if that makes sense    it's been too easy  and I've never been able to quit before now Hah  thanks Freckle  And congratulations to you too   I get so motivated when I see people with such a long stretch of sobriety  It's awesome  Haha  I did a lurker post a couple months ago  but I'd talked in the sub before that and had read the sidebar   I think people help others a lot more than they realize by living good lives and being open and authentic   If you are being good to yourself by not drinking you are also a shining example to all the people who touched your life  Also  supporting people here means a lot to a lot of people   I also believe that synchronistic opportunities to help others happen though out our lives when we are ready for them   Congrats on having over a year  you've helped me by being here      I think I'm mostly a Drunky McDrunkfacecomforting to know AA could help me      Seriously though  thanks for the advice  Especially not looking for differences in other people's stories  Always a self defeating comparison  whether you think you're better or worse than them   I hear you  the bong is a symbol for weed  It's like jumping off the high dive at a pool  so much anticipation and anxiety  but there comes a point where you just have to do it      I thought once I quit I would have so much energy and motivation  I'm only on day 3 but I still feel like I am being lazy and unmotivated  The good thing is you can always learn and grow and change    I know mindset is such a trendy word but it is so true  We don't really realize the power we truly have  Don't expect to be who you were before  you never will be  You have changed and that is a good thing  Don't put too mush pressure on yourself  Just continue to work towards who you want to be and you will be that person in time     Thank you   Yup  got a  600 and a 1000  http   i imgur com jnPki0r jpg    although they are winterized at the moment   Thanks for coming back   I gave up in July over a vacation and was smoking again in September   This year I want to make it stick   I won't have my smoking buddies around  which makes me miss them and the smokes  i think it's awesome that you are here   my drinking and substance use contributed to the end of many relationships  so i can relate there  something magical  or seemingly magical to me  that a friend in recovery shared with me is that addiction depends on its host to be isolated  it depends on me being alone and not having strong relationships  it thrives in my aloneness and needs to keep me from having good relationships in order to survive and grow and conquer me   it was a lightbulb moment for me and helped reinforce my commitment to the sober path   my friendships  romantic relationships and work relationships   job are important to me and i won't keep sabotaging them with my drinking   sounds like you maybe are at this juncture as well   regardless  welcome    i won't drink with you today  Ohhh there's science behind it  Insurance Company actuaries are all over this  You can believe it    I read a paperback book called "Lung Cancer Chronicles" where stats are even graphed an plotted    With a cup of Irish Breakfast Tea in my hand   I will not touch alcohol today    I was 18 when I first admitted to my mother that I was an alcoholic  I didn't try to get sober until I was 27  I wasted nine years until the quality of my life deteriorated sufficiently before I got help  Shit got absolutely horrific  I am more than an alcoholic   I qualify for alanon coda aca and more   The steps work for all of them  for me even as an agnostic and edited some      Many of us asked the question "am I really an alcoholic " And by skid row terms weren't   but it was bad enough we needed do something about it    AA has no rules   "the only qualification for membership is a desire to stop drinking"  Period   Be it a liter of vodka before lunch or three glasses of wine twice a month we don't care      It's really the same thing and sooner is much better for finding recovery than too late  Sometimes it can feel like the devil on your shoulder  that's true  But you need to be stronger than it    After a year and a half  I still have the same tendencies  It was made aparent because I decided to diet  I haven't had to show this much self restraint since I got sober  And I realized I can still rationalize almost anything  But being sober has taught me how to better deal with those types of things   I went to my first few meetings with the intent of NEVER talking  It ended up better that way because I got a real chance to listen  and figure out I was indeed in the right place  Soon I was dying to share my similar experiences  Don't worry about labels  judgement  GOD or anything else except finding a path to getting better   Same here  What a great side effect to sobriety   Congrats    Hey Orange    Don't wait until March  please  Please keep us updated as you go along  You never know when you might inspire someone else  I wish you every success and hope to see you posting here often  Big hugs  xx Lets start the year off right  well  3 days into the year    I will not drink today  I will not be drinking today for the third day in a row  It really is  I was pleasantly surprised by this one  I so feel you on this  All of it  Ready to get to work  yup  And it's also important to know other people like to have a little or a lot of alcohol in their life and that's okay too  I just have to worry about my own life  Well whether your more of a man than a boy or vice versa  you are an addict and therefore you are welcome here    Your story sounds exactly like mine  I was using blues and it turned to heroin  Exactly a year ago from this day  I was in the worst of my addiction  Using everyday  stole everything from my family and friends  did anything I had to do to get my hands on money for drugs  February 1st  2016 I was arrested for possession and intent to sell  I've never had a problem with the law  never even been pulled over before  So when I sat in that jail cell and hated every part of my life  I knew I was done  I did the same thing as you  Sat there and said where the fuck did my life go and how did it end up here  And guess what  After I got out of jail I still ended up using for another 2 weeks  February 16th  2 weeks after getting arrested  I was able to get myself into an outpatient facility  I remember doing my intake at the facility and coming home  Later that night  I thought about how sick I was of using  I started hysterical crying because I didn't want to wake up in the morning and have to pick up to feel normal  I wanted my life back    I called my social worker from the facility that night and asked what can I do  I was desperate  He told me to see if I could find a suboxone doctor the next morning so I could get on suboxone as soon as possible so I could avoid the withdrawals a little  That's exactly what I did  I called around that night and was able to find a doctor who could see me the next morning  I went to the doctor  got my script and the rest was history  I was able to start using the suboxone and my last day using opiates was February 16th  2016    My life is so much more amazing than I could ever imagine  I am going through treatment court right now and have 10 months left  when that is done all my charges will be gone  I am back in school and just finished my first semester with a 3 6 gpa  studying social work  I am happy  healthy and content    It is possible to get your life back  Think of all the energy you would use to sell things to get money  and everything you went through to get drugs  Use that energy to chase your recovery  It is not easy but it is so worth it  Life is so much more amazing  I never thought I could live a life sober  But I have been clean and sober for 10 months and I love it  It is possible  I believe in you  You can do this  Reach out to me  message me if you want  I will help  Good luck and get your life back  you deserve it   sorry to hear that    ugh   nothing feels quite like a post bender recovery feels   i've been there so many times   new year's eve is a tough weekend   i'm glad you were able to truncate things at four days and allow yourself to recover  no matter how painful and nerve wracking it feels   welcome back    i won't drink with you today  Good for you man   It's great to see you have the foresight to recognise the problem early   I started out like you and soon progressed into a six pack every night  making excuses so that I could drink alone at home  always concerned if I had enough beer in the fridge etc     We always look to others to validate our own existence   I think it's called 'confirmation bias'   Looking for others that are worse off then us to justify validate our own perspective on the matter  I will not drink today    New here and finding it very helpful  thank you all   This is day 3  Happy New Year  Congrats on 6 months and a sober holiday season  That's a pretty amazing feat  especially considering the emotional stress  That's actually what I'm dreading the most    I'm 3 days in now  and it's been great  but I haven't had anything truly difficult come up to put my commitment to the test  Kudos to you  You're awesome  Grapefruit canteloupe is amaaaazing   I also love the blackberry cucumber  and cran raz   Ya'll are making me thirsty    I usually keep around a 12pk of kroger lemon lime in addition to my la croix  You are never alone on SD  A world of friends here  I am also feeling alone  Maybe time to get back in the chatroom  xx Today is day three for me  The last three nights I was up until 4AM  3AM  and 2AM last night  I'm glad not to be hung over at work though  and the restlessness will pass    I will not drink with you today  regardless of our bedtimes  I will not drink today  I recently joined a gym  but most of my weight loss has been from better eating habits and abstaining from alcohol entirely   Good to hear you are stopping  I smoked weed most of my life packed up 12 months ago but made the mistake of having some at a new years party  I seriously thought I was going to die my heart was racing all the lights seemed to go really bright  People's eyes were bulging and the floor was breathing I had to sneek out because I couldn't talk to anyone and proceeded to walk home at 3 00am took 3 5hourrs I live 13miles away  I used to love weed now I'm scared of it   Thank you  15 pounds is also amazing  I will definitely not be drinking today    Only on day 2 but I will not drink with you today  I personally think the whole world world can benefit from the 12 Steps  If you want to go you should absolutely go  I see people all the time who are on the fence or have other addictions  All are welcome  I definitely have a cough  I know the lungs can heal so I'm sure it will go away with time  I need to start exercising as I've heard that will help   I also get frequent sore throats and tonsillitis  I never attributed it to weed but now that you say that I'm sure it was from it  I will let you know as time goes on if that gets better too  At about 5 months sober last year  I thought  hey no problem I was at a David Gilmour show  and had a pint with dinner and 2 ciders at the show  you get a pretty good buzz off 2 drinks when you are off the booze for a bit Next came a glass or 2 of wine     within a month I was right back to what I was trying to escape I am not saying nobody on this Sub couldn't do it  but the topic comes and goes and the replies stay pretty much the same   The problem with you "cheating" and easily beating the nic demon is that it was sooo easy that you convince yourself it's so easy that you decide to become a social smoker especially with nights out wwith friends   That's when people make major relapses   Society would never do this  Its a lot easier to attack the cigarette than it is to attack human sexuality  Although  never say never I guess   Great choice  7 days here and I won't drink with you today   I will not drink today  Thank you  The only advice I can give the advice I got was to focus on today  I started worrying about Christmas on day 1 in June    How would I NOT drink mulled wine and spiked eggnog and my "favorite" drinks  By the time I got to Christmas it wasn't even an issue  I just took it one day at a time  You got this  Congrats     Try  r luciddreaming  I learned some techniques to control consciously interact with my dreams  For me it's kind of a long term solution  I don't want to be dependent on anything else to sleep  However lucid dreaming can be so much fun it's difficult to wake up  But it's better than nightmares      Lucid dreaming will help you understand that you are dreaming and ultimately grant you the ability to confront your dream fears and conquer them   I may not always be around but I can never leave lol I think I went three times and after I decided that way wasn't for me  BBBUUUTTTTT the act of going itself was a huge step towards getting where I am today      Update  I am okay  I was feeling too sick and scared to quit cold turkey  and the doctor was not an option so I opted to taper off  I am feeling a lot better now and I appear to be out of the woods  My heartrate and blood pressure are back to what they normally are  I managed to only drink 3 beers yesterday  I still feel kind of weird  but close to normal  The whole tapering experience was really gross and unpleasant  I wouldn't recommend it unless it was the only option  This has been quite an experience and I plan to never get drunk again  I can't give you much advice except don't give up  I'm early recovery myself but it's not my first rodeo  Force yourself to be busy and exercise  eat right all that stuff   oh  and talk to people  that's the therapy   Everyone being a bit different   i'll stop for a period just for the vivid dreams  I cant say I've ever had a nightmare  guess i'm lucky in that regards  Just a guess but are you watching   reading   etc 'scary' stuff before bed Watching local news  They always seems to have depressing stuff  Good luck  struggling with this also    now that i have made the decision  when does it feel "worth it"   when does time speed up again    when will i lose a couple of days    Alcoholics will lie about everything  even if they don't need to      We can be a manipulative bunch  but I was so tired of lying all the time  I was ready to stop     I don't recall having Ativan   But I don't remember anything that was mood altering or affected me in that way    Until the cravings arent there anymore  magically    This was my recommendation too  I've had a LOT of fun with it  However this morning I dreamt that I let a dog lick my pussy  I swear i'm not making this up  and I can't shake the guilt   Nope  Don't tease the disease  Same for the 'what do you think about N A beers ' NO way     for me at least    Happy SOBER '17  Read up on kratom  That's about all I can say here without people getting their panties in a bunch  It will save your life  Right back atcha BillySami   Have a great day  Yeah  I could definitely see that happening  I've been trying to limit my nights out as well  I know that's going to be the hardest thing for me Keep fighting the good fight  I'm with ya  I started drinking at 18  I'm 30 now  I was like you early on  I could go 2 weeks or even 2 months without drinking  but once I started  I didn't want to stop  At the time  it was sort of "cool" to be that crazy partier  We were all young and there was novelty in pushing your limits and getting fucked up  People would brag about how much they drank  etc  But for whatever reason  as I got older  most of those friends cooled down and I didn't or couldn't  You're only 19  Being so young is an opportunity to stop before it gets bad   If you don't want to go full on sober  try moderating  You asked for some techniques  Others might have better ideas  but when I am able to moderate successfully  I try taking smaller sips of my drinks  putting my glass down between sips instead of holding it constantly  forcing myself to wait at least some set amount of time between drinks  maybe 20 minutes   Drinking a big glass of water between drinks is a good idea too   You aren't overreacting  Alcohol is a hell of a drug  but it's glorified and very socially acceptable  That doesn't mean it isn't extremely dangerous  Good for you for thinking about this early on  Good luck  I'm with you  You will get back on track  Don't sweat it  Stumbles happen  Thankfully I've avoided some this venture  last time I had 44 days and relapsed  and before that  8  months  THIS    Hey everyone  Here's another inspiring story from a member of our community  We've got 14 published case studies so far  and looking to add as many as possible  The more stories from our community  the more people will be inspired to take action themselves  whether that's to take the step to quit gaming

Vic's but glad you wanna do the right thing and clean it up  I'm 27 and Iv been doing shit for like half my life  I never really stole or anything but being a dope heads beat  Waking up everyday and the first thought is " how am I getting shit today"  To be honest I'm working on that problem right now  You know how it is  I leave for rehab on Thursday and I'm scared shitless of being sober  Iv never been to treatment before so it's new to me but from what I hear it's a good start  Maybe you can reach out to family and have them help you get into a facility   Read up on kratom  That's about all I can say here without people getting their panties in a bunch  It will save your life    Thankyou Billy  Gonna be a long battle  Welcome  24 year old on day three here  Longest I've gone without drinking since I turned 18 and went to college was just shy of a week  and that didn't happen until October of 2016    There were so many reasons to quit in that span of six years  but I didnt want to face that I had a problem    All that matters is that we're here now  and we do the best for ourselves going forward    Read up on kratom  That's about all I can say here without people getting their panties in a bunch  It will save your life    Read up on kratom  That's about all I can say here without people getting their panties in a bunch  It will save your life    That's fucking hilarious  Read up on kratom  That's about all I can say here without people getting their panties in a bunch  It will save your life    Lope can kill you and I have no idea why people always seem to suggest it here  Congrats  A day at a time for sure  41 year old lurker here   I haven't been sober for more than 2 weeks since 18   I appreciate you sharing your story   Wife and I are ready to make some changes   Keep posting your progress  Hey there  good luck with your mission  I just found this sub after trying to cut back and cut back more  but I still have not been able to get through a day    you're inspiring me though  Feel your pride as you don't give in while walking by  Try holding your breath like driving under   through a tunnel     You got this  Read up on kratom  That's about all I can say here without people getting their panties in a bunch  It will save your life    Really wonderful post  Thank you   "I understand that a large part of my addiction is the nicotine" Your ONLY addiction is nicotine  Your are not addicted to your oral fixation  We smoke vape to relieve the nicotine withdrawal from our previous smoke vape    Reading Allen Carr's book helped me address my addiction and set myself free from the slavery of nicotine  Thank you for that  I appreciate it  Means a lot      I know what you mean  I'm sober now  where are the rainbows and Unicorns  There are none  But treat every 24 hours like an accomplishment bc it is   Happy SOBER '17 I will not drink today  I went a little nutty in December but now I'm back on track  Today is day 6   I would like to remind you that the book says that rarely have we seen a person fail who has thoroughly followed our path  I'm sure that 95  of people that walk into an AA meeting don't thoroughly follow our path  and therefore you really cannot say that this program is harming anyone  You can take or leave AA  but don't blame a program you haven't even tried for your failure   Ive got some nifty tools in my toolbox  Ive got coal for the fire and my war paint on   That is awesome      Sober ing on with you today  too  I've read some stuff about it and helping with ope addiction  Willing to give it a go cause anything is better than more fent  Have never heard anyone up here having it though  from Canada    I actually woke up with a horrible sore throat this am  and chicken broth is doing loads more than my usual hot toddy would   Oh I'm sure I made a freaked out WD post myself at one point   The motherfucking Fear is real dude  I was just thinking about that today  my day two     I just requested a badge reset   I was looking at my credit card and I put  2K on it between November and December  when I started drinking again  I'm so excited to get that part down   the financial aspects of not drinking are so wonderful  Time to pay it off and move on  Thanks for posting  on day 2 CT  used for 5 months and I've quit qt twice now  each time I get through the withdrawl for the most part and start to feel a little better  Then two weeks rolls around and I just don't care to not have it anymore  Thank you so much    For me  the waiting between drinks part doesn't work  because every time someone gets up and says "another round "  I just tag along  Also  I have to pee all the time  and the bathrooms here in Hungary are quite near the bar itself  and you often have to pay a little money for using the bathroom  So I take my wallet with me  and then  as soon as I go back from the bathroom  I'm like  yeah  one more can't hurt    Smaller sips seems fair enough  I will definitely try it  Thank you   And thanks for your words     Most of my friends don't view alcohol as a drug  It's weird for me  We are all liberal  young people  but they will not accept the fact that alcohol is a drug  I cannot understand it  When craving  take a deep breath and say to yourself  "No one ever died from a nicotine craving  I won't either " Pretty much the same here  23 days today and I've kind of felt that progression  Going emotionally kind of wacky this week  Same here BS  I will not drink today  Alcohol Mastery  youtube and podcast   Recovery Radio Network  Sober Guy  Since Right Now The brain does some weird things  I was nearing similar risks with driving and thankfully quit before I got in serious trouble  Thank you for sharing your story  Thanks for posting this  Best of luck to you on your journey  I just found this sub and I have been an on and off stoner for years  I was totally over it and went 3 years without it  Then was diagnosed with general anxiety disorder and prescribed SSRIs  I hated the medication but hated my anxiety mood swings more so I started medical marijuana and since then  about a year now  I can't seem to get away from it even though I know that I feel better without it now  Due to changes in my diet  the anxiety is almost nill but I'm still 'medicating '    That was an excellent post I won't drink today  It's just my second day  but this year I will stick to it  Very effective post you've shared here today  We have all been there  but just remember that the anxious thoughts are all in your head  Relapse is a part of recovery  I'm back on day one as well  and today I won't drink with you   I would love this too   It sounds to me like you might benefit from therapy in addition to any meetings you can make  Best wishes  Dec went fine  Pretty confident in Jan  Hypothyroidism here  I have been symptomatic since 2 yrs into my use  Started meds about 2 weeks ago  Also taking sea kelp and a bunch of vitamins  I have a hunch about this whole thyroid mess and I believe is starts in the gut  Hormone regulation happens in the gut  not production obviously  If your flora is outta whack then hormones don't produce and absorb as they should  My doctor talked about 'perimenopause' as well  I am 37 for God's sake  I am working on identifying the strains of bacteria that are effected  Also have been looking into morphine use in females with gut and flora issue  Apparently morphine DOES destroy certain bacteria and long term users can be in TROUBLE    morpine and kratom are similar in composition  So  if we fix the gut  everything else will remedy itself  Just my 2 cents   a ramble really  I have been working on this daily  I am having symptoms no female is talking about and not sure if posting for everyone to see is necessary  Ladies  if you are having any weirdness or whatever  I am open to discussing  Love it  When will it launch   I have two of these every night   I rotate through all flavors and enjoy them all with the exception of the cantaloupe and the blackberry melon   Favorites are apricot  peach pear  coconut  cherry lime  strawberry pineapple  mango  passionfruit     I recommend lots of ice and a fresh lime or lemon wedge   So good  Exactly  What works for some doesn't work for all  I need proper motivation based on logic and rational thought processes   The addict in me never liked being rational so why should I trust anything that smells like an irrational thought  I try and find gentle things to do   games on my phone  latchhook  coloring  Netflix   It gets better after a couple weeks   Oh and eat everything in sight    That's what worked for me the first month of sobriety after a two year bender   You can be productive later  Putting nicotine into your body in any form isn't beating a craving  it's feeding it and causing another craving  I substituted nicotine with fresh air  The human body does not NEED nicotine  Want cravings to stop  Stop putting nicotine into your body  This is amazingly profound  Okay we have had a few good ones between the two of us   Lmao Just went to the supermarket 10 minutes before closing time  and came home without booze  I feel victorious   P  Of course it is hard  So what  You have to really take a look at yourself and say I am one tough bastard  and I am stronger than the drug  And you have to mean it  Nothing worth having is easy  Smoking weed is the easy thing to do  Grow a pair and stop lying to yourself  Give that bong away  or smash it with a hammer  Get that reminder out of your life    What is it that you really want  Do you want to be clean  or do you want to baby yourself  I am sorry if that sounds harsh  but come on    Everyone here has been through this too  It is hard but you are harder  Stay strong  Ask for help  And get rid of any reminders of the one thing that is ruining your future  I believe in you  more like suck it in  i can't wait to feel less fat  stupid xmas  Ducking kindling is rough though   We are a cruel bunch of fucktards at times     I try and be gentle if someone is really bad off  Thanks for sharing  That's funny and a great lesson on indirect problem solving  Sober '17 to you  Appreciate that for real yo  I was doing pretty bad last year  Verge of just saying  fuck it and offing myself because just frustrated with being a goddamn addict with a broken worthless life and inability to maintain any sort of relationship after they see me go through a few benders minus a few long time friends    But I checked myself into a rehab unit last year for a bit  Not so much to get clean but more because it was free  in a new city with new people  and had counseling  Plus those are one of the few places I can talk about all the shit that's come from being an addict without judgement or being  told I'm just throwing a pity party    I've done better lately tho  Still depressed as fuck but less thoughts about self harm because I'm really working on keeping my drinking in check since my last hospital stay  which was really just like 2 weeks ago but hey  no benders since then   If I'm not constantly drinking my shitty feelings subside a bit  For a while  anyway think i get a new badge today  I will not drink today Thanks  Terrible anxiety today but I know it gets better   awesome I've read that Kudzu can help  No idea if that is true or not  as I've never tried it  Once my physical dependence on alcohol was gone  my cravings were purely psychological  which required their own treatment in my case  I think I started going through several days at a time without craving around the 3 month mark  Good luck  I was talking to a friend the other day about quitting drinking  and apparently HIS friend who was a heavy drinker decided to quit for 30 days  He lost 8 pounds  in a month    started getting 8 hours of sleep  and the funniest thing  his grey beard hairs started growing in dark again  You never know what will change when you cut poison out of your diet  D There are young people AA meetings where I am   Are you in a relatively big city  Congrats on 50  Sober '17 to you  I do go to therapy  I think now im looking for some group support  Maybe healthier people around me  Idk   I guess just support in general   I'm also on day two with a very similar backstory  I've gotten blackout drunk at least 5 times over the past few weeks and I'm tired of black out guilt  of not knowing whether I have drunken hazy memories or whether that was just a weird dream during withdrawal    I wish you the very best of luck  Inspirational  This will be me in about 4 days   unidentifiable figures creatures that frighten the hell outta me  I stopped for 3 months in the summer of 2016 and I had these ALL THE TIME   I would wake up with an unshakable feeling that something was there was watching me   I would literally wake up in terror  grab a pillow or something and swing wildly at the imaginary dark entity that was looming over me   Several times I woke up and would have sworn on my life that I saw lights flicker in the room  Like the clock or smoke detector was blocked and then it wasn't  This convinced me that some kind of specter was hovering over me  One time I even saw a figure approach my bedroom but turn off into another room  Needless to say  these scared the shit out of my wife  who experienced nothing like it despite using and quitting alongside me   I experienced it for many weeks  probably 6 of the 12 weeks I was sober   Eventually  I managed to convince myself that this was the last tendrils of my addiction being removed   I am on day 3 of sobriety now  like many others here  I presume  with no occurrences this time   I can relate to this sooooo much  If you are like me  you probably came from a very chaotic household upbringing  It's hard to shift the norm  even when we become sober  when all we are used to is chaos  This is an opportunity for you to create a NEW norm for yourself  Therapy has helped me immensely with this  Wishing you all the best in your journey  Absolutely this       I'd be interested in this too    There's a brand new one that just came out on HBO called Risky Drinking  It wasn't bad    Congrats on 5 days  So you are down to 0 4g doses  Pearl I would jump right there  I didn't benefit from my tiny  doses at all  I could have taken them or left them  If you aren't adjusting  it's probably enough to piss your receptors off but not enough to do anything  I would jump  love  What do you think  I felt good after stopping  better than the taper  neither was bad at the end   Don't be afraid  You got this  Hey  we have the same quit date  Woo Hoo  Best advise from Mr  Carr  Oh man  YES  "Buying too much is not a thing " Yikes  Good job  Cant wait to be at almost 2 weeks  Good advice   I decided that I'm giving myself a pass on productivity for now   I don't think my brain is to be trusted quite yet   and the pressure I always put on myself when I've been sober for even 12 hours always leads me to booze     Thanks for the pointers   I'll probably mosey on over to the dry sub soon     There are a bunch listed in the sidebar  click on the Video link   I couldn't believe how much money I saved when I stopped drinking  Not drinking is the best thing ever Sounds like you're on the right track  keep it up   If you don't mind my asking  how long did it take to resolve your issues with PIED  I'm struggling with this myself    I feel like I'm finally ready to give up porn for good  but it would be nice if I don't have to wait 6  months to heal my pied    Thanks  and cheers mate   Here I am  I am still not far along in my journey  but further than I thought I could make it   Something strange has happened  I now crave cigarettes  I quit smoking four years ago  The mind and body are interesting things    I will not drink with you all today   Congratulations   It's been 24 hours since I quit  I have been smoking for 10 years now  this is my first serious attempt  I am telling everyone in my social circle so that I have social pressure       Do the cravings ever stop   Awesome post   I have read up on it and I'm so tempted  I'm just worried about trading for a milder addiction that'll just lead me back   Love Recovery Elevator  Since Right Now  and The Bubble Hour   Someone recommended Home to me but I haven't tried it yet    Congrats on making a tough decision  I am proud of you  You should start by getting rid of all your paraphernalia etc  Give it away  of smash it  You don't need it anymore  and it would only serve as a reminder  and an easy way to cheat yourself out of your future  When you start getting that urge  come here and read other people's stories  That can help distract you  as well as give you inspiration  The next few days are going to be hard  but you are WAY TOUGHER  Don't give in  even though it is tough at first  It definitely gets easier  and sooner than you realize  Try to avoid caffeine if possible  and I found that caffeine free tea helped calm my stomach  Keep trying to eat  even if it is only a bite or two  Your appetite will come back in a week or so  Stay strong  You can do this  We believe in you  Second day sober  I'm excited for this new year and I'm ready to  learn about who I am without alcohol  Good luck to everyone  I'm on day 20 and woke up last night because I thought my wife was scratching my back  I said "that feels good can you keep doing that  She said no"   Then I woke up and gave her shit for not scratching my back and then she said "I never said that to you "  Am I going nuts or inception   I stopped thinking in terms that I had a problem  I really realized the need for change when all the time i spent my money  and every waking moment drinking it seemed   I came through a couple hospitals on my journey to this spot   2 years sober now   Thank you for what you do   Like another poster said  you're doing God's work  and I am grateful for you   I was the type in the hospital who was manipulative   Would always try to get my way by "playing" your system   Sometimes this worked and other times it didn't   Recommendation to the people who cared for the old me would have been just do your job   pay me no mind   I will do whatever it takes to get what I want even though I have no idea what's good for me   I want to think a recommendation to AA or a Big Book would have helped   I'm one of those wierdos who had AA stick after I opened the book for the first time   But I think I needed to be pretty far down the scale in order to open it up in the first place    You can read my story here if you're interested  https   www reddit com r stopdrinking comments 5lfp9v recovery from alcoholism ptsd depression anxiety    Honestly  this may sound crazy to you  but I think the best "advice" I could possibly give you is to go to Al Anon   maybe a few open AA meetings   I absolutely commend you for trying to understand your patients   I've found many in the medical profession have no idea about alcoholism or addiction because they haven't experienced it in their own lives  Congrats on 50  Doesn't it feel good to be proud of the things you're doing  Knowing the positive impact it has on you and others   It's a beautiful thing  Like another person suggested  I think a young people AA meeting would be a good idea  They are usually all about doing social stuff  going out together after the meeting  etc   You bring up a good point  I didn't find him  His dad knew I was a recovering alcoholic  he has known for years because I don't hide it  When someone asks if I want a drink I tell them I don't drink because I'm a recovering alcoholic  I don't hide it  it is because I am so open and honest about my sobriety that my friend knew that I was the one to call and I had been in his sons shoes    I encourage all of you to do the same and wear you sobriety as a badge of honor  If you are lucky like me it may just cause you to have the ability to save another   Just take it one day at a time  otherwise it becomes really daunting  I need to reset my quit date to some day in the next few days or weeks  Rereading     I try to distract by brain by doing puzzles or logic games  practicing musical instruments  reading  programming  or watching Netflix   TV   downloaded shows movies  Keep it up  3 months would be a great one to aim for  Way to go brother    The important thing is you know you have this problem and are trying your best to deal with it  We all make mistakes  we wouldn't be facing addiction if we didn't    If you're legitimately trying your best then there's nothing more you can do  Not saying relapses aren't bad but there's a reason we're all here  this isn't an easy thing to do    There's no shame in admitting you need support or having slip ups    Good luck friend    I believe in you  No matter how many times you slip we'll help you back up again   Congratulations  I am coming up on 30 soon and I couldn't be happier to be at 23 after 2 years of daily drinking almost a 5th of vodka after a 8 month sobriety period and before that 5  years of drinking  I won't drink with you  Keep up the positive decision making  Yep  I tried Kudzu Root supplements   I think it helped a little  but it could have been all in my head   I took it for the last 3 4 weeks I was cutting back and maybe another week after I stopped   It's pretty cheap at least so you don't have much to lose if you want to try it  First  thank you for caring  There's many who don't  especially when it comes to addicts  It's probably horrible to say  but I'm an addict who's detoxed many times   I honestly don't think I'd be able to deal with detoxing addicts that regularly  Thank God there's people like you who do the job    I've been in the hospital for non addiction related reasons while still in active addiction  It sucked  I was difficult  I'm sure the nurses used much stronger language to describe me when they were alone  I knew I wasn't really dying  but I damn sure felt like it   I knew these people had access to meds that would make me feel better      and they just wouldn't give them to me  I knew the nurses weren't really in control of that  but honestly it just started to feel like a giant conspiracy to make me suffer  It makes no sense  but that's how I felt at the time  We're not exactly at our best mentally in that situation  Funnily enough I'm actually a pretty calm  non confrontational person most times    Most addicts are  really  good at finding a way to score  It's our full time job  and we're experts at it  Put us in a situation where it's not possible and we lose it  Especially when it's  right there    The truth is like most situations nurses find themselves in  you're seeing people at their worst  Even more so because they're not just there detoxing  they're there for other medical reasons on top of that  You're getting the very worst of them  I'm sure you already know that  but it's all I can think of  I wish you luck though  it's a difficult  draining job you've got   I have tons of respect for people who can stand up and reset their clock Proud to not drink with you today    I think it's worse if it's your breath instead of your shits  but idk  I can tell you it's not sexy to have acetone breath though As you said  it's personal   It's not something I would touch in early sobriety  And I personally wouldn't drink it now and I'm a year and a half in  Alcohol really doesn't have a place in my life  And I made it that way because I will not dance with my devil   Are there other drinks that have similar benefits without the alcohol  I take l tyrosine and l glutamine they seem to help    Beware of drinking on Wellbutrin   they say it lowers the threshold for seizure   Pardon me if I'm wrong  but isn't the seizure threshold raised when you drink alcohol  I think the lowered seizure threshold is only during withdrawal  Wooot     Congratulations  I keep trying to find it but can't  There is a great post on another forum about a guy who documented everything for about 2 3 years    It said it took him about 18 months to feel back to normal  Shweppes Black Cherry seltzer    I tried Lacroix a few times  Always wondered why it was the most go to talked about drink on here  Didn't care for it   If you're willing to do whatever it takes I know you'll find help   But you have to be willing to drop all your preconceived notions   try out a new way of thinking   An unfamiliar one that your ego will fight tooth   nail   People in AA have been where you are now   And they're willing to help     Go to 90 meetings in 90 days  get a sponsor   work the steps   If you really want a new life that's how I did it  that is really good  i hope you keep going you can do this  I say no pressure for the first month   Only stuff that relaxes you and makes you happy   Fap gave me some really good advice when I was fighting my impulses which was to take 10 or 15 mins and list the pros of drinking and the cons of drinking when I have the uncontrollable urge   Than list the pros and cons of not taking that first drink   Then if I still thought it was a good idea go ahead and drink   I think just distracting yourself when you have the urge helps   Tell yourself if it's still overwhelming after a half hour than you can  Just send nudes    All will be forgiven   Cold turkey was very easy for me  I know cutting it off slowly would've been very hard for me  So what I'm saying is we all have different methods that work best for us  find yours and stick to it  I'm in the same boat  I had 25 days  My "slip" lasted a few weeks though  Back to what feels worse than square one this time  WDs much more intensevomit wisebut seem to be tapering after about 100 hours in    Mentally  I'm a bag of fucking ass   If you were a nighttime smoker  in 5 7 days you'll begin dreaming again  I had some nightmares and some very strange  vivid  and reoccurring dreams  Headaches are also common when quitting smoking weed  I know I got them in the 1 2 month range  For me  cravings were awful for the first 3 days  After going that long without smoking  however  you'll start to feel more confident and more able to go without weed  Sadly  however  this initial confidence high will wear off and you'll start to miss that feeling of coming up off a dank indica  I think the key to commitment is finding another activity to distract you  you have to be able to channel the cravings  because they will haunt you like a phantom  For me  they got progressively worse with time   What a brilliant post  and I feel exactly where you're coming from  I posted about being incredibly high functioning  and was met with responses of people who questioned that although I may be high functioning  was I functioning as highly as I could if I was sober  The answer was no    It's so easy to look at the horror stories  as you call them  and justify your own actions on a sliding scale of how it  could be a lot worse   The reality is that drinking has certainly made me  a lot worse  than I once was  It's fundamentally changed who I am  I'm so happy to hear stories like this  they make me feel like I'm not alone in this  Sometimes you just gradually slow down and quit  ween yourself as it were  but that can also be dangerous because it can lead to a false sense of security  and slowly it can creep back up   Do you want to quit for real though  like permanently  or are you trying to get through it and manage your alcohol consumption  Forcing myself to drink less than enough to black out was torture   This is my first ever day one  I will not drink today   We are here for ya  Digital sober buddies     Yay CA Santa  I was a week late  but it's been sent today via Amazon  Should fit through a letterbox easy enough  hope you enjoy it  Thanks for my superb scarf   it's perfect    Ahh and thanks to our hostess for somehow managing to bring us participants a little extra unexpected joy  Nope  Read the below for more info  Its a wall of text but worth the read     Wellbutrin  bupropion  is a prescription medicine used to treat depression  As with other medications  it is known to cause a number of side effects and it appears that seizures are one of them  It is thought that Wellbutrin lowers the seizure threshold of an individual increasing the possibility of occurrence  Compared with Wellbutrin regular tablets  the longer acting form of this drug  Wellbutrin XL  has a lower chance of causing seizures  What Studies Say   Clinical studies conducted before this medication was approved by the FDA show that around 4 out of 1 000 people taking Wellbutrin  with a daily dose of up to 450 mg  experience seizures  The risk of seizures is dose dependent such that people who take higher doses have increased chances of experiencing a seizure  Furthermore  the likelihood of a seizure is increased during initiation of treatment and at every dose adjustment  Also  some people have higher risk of developing a seizure compared to others   Studies further show that seizures were less common among people taking Wellbutrin sustained release or extended release tablets  Alcohol  Drinking excessive amounts of alcohol may increase the chances of experiencing a seizure while on Wellbutrin   Post marketing reports suggest that consuming alcohol while on Wellbutrin can cause acute episodes of neuropsychiatric events  It has also been shown that bupropion may likely reduce a persons tolerance to alcohol  High Risk Population for Wellbutrin Seizures  Some people are at increased risk of experiencing seizure with Wellbutrin  People with history or existing seizure disorders are at the greater risk of developing seizure with this medication  Wellbutrin is contraindicated in people with seizure disorders   This medication is also not recommended in people with history or current eating disorders  particularly bulimia and anorexia because of the increased incidence of seizures in these patients  It is also contraindicated in people with severe liver impairment or cirrhosis   Caution should be taken when using Wellbutrin in patients who have predisposing factors for seizures  including underlying neurologic abnormalities such as brain damage  head trauma or CNS tumors  addiction to street drugs such as stimulants  cocaine  and opiates  chronic alcohol problem or abrupt withdrawal of alcohol use  use of insulin or antidiabetic agents for diabetes  use of sedative agents  and use of other medications that can lower seizure threshold    First  I would not lie and second  I would do what I was told   This is golden   That's what I did as well but it wasn't an intentional effort   Sometimes today I catch myself telling the truth  much like I used to catch myself lying  and I just smile to myself  I was never cut out for moderation but I'm posting to wish you good luck  yes i am at the same place i wish i could drink moderately but it never works that way  alcoholism is a disease and we have to be sober for the rest of our lives if we want to feel better and become the person we want to be and live a better life  we have to take it one day at a time and work on ourselves  you can do this  go one week  then 2 weeks then 3 then 4  and so on  and before you knw it you've made a month  2 months 3 months  you will have ups and downs  and remember nobody said it's easy  there are gonna be times where this is really hard but find alternative ways to cope  healthier and better ways  and make sure you do things you want to do  and take your time to heal and relax and take it easy on yourself  Staying alive   I'd be interested  Thanks Sophie  Oh nothing external ever makes us angry  it's always an inside job   https   www amazon com You Cant Make Me Angry dp 0965967212 ref sr 1 1 ie UTF8 qid 1483478433 sr 8 1 keywords you cant make me angry Not sure what the half life would be  probably depends on your liver functions and how healthy that is but I don't know  I think last time I had Librium they told me not to go more than 6 hours without iirc I'm on Day 8 and I didn't go to work  I'm a mess and very unhappy  I have other things in my life going on and I just want to smoke to avoid thinking about it  I'm sorry you're going through this  I feel you  Yeah man it's freaky as hell  I will dream that I am in a dark hallway and there is this old woman wearing a red shirt  but had massive almost gorrila like arms that would drag on the ground and she would run toward me in the dark hallway    I would never see her until the last second  and whoosh over and over again  Like this monster like thing that appeared in flashes and when I ran to escape the stairwells led to other stairwells  but no real way out   It already passed      Feelings  so weird  Holy shit  what a great idea  I just started my stopwatch haha  It's a stupid subreddit and we are all stupid and should die in a fire    Seriously    Who misses 7 flights   Morons   Keep it up  You've got support here  Congratulations  Many more to come   Same here  I thought you liked me     I got sober at 24  Let me tell you what  it is awesome  I got involved in AA and don't miss the drunk days    It's not always sunshine and rainbows and roses in sobriety  but it's a heck of a lot less issues  I'm more and more content more and more of the time  I'm over 3 months clean now and I also was a light sleeper and had night terrors  They went away after about a month and now I sleep as well as when I smoked and wake up feeling even better  Stick with it man  Keeping a consistent bed time and only going to bed to sleep helped me  Try not to spend time in your bed when you aren't ready to go to sleep  I e  Surfing the web or watching Netflix in bed    This is so exciting to see  I decided to finally kick booze for good just before new years  Beforehand I was absolutely wracked with fear that I wasn't going to make it to the 28th of Jan  as we were paid early on 21st December    I have about 350 after bills to spend on myself  which I was terrified wouldn't last me  Now I've given up all of my anxiety has miraculously disappeared because of just how certain I am I'll make it through the month with ease  Roll on next pay day where I should be able to save somewhere in the vicinity of 1k in a month   Well done to you  Glad you had a great Christmas   you deserved a treat  you've earned it  Very happy for you  I've never heard of Celebrate Recovery but looked it up and it's a Jesus based AA apparently   May I ask why that instead of AA    It's hard to think about never being able to enjoy even one glass of wine again   So let's not think about that  right  You cheered me up this morning  so let's check in again tomorrow and not drink just for another day    That's pretty good advice  A free pass for a month sounds great   I'm glad you're feeling well  I'm on day 38 off of subs   I was definitely still in the trenches on day 11  but it was starting to get better  Really  it gets even better from there on out    I still have some symptoms  I still sneeze a lot  Yawn a lot  Every now and then my stomach will act up a little  I still have some trouble sleeping sometimes  but I hesitate to even complain about that because it's nothing compared to the first couple of weeks  All in all really mild stuff  Easy to handle   Anyway  congrats  I'm really happy for you  Big phat congrats my sober twin   Here's to 31  Without trying to encourage gambling  if you've got the addiction  you may as well manage it  Have you tried opening a separate account and transferring a fund in there to spend on gambling  You'd be surprised how just having money somewhere else is an easy deterrent when the urge to just put that last   10 dollars on the wheel  I've been listening to the This Life podcast with Dr  Drew and Bob Forrest  You are not unjustified  but there may be a better path through this alcoholic minefield    Alcoholism affects the whole family  so your sister's text is not surprising because everyone in the family is trained from an early age to protect the alcoholics' right to drink   You are clearly fed up and you don't want this drama and abuse anymore     When I got to that point  I had all the wrong tools   I thought it was important to fix what was wrong and to make them realize the error of their ways   Alanon helped me see how to be free of the drama   Today  my life is too awesome to waste any of it arguing with anyone   If other people want to be assholes  I don't have to stick around     Alanon gave me the tools I needed and it can do the same for you if you want   Go to meetings  try a few different ones to find the right fit   Listen to how other people handle loving an alcoholic   Do what works for you  avoid the mistakes others make   Learn from others' experience and it can save you a lot of trial and error    Hahahaha   Sorry Lem but you do have fabulous incredible stories    I know many people have posted GREAT advice  mine is simple and to the point  and I will do it in steps you should do it in   1  Tell those close to you  those you stole from  those that deep down know it already  but still love you    You will need support  and also you have to make right all the wrong you did  even if they don't forgive you and you lose them out of your life   As long as you try to make things right you will find some peace  2  BURN THE BRIDGES   You must change your number  go and do anything you can that will make you NOT be able to buy your DOC again   I personally went in debt to my dealer so I can not go back without paying massively   Delete all numbers to ANYONE that uses or you can score from  This is important  your friends that use  well they no longer are your friends   You will realize why this is important later on  3  Prepare for HELL  and get as educated as you can on both Acute  and Post Acute WD   You will find most people are scared of the physical  ACUTE  WD  but soon learn why the Post Acute are the true test   You can research it under PAWS  which is Post Acute Withdrawl Symptoms  4  Don't give up  you can do it   get help from Doctors if you need be  but the biggest thing is be honest with the docs  Of course some will judge you  or refuse to help you but if your honest you will find that one that will help you  5  This is kinda up to you  but don't be afraid to use Opiate Replacement  Suboxone  or other drugs that help   but that is something you need to talk to a doctor and your support about   In the end you can do this is you are serious about wanting you life back  It's the hardest thing you will ever do  and the battle does get easier with time  but never needs  You have to keep your guard up at all times   Disclaimer  I am not a doctor  nor in the medical field  I am giving advice as I worked for me  nothing more   Use this advice as you see fit  and in the end remember we have ourselves only to blame   GOOD LUCK OP  I walked by my favorite liquor store today  I was tempted because it's my day off and they have a huge wine and beer selection  I have the house to myself and no one would know  I played the tape all the way through and I pictured my anxiety tomorrow with the guilt and the night sweats  It's not worth it  I will not drink with you today  You are strong    Irish here too  There's plenty to do without drinking although it certainly feels like a lot of our social life revolves around bars   Honestly I found expanding my horizons and meeting new people whose whole life didn't revolve around pubs was the way to go for me last time I was sober  I met my partner that way     Are you near Dublin  I'm not but have heard things about Clockwork Door recently  Lots of towns have board game places or try meetup groups for non alcohol events   I also got really into running and the gym  which usually led to some of us heading for coffee after classes plus I did parkrun every Saturday morning  You deserve it baby  Shit feeling is normal  Probably missing all that sugar too  Try eating a candy bar  This is a really hard part of recovery that no one tells you about  I didn't have friends all through my eating disorder and I am finally able to get to know people now and allow them to get to know me  The only thing I can say is it takes a lot of time and a willingness to be open with others  Best of luck   We'll leave a light on for ya     Sounds like a good plan   I hope you continue to stay a part of the SD community   The folks here really have been my mentors and a life line when I was feeling shaky   I won't drink with you today  Make it a habit to wake up and get out of bed immediately and meditate  That'll help a lot  TOOT THAT HORN  Huge congratulations to you  I can't wait to be where you're at   just wait for my post  It'll likely be garbled rubbish and full of misspellings from excitement  I will not care  Glad you're back Fantastic    50 days is huge  So I smoked all day every day for about 7 8 years  Today is day 11 for me  but things are actually really good for me today  What worked for me is making a schedule  Like you  I don't have many hobbies outside of smoking  and I also barely have any friends     So it can be hard to find things to do  This morning I woke up  went to work  and when I come home I plan on cooking dinner and doing laundry  then bed  So for me  it's not this extravagant thing of "oh  I'm going to learn how to play an instrument and then become a marathon runner" because I know that  for me  that won't happen  BUT that stuff has never really been a goal for me  If you have always had a mind to want to play piano  learn it  I guess all I'm trying to say is that you don't really need to set up all these huge things you want to do  you just need to have an idea of what you will be doing each day so that you don't end up bored  Just stay strong   This sub also helps me a lot    When I get down on myself or feel like smoking I just come here   I'm a smoker  I would like to quit    I think to know in advance that the initial parts of quitting are hard  I usually find the first ten days really tough  After that it's just habit breaking  Try and avoid waiting for long in places you usually smoke  Eg outside the pub  At the bus stop    Good luck  I have successfully quit before but stupidly started again  If you fuck up once it doesn't mean you can't try again  Don't beat yourself up and don't worry about failing   Guess I need to figure out who I am without the alcohol then  Thanks   It won't lead you back if you really want it  You have to be 100  ready to get better  Glad t see you back   Sorry you're hurting   As you know  you never have to feel this way again if you don't want to  Good luck at work  You can still do it    I drink it  Doesn't trigger me in the least  I'm very committed to gut health for other reasons  You're right  I was unaware that Wellbutrin had an effect on the seizure threshold  Have an upvote   I will not drink today     Those 5 little words are changing my life     I'll happily join you in saying no thank you to that first drink today  Chiming in here  I'm updating my badge today now that I got to the web   New Years eve  a little bit turned into too much   Same old song and dance   January 1st was wasted on a hangover    I will not forget the long successful stretches I accomplished over 2016 and I feel good still    Hope you are not discouraged  and find peace and accomplishment with what you've succeeded in thus far  I'm sorry you're having a hard time   What's going on  Preach on  This is spot on  I'm 20 and I reached this conclusion as well   Yeah  Hungover me is almost as bad as drunk me  you gotta give yourself time to dry out to finally get back to real you  which for me takes around two weeks if I'm coming off a bender  But you'll notice it and realize why sobriety is much better than brief moments of relief brought on by a chemical Thanks for the update    This is great to hear  I'm glad you're getting along with your counselor and that you're going to try an AA meeting   Keep it up   You know I like you  That's why you fap at work so often  17 days including christmas and new year  thats a high degree of difficulty  You have done the hardest part  Congratulations  Tried spending less time at a computer  8 Hours is a lot  My own experience has been quite different  The first few times I quit drinking  I kept it to myself  I'd just casually not drink at events  People definitely noticed and would make jokes or really push the issue and make rude comments about how I wasn't being any fun   This time  I did about a month of prep work    I called a friend of mine who quit drinking a log time ago  I then went to my best friends  one by one  and explained the seriousness of everything  That I have been lying to all of them for years about how bad it is and I either need them to help me and not enable me or go away  Then I started with my mom  and worked my way through the family  One on one "reverse interventions" I called them   Then it went to coworkers and acquaintances  Distant family  Anyone who would listen  I did all of this while I was still drinking   Then my mom and I   I'm 25  but my mom and I are very close  discussed a back up plan    if I relapse again  it's time for rehab    Now  instead of doing it alone  I have countless people who know and are supportive  The people who took it lightly the first few times are now taking it extremely seriously    On December 31st  I woke up hung over as shit and sent a mass text to all my friends and family and told them "It starts now    No more drinking  Ever "  I finally had the support I needed  A few friends cancelled their new years plans and came over to my house to drink tea    I'm only 3 days sober  but I'm feeling confident that when  not if  I feel like relapsing  I will have the strongest yet harshest support system to keep this train on the tracks    It works differently for everyone  and I wish you the best on your newest journey    I will not drink with you today  Yup  It's so wonderful that I can still go outside with my fiance and not feel like the odd Man out  He is wonderfully supportive and not ready to quit so I do my thing and he does his No kidding   I think I've already lost 5 pounds even though I have been eating fairly well    I had a ginger one today  It was delicious  The bacteria in my gut already produce small amounts of alcohol  so it's not like I can completely avoid having a few molecules in me  Thanks   Happy to hear that  I know my match got their gift because amazon told me so  Hopefully my gift was just lost in the mail or something    Glad to see you back It is so dicey  My father was alcoholic  I didn't know anything as a young kid  He drank  but it wasn't anything until so much later  Only years later did it become really obvious  It could have gotten worse sooner  I think  if Mom wouldn't have covered for him  Her hiding her pain from us was necessary  but it also hid us from the reality of addiction  This is both good   bad  I'm on day three and have this as well  It's dull and not painful enough to take painkillers but it's there  Day 22 and it seems 2 steps forward 1 step back is the new normal for me   I dont even care about kratom anymore  dont even have cravings   Im just trapped in this hell of crippling depression and cryptic existential panic   Ill have a decent day  where I start thinking  hey  Im coming out of the woods  then the next day will suck   Yesterday  again  actually thought  I think I may have turned that proverbial corner  then today has been shit     Coming back to the office after a long break and a lot of personal changes  back to an office which isnt exactly a joyous place for me be  hasnt helped   But why the fuck am I so obsessed with the paradoxical nature of existence   Its starting to piss me off  just obsessive compulsively playing out in my head  none of it makes sense  how am i alive  how is anything anything  none of it makes sense gahhh   The reason I dont even crave kratom is because I know it wont make these thoughts and feelings go away  and at this point thats all I truly care about   Fuck  I know the answer is to stop worrying about it and just live  but I cant   The only respite I get is having a six pack and a bowl in the evening     Its as if with kratom Ive corrupted my mind  and I feel Ill never get back to where I was  and where everyone else seems to be  that mindset that allows one to simply be without incessantly questioning EVERYTHING 24 7   Im sure tomorrow will be better  possibly will be my best day yet   You know 23 is a magic number  P     But seriously  Ive never experienced anything like this in the years Ive used kratom  the multitude of times Ive kicked  so what gives   And this stuff actually started months back while I was still using  its not even like it just started after I quit so I could easily attribute it to WD PAWS   Im quite convinced that my daughters birth  such a powerful experience that was  and coming out of the haze of 2 years dependent on kratom to this new life that Im not sure I ever really wanted  and Im a tad frightened by the sheer depth of the necessary commitment having a family entails  but at the same time Im eternally grateful to have been given this family  so trying to mentally adjust to all the thoughts and feelings that come along with it  these thoughts and feelings that I havent actually experienced naturally due to the addiction  is probably causing most of this   I must be having some sort of existential crisis in the throws of kicking kratom   Let me tell you its a doozy   I've kicked methadone 20ml  best friend was murdered when we were both 12  but NOTHING has made me feel this shitty and worthless   Fuck this plant  Im so done with this shit   Fuck me for abusing it  mostly   I just want my natural ecstasy back   Tired of being anxious  worried  and scared all the time   This is not me  Going to look into it right now  Thanks  man  Thanks  Congrats to you  too  Thank you for this I would go to a different grocery store  That exactly mirrors my experience so far   I'll add that I spend at least an hour a day dedicated to learning how to stay sober  mostly on SD   and that I've started with a therapist to get at some of my underlying issues    None of it easy  but all of it worth it    That poor kitty    I'm also 22 and my entire social circle tends to focus on drinking so I really sympathize  My badge says two weeks but I've been sober for months at a time before relapses and I can't say the social thing is particularly easy but I've found a few things that make it a little easier     Firstly  I avoid drinking situations at all costs  seriously  my attempts at sobriety only started getting successful when I finally stuck to the dry people  dry places advice I loathe so much     If I do end up in a situation with alcohol  I make sure I've told my friends I'm not drinking and come armed with my excuses that way I'll feel embarrassed if I go back on my word     again     What I've found helps the most is being pro active about inviting my friends to do sober things with me  I don't explicitly mention that it's a sober activity but I'll ask them to go bowling with me mid afternoon or invite them over to my place mid week to watch a movie  It's actually improved my relationships with my friends because we're choosing to hang out and be present instead of it being the usual weekend piss up where none of us remember anything and  if we're brutally honest  we were there to get drunk  not chat with each other or socialize    Good luck   Thanks and congrats to you  too  We've got this  Yeah  It was the realization that I don't actually enjoy cigarettes that made it easy to quit  I was like  hold on    if I dont actually take pleasure from this  then all I'm doing is PAYING MONEY  TO GET CANCER  I can't think of a worse deal than that  For me  alcohol was a symptom of a greater maladjustment  and I have been treating myself with AA  I've been to countless psychologists throughout the years  and stuff they recommended to me to treat depression is part of the AA program  so I'm pretty happy about being part of it  My blood pressure spiked a bit when I quit  A headache can be a lot of things  but a BP check might be a good idea  Hi  TheLoneOrphan   Thanks for sharing your story  I can relate to it a lot   That's awesome news you have made a doctors appointment  Being upfront and honest about your drinking to them can only help you  You'll get the best advice on how to handle your sobriety safely  I won't drink with you today x Totally relate  I have thinking problem  which led to a drinking problem  Just ordered both  Thank you  You got this mang  You can do it  Come and get support here when you're not feeling motivated  It's worth it  After a mortifying black out on New Year's  surrounded by industry friends that I have to look at daily  I'm ready to change  I'm using this as fuel to keep myself accountable  I will not drink today   Yes  I've just gotten good at the 'playing the tape forward' tactic you're talking about  Makes me feel like such an adult to forego short term fun pleasure for longterm happiness and health    Congrats on 17   I literally just print screened and printed that comment out  Thank you so much  man  That really made me feel better   I already feel SO MUCH better now than when I typed out this post  Strange how the cravings can really take control if we let them  I was seriously about to say fuck it and smoke after the gym today  Instead I just distracted myself and stayed clean  Keep it up  Thanks again  Just kidding  my friend  Awesome  I go back to the doc in 3 weeks  It'll be about 60ish days sober at that point and I'm really curious how the blood panel and blood pressure are going to shake out  Great to hear this kind of report  Awesome job  you can get back to you x I won't be drinking with you today  Hell yeah  Keep it up  Pretend it's a prison  because it is   Hello  everyone  I have been struggling with boredom the past few days now that the holidays are over  Everyone is back at work  back in their home states  or both  so it looks like it's just me  myself  and I for now  Working on waking up earlier  hit the gym  and have been moving back and forth between reading and reddit the past few hours  So needless to say the 24th can't come soon enough    I wrote down a list of my goals for this year and also looked at my goals from last year  I didn't quite get all of them last year but I did get a lot  So my goals this year are more of the same   Get my cumulative GPA to 3 2 3 3  get to 170 lbs bodyweight with various strength goals  meet new people  pursue romantic interests  read AT LEAST 5 books but shooting for 10  and network to hopefully get an internship  Basic but achievable    Tomorrow I have to go to the GI Doc  I may have to get a colonoscopy in the near future  however  TMI  there hasn't been any blood in my stool for a few weeks now  So hopefully it's not anything major    Have a nice day guys    I would love to  however  it is my job  If i were able to get away from my desk   computer  it wouldn't be for more than 1 hour at most   I do my best to stay busy in what I do to avoid temptation though   Keep it up  One day at a time indeed  Way to go  I drink it   It never triggered me  and was a nice replacement early on when I just needed something to drink at the appointed booze hour instead   That said  YMMV  A shit load of food and perhaps some video games  My God  we sing the same tune  I'm happy to see that I'm nor alone and that we can fight the beast together  I will not drink with you today  raising the mug of coffee    A meeting will help     It's not surprising that people are throwing blame around   Everyone in an alcoholic family has highly developed blaming skills  It's part of why the disease is so powerful   You do not need to internalize the blame     I learned that there was no way to please my parents  alcoholic mom  enabling dad    They needed someone to blame and it really didn't matter what I did  it was not going to be enough to satisfy the gaping hole in their lives caused by alcoholism     They can say all kinds of shit and it does not make it true    Your gf's continued drinking is 100  her responsibility   You could hand her a case of vodka and it's still her choice to drink it   Help is available  free   when she wants it  Until then take care of yourself and let her face the consequences of her decisions    Sorry to hear this  Please only post when sober   this is explained in the  participation guidelines  https   www reddit com r stopdrinking wiki index wiki post only while sober   for this subreddit     We recognize that many people spend months "lurking" this subreddit while drinking  You are welcome to read as much as you'd like while not sober  However  for the sake of everyone here  and for the sake of your own recovery  please only post or comment when you're sober  "Sober" means "not currently intoxicated or under the influence in any way "  In the meanwhile  there's lots of information in the posts here and lots to explore in the sidebar    Checking in  Could be anytime of the day honestly  The moment I get bored and not have something to focus on my mind wanders off   And I have this obsession with finishing an entire video  Like  I must know what happens   S Just a bit will snowball into me constantly going back to it  Been trying to find stuff to do  better still get out of the house  It's pretty effective for me  I read all this stuff on the label when I first got the medication  but hot damn  I don't drink that much but I did have a problem with opiates  which my doc knows about   I wonder why it's contra indicated for people with eating disorders  I don't have one but sometimes I forget to eat   if I'm gonna have a seizure from missing a meal I will be more stringent about not doing that  Haha me neither  Not drinking today   Wow  I've collected a few 24 hours of sobriety  but never thought to listen to a podcast about it  thanks for the great idea  Checking in  They say that routine is big  Making sure you go to sleep at the same time and wake up at the same time  Make a ritual of it  When I was withdrawing I could not sleep a wink  It's been 3  weeks of sobriety now and I'm finally able to sleep some nights  but other nights I need to take a Tylenol PM or an Ativan to help get to sleep  I've always pretty much had issues sleeping but    I've always pretty much drank  Previous to being sober  I'd just pass out   black out  The problem with that was  it was never restful sleep   Now I just pop a Tylenol PM and listen to thunderstorm tracks on YouTube or music and relax all my muscles  Also finding a good position you like to sleep in helps  I'm a side stomach sleeper   Keep it up  Hiding it from other people allows us to hide it from ourselves  don't u think  It's crazy when reality hits u and you're like 'omg  I have a major effing problem '   I have a major effing problem  And there's no easy way to get to the other side   Me neither   Same  We can do this   I'm also on Day 1 again lol  good luck to you    I talk about this often  It's THAT drive that's needed for a quit to stick  You have confidence built from a steady taper  you are more clear headed than ever  and ready to tackle whatever comes your way  The day it happened for me  I wept  Boo hoo thank God  It's like you see what's waiting for you  It's glorious  Congratulations and keep at it  Proud of you  Seriously and I mean this   'good for you   '  I have almost blurted out before 'I can't get off the Kratom' and things to that affect  It's a heavy secret  Maybe if I taper to a low dose and am prepared to actually quit entirely  I'll be ready to tell someone   Keep at it you are just starting to get a clearer picture  Your head really hasn't gotten good yet  It takes a while  but so worth it  Plus getting clean does mess up the high or the drunk when you go back  It just gives you clarity   makes you wonder why you liked being messed up   you wind up chasing something you can't find or truly feel ever again  Scary  Plus it gets so darned much worse it hurts to think about it  It's been almost three weeks for me  and I still feel stupid  I don't know how long it'll last but last time I got sober it was months it feels like  I'm a smart guy too  went to college and graduate school  part of the shame of my life falling apart due to alcohol  and sometimes I am at a loss for words or can't remember things that recently happened  conversations I've had  commitments I've made  etc  It sucks  It's a waiting game  Just stay sober and it will come back  I'd guess 3 to 6 months at the minimum  depending on how long you've been drinking and how much  I may be slightly drunk   making the best of the next week   but you know  even though we've ever met  I'll fucking die for you  That's been extended to three people in my life  Now four  I could have written most of this post myself   Not drinking today  I can relate to this so much  I spent from 14 21 heavily drinking and eventually got into drugs as well  I became a daily drinker around 19 20  I thought alcohol was a part of me  I thought I loved myself drunk because I was so much fun  But slowly I began to lose friends because of my substance use  It happened over and over  Then I had to start relying on drugs and alcohol to function  After high school I tried stopping so many times but couldn't do it  I hated myself so much  after all the years I thought I loved myself when I was drinking  I felt so much embarrassment everyday for the night before   You can do this  I'm about to be 22 and have been doing well after getting out of residential treatment in august with a couple relapses  but I like myself more than I ever have in years    Being around people that are drinking is hard  I had to stop hanging out with a lot of people  It doesn't have to be a forever thing  but at least when your first starting out   It is possible  I thought I was going to die an active alcoholic  but now I don't believe I will   PM if you want  "bloated and dehydrated"     Yuck    very accurate description though  I hate the awful thirsty feeling   The not sleeping part is common in the early stages of quitting drinking  I've asked the that question and have been reassured  it gets better x Good on you for pouring that bourbon down the sink and getting it out of your house  I have taken alternate routes home and intentionally shopped at places that do not supply alcohol just to avoid the temptation   You can keep at it  Keep fighting  I won't drink with you today Im definitely not drinking today  or tomorrow for that matter  Thanks    I agree  better rip of that band aid  You're stronger than you think you are  We all are  Congrats on 3 days  that's huge  I had a tough time getting to sleep the first few weeks  but now I sleep better than I have in years  so long as I don't drink too much caffeine  that is      I have not yet gotten tired of waking up not having had a drink the day before  That's good every day   I'm not sure if it's worth it to me  I haven't tried it  For today though  I'm not drinking    Do you remember the name of the podcast  Wow  Thank you seriously  I'm honored  Studying the effectiveness of Wellbutrin in bulimics  So why not Wellbutrin  The answer comes from testing the drug in bulimics  and its not good news  In four out of 69 patients with bulimia treated with Wellbutrin  gran mal seizures were the unfortunate result  A gran mal seizure is a medical emergency and can be fatal  The manufacturer mentions this in their literature   WELLBUTRIN is contraindicated in patients with a current or prior diagnosis of bulimia or anorexia nervosa because of a higher incidence of seizures noted in patients treated for bulimia  I'm glad you're still here  too  You can do this  I won't drink today with you  Hi there  The first time I said I was an alcoholic at a meeting  I ugly cried for the remainder of the meeting  Saying it actually let me feel it  but I was so beaten down by that point I was desperate    After that first time  it felt almost therapeutic to say it because it gave me a problem that had a solution   That being said  you absolutely don't have to identify  In meetings where people go around the room and introduce themselves  you can always say "I'm so and so  and I'd like to listen for today" instead of identifying  Almost everyone I have encountered has been truly kind    Best of luck  OP   Even when you get off easy  it's still hard  so congrats    I seriously love hearing stories from people who are able to catch it  before  they lose everything   end up buying dope from a stranger in a bad part of town   shooting up questionable product in a dirty convenient store bathroom  Not that I've ever been there  cough   cough   Seriously  great job brother    Stay strong   Idk about you guys but quitting porn has left me dreaming up some weird stuff  I swear I'm 100  straight  But a few weeks ago I dreamt about humping a guy  I woke up really disgusted and confused   X  2 days ago I dreamt I had sex with some girl on my doorstep  At least it was a girl this time   But I'd never come close to doing either irl  It's weirding me out  I can relate to a lot to what you've written  especially the self loathing    Alcoholism runs in my family as well   One of my family member's drinking terrifies me  and as concerned as I am  I couldn't help but feel like a fraud since I had my own issues as well   Do you have any support   I found a therapist and listening to recovery podcasts very helpful    Hi  Dean     I will join you in not drinking today   Awesome work on 31   Thanks  it does help I stopped drinking for about 5 months when I was 21  It was really really hard at first because I stopped right before university Christmas break and all my friends were home and partying hard  I went to bars and house parties and managed to stay sober  It felt SO good  I went back to the city flying high and continued being sober  No more waking up from a blackout nauseous  ill  and  shot through with fear  shame  and embarrassment  No more continual anxiety at past  and future  drinking   No more hiding  I was happy  healthy  and most importantly  I had equanimity and had the peaceful sleeps of someone with a gulit shame free conscience   It was wonderful   The my best friend came and stayed on my couch and I got him a job at the same restaurant as me and in a flash my sobriety was gone  It's taken me 20 years to surpass that continual sobriety mark I hit at 21 and that's in the last year  In those 20 years I've totalled a car  spent 4 days in remand  and a few times overnight in jail   been arrested numerous times and acquired a not too shabby criminal record  appeared a few times in the local paper and damaged the reputation of my immensely well respected and truly decent parents and family in the community  been homeless numerous times  been to numerous rehab centers  lived in numerous sober houses  attended numerous 12 step meetings  put myself in numerous situations that defy reason  worked  and quit lost  numerous jobs  wrecked numerous friendships and relationships  and found numerous new awful lows  including diving in numerous dumpsters for bottles and cans  I could not possibly have concieved of when I was 21    Don't make the same mistake I did  Protect and cherish new found sobriety like the precious precious thing that it is  Run with it  Now I can only look back and wonder what my life would have looked liked if I had continued with sobriety at that young age     To end on a positive note though  in 150 plus days of sobriety I have found a great new relationship with a normal sane non addict  gotten a vehicle  improved health and wellness  renewed vitality and interest in Life  started playing the guitar again  mended friendships and relationships  am no longer depressed  anxious or suicidal  and have regained my sanity  I no longer have impaired thinking  By impaired I dont mean drunk but having a completely irrational perspective on life and reality    So that's my story in a nutshell   I hope it resonates on some level and helps   The last thing I would add is in my experience I have never heard an alcoholic or addict say it gets better drinking using or that it gets easier to quit the more times you try or the older you get  Take care    When I first came on SD  I was planning on just quitting for Jan after having a good time on New Years  Then I realized that was stupid and decided to quit before New Years  but still drink at a work dinner in Feb  Then I started reading This Naked Mind  and I'm starting to wonder why I am placing so much importance on my ability to have a glass of wine occasionally  I think I am starting to be okay with never drinking again  If that's what it takes for me to be fully happy and healthy and live my life to the fullest  it's worth it  And that's coming from someone who really really really loves wine  hi dean   i have found that socialization is becoming easier  and something i am actively seeking  it took awhile  no shame in skipping parties in the beginning  or  forever   good luck to you  you will never regret not drinking  Personally  I love kombucha  I don't associate it with alcohol and am very attached to the positive effects on gut flora  which  btw  are increasingly very closely linked to mood and healthy brain "chemistry"  and the B vitamins  I make my own and would suffer far more for further restricting myself unnecessarily than I would from a trace amount of ethanol   Also  if you stick to GT's enlightened  a brand now available in major grocery stores on the US coasts and likely even more widely now  you can guarantee it's under  5   as per FDA regulation  which is on par with a whole range of sauces  condiments  over ripe fruit etc    Can't lick my own balls Good news  I guess this just reinforces that first impressions aren't everything  I hope things keep going well for you  Badass     Keep it going forever now     Didn't know that about N A beers  They don't appeal to me anyways though  Thanks    Happy SOBER '17 too I totally related to "  its  still hard for me to watch others smoke and not feel jealous " That is my ultimate trigger  The fact that other people can enjoy Mary but I can't  I am slowly but surely realizing that is O K  however   I just tell myself that I will stay clean and will end up going farther in life than the people who choose to stay in a state of constant mental fog  I know I shouldn't judge people like that but if it helps me with quitting then oh well  so be it   Congrats on your progress  Very motivating  I just wonder why that is  biologically  Is it because they are malnutritioned  Something different about the brain  It's possible no one's sure why  I'm just curious haha The use of "too" made that very confusing for a second  Nice work  Two days is awesome  I won't drink with you today  I got wasted at a Roger Waters show a few years back  Now I would LOVE to watch it sober   Well  you contribute superbly towards a community that most people would wave away  Anyone who does that has my respect  Ummmm   I think it was from Belle's Tired of Thinking about Drinking  which is subscription based  but I think she has some freebies on her website   I had a killer headache my first week  It might just be your body hating you for a little bit  It sucks  but I found Aleve a little bit helpful  Hoping you feel better soon  My drinking was a lot like yours  I have no off switch  I tried to make rules to control my drinking  but they never worked out  Ultimately I had to accept the fact that no drinks is the right number for me  It was a hard thing to do  but I'm pretty happy having made that decision  Congrats on 6 days  Keep at it  for me it continuously keeps getting better  I'll not drink with you today  Hi BillySami  I won't drink with you today   Don't tease the disease   Ha   Seriously  I find drinking lots of water can help with my headaches  They have gradually subsided    I have pounded down water first thing in the morning and it has helped me so much and continued to hydrate throughout the day   In saying that the headaches I get now compared to the headaches I have had from a hangover don't compare  Hangover headaches felt like a knife was sticking into the side of my head   arghhh  If it's something that worries you  it can't hurt to get it checked by a doctor x Sorry

not here anymore   This resonated with me   Day 1  That's fantastic  Isn't it amazing that you saw a difference in only a week   Another awesome advantage of being sober     Mine was above 200 and now I'm around 120 75ish  Woohoo  Hi Dean       I too am amazed that I have over a month   Turns out if you just don't drink each night  the days just add up   It may not be related to kratom  The swelling must be dealt with as a separate issue imo  Go see an MD ASAP  At least I would  It isn't safe to diagnose something like that yourself and to assume it's due to kratom  It might be totally unrelated  I know   I had to read it several times   Keep meaning to change it but then I get distracted   I got stoned   Took Xanax   Typing is hard  Yeah  I really really love wine too  The taste of it really appeals to me    I'll have to read that book   Yay     At work biking around in the rain  Day 5 i think on suboxone so pretty stoked on that  Not stoked on how i think i finally got myself physically addicted to xanax  Been taking pretty regular for a while always thought i knew when to stop on a binge  Now 12 hours after last dose feel some random anxiety come on that certainly reminds me of typical jonesing  Have just been caving and taking small doses gonna order some diazepam to do real taper  Grateful to not be scrounging around for cash this week and for energy to do other stuff after work other than get high and smoke cigs  Another plus of being off the bth is not smoking hardly at all  Best to all those out there  I drink it often and don't equate it with alcohol  I like the taste  it's low calorie  and the I like that it's a fermented food with beneficial probiotics   I had very bad headaches when I first stopped  I figured it was my brain cells regrowing      It turned out I had a sinus infection  I didn't figure it out until it turned into bronchitis  Thank you for your post   That is an astounding bit of insight into your situation   It's very similar to the whole yo yo experience that came from my dysfunctional relationship with the bottle   with one notable exception   I'm incredibly fortunate to no longer have friends who drink as a sport or pastime  we're all older and pretty much past that    I cannot imagine having that extra component to deal with   I think you deserve kudos for your 2  years where you did deal with it  I would like to share my experience with the meds side of things   About 10 mos ago  I thought I would try meds for the first time in my 50  years on the planet   Unfortunately  they kind of backfired on me with a bunch of side effects that were not good   Fast forward 6 months later  a new doctor  new meds  and no drinking    what a difference it made for me   I don't believe that meds are the answer to all of our life problems   I'm still working on addressing the underlying issues in my life   but this new go round seems to be helping me  One last thought if I'm not gassing on too much here   I tend to look at my life as having been in stages   student  first jobs  first marriage  single again  business owner  married again  father   My relationship with alcohol was different in each stage  as were my friends   It helps me to think of what the next stage of my life will be  my son is all grown up and off to college  and what role I want alcohol to play in that   I came to the conclusion that I couldn't afford the health risks that would eventually catch up with me if I didn't stop  and that I wanted to live life in the world instead of from within a bottle  Whatever you decide for yourself  I hope you won't lose touch with SD   It's a great place to learn and share the highs and lows of the process  I actually look forward to checking my balance now lol    Congrats on 4 months       Congratulations indeed  No more empty calories almost alone makes the pounds melt off right  I know that anxiety all too well  It sucks  Glad you're back Good luck  and glad you're here   Is that how CA Secret Santa works   You send and receive a gift from the same person   Regular reddit gift exchanges don't work like that   If CA Secret Santa is like the rest of reddit  you've left somebody else hanging  not your secret santa    Edit   OP  go find your registration or find the CA Secret Santa admins   You've left somebody else entirely hanging in the wind   Checking in  Another day in the books and all is well  Hi  u thrrrowawaayy   Is this the German guy from NYE or some other bloke  Never hurts to say "I'm sorry  I was drunk and didn't mean it "  Honesty is the best policy w  Doctors  and basically everyone in your life  There's one right next door to my gym   Geesh   The universe can sure test our mettle sometimes   Good luck   Not drinking with you today  Ha  Maybe envisioning something similar  Big revelatory moment  but I still feel afraid  My brother is a big AA guy and I always kind of judged him for it through my pettiness and not wanting to believe I had a problem too   Great Non Drinking Victory   I once allowed myself to watch a few videos on YouTube  which ended in downloading and playing the game again after half a year of abstinence    So  it's not very good  I suppose  Welcome  Hey there lady  Yes I am at 0 4 x7 times a day  I guess I am fearful at this point  I just got here to this level so I think I will give it a few more days at this level and then maybe try jumping  I feel so tired right now  I'm stuck in the house a lot in this cold weather so it is hard to distract  I just need to feel ready I guess to let go   I will not drink today Congratulations  I will not drink with you today  Back from a not very successful moderation attempt   I will not drink today  No  everyone got matched with someone different   Do you listen to recovery podcasts   Recovery Elevator is a great one  and the host has a great piece about naming his addiction "Gary"   Gary tells him all kinds of things  just as you described   a glass of wine doesn't count   etc   Gary  shut your mouth      Sign me up  Thank you  It's a tough process but meditation  therapy  fish oil and antidepressants are helping    Could I moderate myself and drink only 1 or 2  Yes I can  But that obsession would always be there  and I don't like it  By choosing not to drink at all  the obsession is gone and I feel free   Yes   This is me  Love how you put this  I totally get that and used to be that person  What's crazy is now I'm the person being resented by some family with a problem  That being said  it's pretty damn sweet to be the one resented rather than the one resenting because I get to be sober   TBH people who are trying to recruit everyone to AA do annoy me  too  I don't talk about it unless someone wants me to or it's pertinent   I'm so sorry for your loss  Pretty awesome  I might have to try the vape cause it does suck being the odd man out  Hello friend   Congrats on your recent quitting success   I do not want what I'm about to tell you to scare you  I just simply want to be honest and tell you what to expect and I hope it doesn't persuade you to take back up smoking   I had the exact same experience as you  when I quit for the first 2 weeks the only problem I had was random cravings and the occasional headache and was surprised by how easy it was  About week 3 I got hit with a very bad flu  First day of it wasn't so bad  but day 2 and 3 of the flu actually was so bad I had to call in sick too work  Keep in mind when I say bad I mean like  I couldn't work not like I was almost dying   I ended up googling it and found it was quite common and is known as quitters flu and happens to a lot of quitters  It's just the bodies process of detoxing your body  By day 4 of the flu I was right as rain    I've been smoke free for about 2 months now and I feel soooooooooooooooooooooo good  Not only do I physically feel better  No coughing  more energy  not being short of breath all the time  my mental health is also a million times better  I'm not as depressed and feel much more motivated to achieve my dreams   Moral of the story  it sucks but it's worth it    TL DR  I experienced the same thing  about 2 weeks in got really sick with flu like symptoms for a few days  after that I felt right as rain and now at month 2 I feel amazing  Congrats to you too  sign me up Hey mods  can we sticky this post   I'm in the same boat  1 2 drinks most nights  I've been drunk hungover less than the fingers on my hands in the last 5 years   That being said  I love craft beer and all of its novelty  Rather than being addicted to drinking  I'm addicted to the novelty  My wife and I have been through enough arguments about this habit on top of the lack of productivity crappy sleep I get when I drink  It also costs a lot of    that could be better spent elsewhere   I really like the idea of working towards being the best possible version of you  I'm 40 and find it a bit lonely as the sober person   Must be tough at 20   But I think lots of people at lots of ages are wising up   I take the lead on organising sober activities and people do like it   I haven't found my tribe yet  but I think we both will   Giving it time  I hope all goes well at your appointment and congrats on 39 days so far  To question   or not to question  That's the real pickle   Love the phrase noodle up  Thanks    Are there other drinks that have similar benefits without the alcohol   Not drinks but fresh Sauerkraut and Kimchi are fermented with lactobacilli and that process does not produce alcohol at all  They have similarly positive effects on gut flora   Glad to hear it went better   I use an online therapist   and it took me awhile to kind of get a rapport going   I'm glad I stuck it out   Oh wow   That's a huge difference    I'm happy you're so much healthier  If you get overloaded with symptoms then start with the one most hazardous to your life   Good luck  I thought this was gonna be about dicks    Mine went up    I guess I'm a unicorn  Last reading was 145 85  I need to lay off the junk food  Still  not drinking is better than drinking  This was pretty much my situation  I never even dreamed of driving while intoxicated  I was a fun drunk  or so everybody told me  and I never did anything to embarrass myself  I knew my "limits" so I never spent a night puking over the toilet and I was still functioning as a mother and wife just fine  But the fact I hated moving the next morning until I felt better was telling  The fact that it's hard for me to concentrate on my courses is telling  and the fact that I felt shame every morning was telling    Welcome  I'm glad you're here  There should be some links on the sidebar  including timelines  Check out the FAQ  Everyone's withdrawal is a little different  though   Thanks man  Today was my first day of work since I started tapering  I was really concerned with how that would go but I only dosed when I woke up  at half my normal amount  and I've felt much better than I expected  Some lethargy for sure but I've been clear minded and relatively sociable and engaged  edit  and I ATE A FULL LUNCH    I should be totally done tapering by the end of the work week  which will make a wonderful birthday present for myself as it's coming up this weekend   Same with me  I can waste so much money on booze at the bars  not second guess it  then deny myself things that I may need or will last  It's crazy for sure  Better stay away from YouTube for a few days  and forget about Twitch   then just ignore any gaming or gaming related  like gaming PC reviews  VR reviews and other videos of similar fashion   If you get too many videos in recommendations  I would suggest just deleting your channel unless you've uploaded some valuable videos which you don't have on your HDD or wherever else  What does he thinks about you not drinking  Maybe there is something there   and this is why he is choosing to continue to bring alcohol home  I won't drink with you today   My liquor cabinet   bag of beers I most recently purchased from the liquor store  Recently  also  all four of us  sis mom stepdad and I  went out to dinner for my birthday only to discover that my ex best friend of fifteen years  whom I dated for six weeks   who's still on heroin  was on his first night of training as a runner there  This person treated me like dirt  I spent two years  as just friends  helping him get to and from outpatient appointments  offering him moral support an ear or shoulder any time he wanted it  I did briefly directly enable him  but that changed    During my dinner he was passive aggressively rude to our family the entire night  and I ultimately made the choice to throw caution somewhat to the wind and tell the manager that "he is scum" and I did not want my family'a tip money for my birtoday dinner going to him    I don't know if it was the most mature choice but it was my freebie for my birthday  My therapist knows about it and didn't say much about it one way or the other    My sister keeps bringing it up by saying "that doesn't make you assertive but rather is "half way between aggressive and crazy " Free

gone up a bit  I bet there are other health benefits to not drinking  and at the very least your liver thanks you  And I appreciate your point especially that fixing her response is not what's important for my life   Thank you  some pretty good advice  I suppose you're right  the first few weeks is about getting through each day and finding things to occupy you on a day to day basis  I need to take the leap though  Good for you on getting to day 11 as well  thats pretty awesome     Thanks for sharing your story   and I won't drink with you today  Great post   I can't count how many times it "should have been time" for me  Every time I thought I hit bottom I somehow managed to find a new low  Used while pregnant  Check  Lost my kids  Check  Used that as excuse to use more  Check  Homeless  Check  OD'D  Double check  I could go on  but we all know the story   Ultimately though all that matters is that it's time now  Do what you've got to do to get better  if one way doesn't work  try another  I'm sitting here right now with my kids and we're happy   I believe you've got this  Good luck sister   Sounds like a good day to me  I won't drink with you  Your story is awesome   I think I need to start lurking on this sub after work just to reinstate my hope for people     I don't know why I didn't think to go to an AA meeting before  but that's an awesome idea  Now that I think about this     I didn't want a gift because I felt to weird knowing who sent it to me and I travel too much  but I wanted to send one  I didn't think this would result in someone not getting to send a gift because I was on a bender    Guess that ended up being you  Sorry lassy  You should do great  What a birthday present  Life  love  and the pursuit of happiness    without Kratom  That's a BFD  friend  It's more worth it than anything I have ever done  Hopefully  it will be for you  too  Congratulations and keep swinging  You can do this    I always thought he prefers if I don't drink   Just judging by comments he's made in the past   But now I don't know   Many times  if I don't drink for a long time  I become super active and I know that is hard for him because he is overweight and it makes him feel bad   So  now I'm thinking it might have something to do with that    So after writing this i had a large argument with my sisters boyfriend  He was all in our shoes a few years ago  He really wants to help me but when he asked me if i was getting high the last few days  i admitted to him that i did on the specific dates  He went through my phone and saw i was doing things i wasnt supposed to just to get my high  He thinks i was getting high that whole time  Im just feeling like complete shit now that this is all happening   I'm also Irish and had 17 years of drinking and taking drugs  Culture isn't an excuse and when you stop and open yourself up to different ways to socialise  meet people and grow  you will be surprised to see many others in our country are on the same path    This isn't about the environment  it's an inside job within you  We are not victims  I was thinking something similar about myself  that I may be attracted to the chaos that came with my drinking  I suppose in a way I don't like where my life is at  so why not keep it chaotic  But that doesn't fix anything  I'm almost four weeks in and am looking to address some of the deeper issues  I am reading This Naked Mind and that's the point of the book   We have been told in thousands of different ways our whole lives how enjoyable alcohol is which our unconscious mind has absorbed  even though our experience has taught us otherwise   It takes a loooong time and a lot of repetition and mental reframing to get our unconscious mind to not see alcohol as some kind of indulgence or treat   Not sure how long this takes  but you and I are 2 months closer than we used to be      I know that i have a problem  Im trying to fix that  idk if im w ding still but i just feel out of it  Having a lot of issues with my family bc of my addiction  The things ive done to get high  i know i fucked up by getting high but i dont wanna get high anymore and no one wants to believe me bc of my track record  I read something like this in a book  the problem is that we spend too much time listening to ourselves and not enough time talking to ourselves    So when I start having thoughts  I remind myself of what's true and why I started  I hear you  That fear had me crying the last day of my taper  too  Yeah  adjust and do it  I swear pearl  it's worse in our minds  After the taper you have done  this really should be OK  like minimal if any w d symptoms  Hang in there  I could be a bit of a bar fly  Lots of money pissed away  not to mention time and health and energy  Though I get the draw  even if it does not serve me well  Each time you stay away from the bars you add to the victories  Maybe think of what healthy and positive alternates are options for you  Reading all of the post on this sub has really helped me get started and stay motivated  thanks guys  I will not drink today   Hey    Just wanted to see how you were doing today   I'll be around in about two hours if you want to talk     Awesome work on 120  Thanks for the insight  You couldn't be more correct  my friend  It's the craziest thing  Congrats on 35  Thank you for your words    I'm much like where you are right now  unmotivated  pretty hard to remove myself from bed in the morning  but I'm making strides   I think what a lot of people have said here is true  I just need to get rid of the bong and get rid of everything  Or as they say in these parts Fuck the Zero  zero being the number your days sober count returns to when you drink    I too spent 2016 dabbling in sobriety   Ironically  the more I tried to moderate for a while  the worse my binges got   If we learn from our failures  I should be pretty darned smart by now    And may I just add for myself that 2016 was a suck ass year   So with 2017 just starting up  and a few weeks under my belt  I'm going to bravely go where this man has not gone in a long time   Happy to have you along for the sober ride   Congrats on having your first week behind you   that was absolutely the hardest one for me so far  Thank you  I'm going to get rid of it   I need to be strong  and I think if I keep having the reminder of what weed is like it will just make me jump back into full force  One of my favorite quotes from recovery was that when you get addicted you first get addicted physically  then mentally  then spiritually  When you relapse it's the exact opposite  First you relapse spiritually  then mentally  then physically    Don't really know why that stuck with me so much  maybe because looking back every time I relapsed I knew damn well it was going to happen way before it actually did  Anyway  it helps because now I know what to look for before it happens   what works to stop it before it gets there    I wish you the best  it's so much better on the other side  The reason that you need it so bad is indication of addiction  I know it seems like it is not that bad  but think for a moment  If you feel the way you feel and all you wan't is going back and yet no  then this is something to think on  If you are free of it  then it would be as a holiday  You don't drag for it every wake moment    don't you  So why is it that you don't drag for a holiday the same way you do for a weed   Completely agree here  I did not stop because I didn't like it  i really liked it  I stopped because I don't want to be sick  I don't want to smell bad  I want to run  and do so many other things that smoking stopped me from doing comfortably     After 12 years  the other things just kind of won  and I decided I value that more than the smoking  but telling myself that I didn't like smoking would not work as it simply was not true   Congratulations   Keep doing what you're doing  You'll feel great after a haircut  Good on you for taking care of yourself x I will not drink with you today 28 pounds  wow  well done If you mean dreams where you're smoking  yep everyone has them  I even had one recently again and I quit over a year ago  They will slowly go away though  Yes    one night I was on the pooper with the jager sweats     I stood up and next thing I knew I fell flat on my face onto the carpet   good thing the door was open   or I didn't fall backwards    yeah most of us on here are retired from the profession    with Doctorates on getting fuked up    so you know what to do man    just listen to yourself  Hardest one to learn is it's all on you man   there is no super hero coming from the sky or a magic fix    the answer is you   you got this  Go seek the help you need  Wish you the best  I was in the same type of situation not too long ago  Taking it 1 day at a time  I'm on day 5 and I've been using the patch   I haven't had any crazy dreams as a result   But my first night I woke up every hour and a half   I have started removing the patch right before I go to bed   Putting on a new one in the morning has been working out just fine   Props to you  I will not drink with you today x Brain chemistrys are so fickle and unique to each of us  You have a lot of life looking you in the face and that's scary  New baby and family is enough to scare anyone  much less and emerging butterfly     If I were you  just go through the motions  fake it till you make it  I know it doesn't answer all the 'whys' but it's something  for now  Life is going to feel   odd  Takes sometime to figure out how all the pieces fit  You are crushing this thing  A bowl never hurt anyone either  Keep your head up and stay out of it  for now   Give it another week  Proud of you  My wife kept it out of the house for a few weeks  and then would occasionally bring home a bottle of red   I'm okay as long as she either hides or throws away the leftovers on the night she brings it home    I prefer that she pour it down the drain  because I have played the hide and seek game with her bottles before   and I always "win"    Would a setup like that work for you and your hubs  I have heard of that book many times in this sub  Time to check it out for myself  Thank you  Wow  just saw this and wow  That's all I can say  The last 2 months have been challenging but also so liberating and I love reading about the positives of sobriety  Was having a low one this weekend but this really lifted my spirits     raises a seltzer to you  cheers to our freedom     I wish I could tell you how to make things better but all I have is the ability to relate to what you're going through  I too have struggled with bulimia as well as skin picking to relieve anxiety  Try to forgive yourself for yesterday's mistakes and know that 105 lb is not fat  When you get the urge to pull hairs  force yourself to go for a walk  clip nails  maybe even pull out leg hairs instead  All the best  and remember you are not alone in this and that recovery IS possible  It took a while before I became confident not drinking around drinkers when alcohol is being served  It doesn't bother me in the slightest now  Well  that is until the atmosphere changes  then it's time to go     Well eventually I skipped the German party and went to the bad ex  With bad I mean very very toxic  And I love toxic things but this doesn't even have a chance of ending somewhat okay and don't we all love chaos    The phone guy is even more complicated  He asked me if I was drunk yesterday and I kept being vague about it  I know he knows  And I know he knows I didn't cry tonight because I'm sad about ending things between us  but mostly because I'm still a drunk POS    I know he's relieved  His feelings of missing me won't be as large as the feeling he's had for the past two years of him being afraid of me ruining his current relationship   Be extra good to yourself  Rest when u can  eat yummy food  and do things you enjoy that will distract you  I binged a whole season of my favorite show on Netflix in my first couple weeks     Way to go    Thanks for sharing  Glad you're here and all that jazz  Keep it up  I had to quit drinking once I saw it negatively effect my relationship with my wife  I don't want that old life  I want to be present  functional  clear headed so when something does pop up I can take care of it properly   Good luck friend in this new endeavor  I will not drink with you today  I'm very similar to you  Nothing terrible happened  but I drank too much and I knew it    It can be hard to explain to other people why the sudden "drastic" move to no longer drinking    But we know we're doing the right thing   I can respect that  Me too  Getting to two weeks  Struggling with sleep  appetite  temper tantrums and restless legs  The trick is to stay busy  First off  because of not smoking  I have freed up a whole lot of time   time that I would prep to smoke  to score  and then time that I would be spaced out  This can be a problem if you do not have a ready list of things that you can use to fill that time  Paying attention to the anxiety only makes it worse  and any way the anxiety is not real  it is a way to get you back to your comfort zone of smoking up  The hobby and activity tips on this sub are really useful    I frequently contrast my fears  not smoking  with the anxiety I should have experienced earlier   breaking the law  risking my safety and that of others  ruining my health  Not smoking  and anything else that comes from it is nothing compared to that  I guess I wasn't thinking about porn addiction like a "real" addiction  The fact that it's something so many people seem to be able to do without a problem and it's been so pervasive and damaging to my life is a bit surreal to even think about    Also I think this sub is helping  Some other people have pointed it out in various threads  but imo nofap is sort of a shitty sub because the guys there are more doing it because they believe in some broscience about it raising their testosterone levels and think they'll magically start pulling girls  whereas pornfree is more about people actually recognizing they have a problem and wanting to do something to try to fix it  Likewise  and I will not drink today with you  Stupid brains   I'm just the same   Sometimes it kills me how slow my badge counter ticks up   Would somebody at Reddit please double check that it's working properly        I don't have a good answer to your question just yet   I am trying to slowly add more dimensions to my life so that I won't feel like I'm not just sitting here wishing I could drink   I'll be interested in seeing what others say  Wow  look at that cake  congratulations on 36 days    I will not drink today  Me too   Sober me is a ball of anxiety who is often in a bad mood   I had a ton of anxiety in the morning caused by my need for more booze  I would take a Xanax to get me through to 10 am when the local liquor store opened   Once I quit drinking more than 9 months ago I was able to quit the Xanax also   Good luck friend   Oh man  That can be rough  When I quit drinking I lived on a dead end street  and the bar I spent all my time and money at was at the corner  I had no choice but to drive by it every day on my way to work and then on my way home    I'd psych my self up to drive by   Sometimes it took absolutely everything I had to keep driving  id grip my steering wheel as tight as i could  About three weeks into quitting there was a knock at my door  It was the bartender  He wanted to "make sure I was ok" even though he'd see me drive by while he was smoking outside  almost every day  He said "I figured you had the silly idea you COULD stop drinking" and then proceeded to tell me that I was still young  and simply had to "learn how to drink"    He then offered to buy me a shot if I walked down there with him  What a shit show  You can do this  I believe in you   Thanks  I feel like that might be what I need to do  Take care of me so in turn I am happy and healthy and it should then flow on down  in theory    I have also told my kids I need a 5 min break every hour of the day just to be by myself and refresh  hey normal full time employees get breaks don't they  and that seems to be helping with stress levels  I won't drink with you  Enjoy the children  I found the exact quote  it's from Lloyd Jones' book Spiritual Depression     Have you realized that most of your unhappiness in life is due to the fact that you are listening to yourself instead of talking to yourself  Take those thoughts that come to you the moment you wake up in the morning  You have not originated them  but they start talking to you  they bring back the problems of yesterday  etc  Somebody is talking  Who is talking to you  Your self is talking to you  also  incase any of you were wondering   Still going strong  No cannabis for me in 2017 so far        Also  keep in mind that for the past 4 5 years I would take about 10 30 dabs throughout my day normally  So I'm trying to break the muscle memory of spinning my chair to the otherside of the desk and grabbing a rig      Also  I'm only 24  Meaning 25  of my life I've spent dabbing my mind into oblivion  Numb is such an pussy way to live your life   Also when I say everyday  I mean everyday  I see a lot of people saying they took a couple day break here and there  usually  I wish I could say that   But everyday was LungDay at my house  I admire people who have to fight for a good things in life  Makes them stronger and more grounded  Keep shaping your life like a man  I'm at around a hundred days and when you reach the forty to fifty mark you find yourself thinking that you've proved you can do it so maybe the problem you thought you had wasn't really that bad   It was  you've just forgotten how bad it was  also I've found that the changes become more subtle  I'm finding that I don't get as hung up on things and carry them with me  I've got more clarity and worry less about what other people think of me which I never expected   Thank you man  thank you  your kind words really do mean a lot  I'm excited  It's the first time I've been excited about the direction in which my life is headed since    well  honestly  ever  I feel like i've been stagnant since high school and now I actually have motivation to move forward and stop living like this   it's the largest weight being lifted off my chest and it's a feeling greater than any drug  And now I feel like I'm going to start crying at work haha I'm on 7  I so agree with 6 being a bit of a bitch  But today 40  better  That's good progress  We are all here for you  You have this  I won't drink with you today Keep on doing the deal  great start  It took me about 9 months or so to not see alcohol in any kind of positive light   Great start  keep doing the deal  Hah   A fellow Rockstar drinker     I too have gotten in the car ready to cave in  but I've noticed that by the time I get ready and drive the 7 minutes to the store  the craving has mostly past   Now I don't bother to get in the car knowing that the desire to drink will fade   Just think of all the gas I'm saving         Thanks for your comment  I went to the meeting this afternoon  and demographically I was much different than most of the people in the room  I felt really young and like I didn't have the same level of problems with my friend that they had with the alcoholic in their lives   Then I decided that it didn't matter  and I started to listen  And most of the meeting is a blur  but a few things stuck with me  and I am going to go again tomorrow night to a second meeting  They suggested trying six  and I can make that commitment   As for my friend  he told me he would call at five  and didn't respond to a message I sent shortly after  I could get worked up  but if I don't hear anything by six  I'm gonna turn my phone off and go see a movie I've wanted to see  We don't live in the same city anymore  so going with him is not possible right now  but I sent him a list of meetings in the area   now he can decide what he wants to do  Glad to hear your bf is quitting with you  that should help quite a bit  I'll also be making better choices in 2017  partly for the sake of my career  Let's do this  Thank you for doing the Lord's work  I wasn't ready to hear what anyone else had to say when I was just coming out of my reverie  but offering the Big Book or copies of the Grapevine never hurt anyone  Sounds like you had a successful day  Proud of you  I won't drink with you today Meetings should be your  1 priority IMO  Good luck and God speed  Sorry to jump in here  can someone tell me how to get these podcasts on a samsung phone  Is there a good app   I use audible and listen to audiobooks but can't figure out podcasts  I would love to listen to these though  It's been said many a time here  and it's true  it does get a tiny bit easier with each passing day   Sure there are some moments that feel like setbacks  but as long as I don't pick up a bottle I know I'm making progress  You got this  You've got the whole day to spend however you like  I will not drink with you today   Great start  I've been to at least 50 different buildings for meetings and I can tell you that there is every type of meeting  I just roamed until I 'clicked' with one and I've been there for years now  Good luck  That was one of the worst parts for me but they will stop  or at the least  they will stop being so lucid   After 3 weeks or so  they mostly subsided for me   Just have to tough it out for now    In my mind  "liquor store" is just another name for "euthanasia clinic " Alright  I can't even keep up with your menagerie of boy toys  Your going to have to come up with some kind of nicknames for them  Well  didn't you say 2017 was going to be complicated   Thanks  very good advice  Good on you for hitting 2 weeks  stay strong   Awesome quote  thanks for sharing it  Rings true for me definitely  Good job   Wish I was there too   The hardest thing to do is let go   and not be codependent  It sucks watching people lose themselves  but in my experience   AA only worked for me when I wanted it to and did the actual groundwork  I don't know what will be the ticket for your friend  but I'm sorry to hear about the tough spot you're in   Hey fellow designer    I just found this sub and you are totally inspiring me right now  I can totally relate with all of this   Good luck to you  Tomorrow needs to be day 1 for me  The La Croix "curate" flavors are heaven in a can  especially Kiwi Sandia  http   www lacroixwater com category lacroix curate flavors   I feel you  I've got my first star too   Keep up the good work  With fronds like these  who needs anemones  No wait  that's Finding Nemo   Are you me  Same experience  Heh she wasn't working   maybe tomorrow  Housie ordered a mass of sublime food  so ran home early  Now gorged on Peking duck  Yum   Now where's that bottle of Livet     Hey  so I was basically in the same boat as you and though I did move to Sweden halfway through the year I got through the first six months of 2016 sober at home  Similarly enough with the family and every situation being around drink   The truth is at home there's shovel loads of people who don't drink you just don't notice them  There is some folks who are holy joes about it but most sober Irish people blend in   I did check out of the social world in January just to break the cycle but once I started going back out I was surprised at how easy it was to say "not tonight" or "I might have to drive later"  You'll never go to Coppers again but honestly  did you ever really want to do that    Won't say life hasn't changed  won't say I wasn't a recluse at times   will say it's better   Goodness  when did I get so popular  Does it matter if it's cheating  You feel back and you think she would probably be hurt by it  Isn't that all that matters  I just quit Jan 1st  Let's do it together  To each their own  I am almost four years sober and have an NA beer now and again  I can take a sip and dump out the rest if I don't finish   I don't covet it or give it a second thought  I've never seen it as anything other than a drink I like to have when I want to switch up from water  I struggled since old timers talk a lot of shit about NA beers  but fuck 'me  it works if you work it whatever works for you works for you  Thank you I debated heavily whether posting about his passing was appropriate but in the end I decided that because he was a very kind  loving  and generous person that it would be alright  He was a very sweet man and he loved me very much   He will be missed   Thank you for the kind words  I truly appreciate that   I wouldn't mind something like that   These specific times it was very apparent he brought it home for me   Like I said  he doesn't drink very often and he hates the kind of beer I like   I think I just need to talk to him about it again     With no major Holidays coming up I think you can smooth into the Spring   I found  for me  things got much easier after about 100 days   The habit had taken hold by then  There are Refuge Recovery phone meetings and Iive streamed meetings through a site app called "in the rooms" if you haven't checked them out yet   I just have to keep going until I hit that groove  I guess  Thanks for the insight and congrats on 367  I will not drink today  Thank you so much  I really appreciate it   GET SMASHED BRO  Oh wait  that doesn't work anymore    GET TACOS  thanks for the reply bro  I think I will reward myself with a snack or maybe even some programming  I might watch some youtube videos before I go to bed but I think that's not a very good idea because I might get addicted  However  I think I can just browse all things related to programming as that is one of my favorite things to do  Isn't acetone breath the result of ketosis  you will literally be pissing 2 5 years down the drain   Don't do it     Yet   Checking in  I will not drink today  I will not drink today  Almost a month now  the days just keep adding up as I choose not to drink one day at a time   Is this what you are talking about   https   www reddit com r stopdrinking comments 2sf5jm my attempt at an alcohol recovery timeline   I lurk this sub every single day  CA raised by CAs  Tried and true  Not much on here I can't relate to and the amount of camaraderie in here is honestly almost unparalleled   The ecosystem this sub has created is really fucking fascinating to me   With that being said   god DAMN if this sub doesn't attract a lot of whiners and people seeking sympathy  So much of it is "Oh woe is me  I fucked up again and I will just never get on track"  As someone who is high functioning it gets really annoying and old to see people constantly feeling so sorry for themselves in this sub    Success stories are usually something along the lines of "didn't shit my bed" or "SO didn't divorce me today"  And fuck me if someone else talks about being embarrassed when the liquor store clerk knows them on a first name basis  Who fucking cares if they recognize you  They work at a liquor store   chances are they've got more to worry about then your addiction and persistent patronage    It is so rare to see someone who is actually kicking ass in life and still dealing with hardcore alcoholism  Hell  it's rare to see someone doing ANYTHING with their lives in this sub  It's like the most pathetic AA dropouts came here to trade sob stories and that's 99  of what you see on here    You never hear "I have been on a two week bender but showed up to work today and closed a  150k Deal  Taking my commission check to the bar now"  For the most part  half the active posters in here can barely handle basic hygiene    That's probably the number one reason I lurk instead of posting  In this sea of people who literally do the bare minimum to exist   there seem to be so few high functioning CAs  Which is probably why you are all so insular   You're not weak or dumb  You're a human with an addiction  Hell  I have trouble sometimes when I'm playing Fallout and I have my character drink alcohol  temporary strength boost  and I hear the bottle cap sound   Yes it will be  Just won't be until january 15th until it will all collapse  which is two more weeks than expected    My guys come in waves though  I have 2 or 3 months where I'm juggling them and there are month's where I'm not talking to anybody    I was thinking about nicknames already  But I wasn't able to come up with more than just initials  I can spent the time before I'll pass out to make something up though  Chances being very high I won't be able to remember them tomorrow and have to come up with something else   Sounds like you are on your way      Also  did not receive any match  left nobody hanging   Assumed the person who organized it was on a bender and fucked it all up for everyone  Any Extensions for safari  You may be referring to the timeline linked in the faq   https   www reddit com r stopdrinking wiki index wiki how long until    I use to love the using dreams  i would often fantasise about using successfully and controlling my habit during the day and at night I would get these intense using dreams  almost always turning out bad  It would be a great reminder that I can't control my habit    I think it depends how much you smoked  I smoked 4 7 grams a day for a good 7 years and the dreams went on for months almost nightly  9 months later I still randomly get a dream at times   Now at 14  months I haven't had a using dream for    ages   This is exactly what I did I believe you heard this in Allen Carr's book  The Easy Way to Stop Smoking   Its a great read listen  if you prefer audiobooks  I used the patch 5 or 6 years ago  The dreams were exhausting    After almost a week on the patch I forgot to put one back on after showering and went to work that way  I made it through that day  and so went for another  and ultimately made it a month before I saw some coworkers smoking  bummed one and went right back to my habit   So the patch helped with putting down the cigarettes  but patch or pills or whatever  the only way to stay smoke free is to never light up again   Btw  I'm using Chantix this time    You forgot my story about     Something  Dang  I wasn't even that fucked up  Too lazy to check the comments  Cheers   Same here in The Witcher 3 only it's the "glug  glug  glug"  I'm about ready to do your portrait  Well done friend  sounds like you are on the right track  You have some choices in terms of treating heroin addiction  I would strongly recommend you look for a professional in your area to talk though them  I am guessing you do not have much cash as most of us do not when we have a habit but this is not always the case  If you are low on funds  try asking around or google low cost drug services  If you have insurance check to see what that covers but if you could get to an addiction service it would really help figure out the right road for you  Main options are substitution treatment or detox  Substitution type treatment would mean stabilizing using methadone or suboxone and slowing reducing to being clean  The other main option is detox  and again there are options such as community detox  at your home or a place you choose   The other detox is in house detox in a facility  Again this very much depends on personal circumstance and is best worked out with a professional  After the "phsyical" part if you like you then have options on rehabilitation  Residential rehab is an option and a good one if it is available to you  The other option would be 1 1 counselling  Both can be used in combination with support groups such as Narcotics Anonymous or SMART recovery  Not to confuse you but even withdrawals are tough  the first year can be a little dark  malaise  but the pay off is huge     When I control it I don't enjoy it and when I enjoy it I don't control it     This right here is gold  Good on you mate    I'm 14 months sober and I still find myself coming here just to be reminded of what its like  stories like yours remind me if I have that one it's going to start the circle of madness again   It's great you are tackling the problem so early before wasting a decade on the stuff   Stay strong mate  A relapse is only a hurdle in the road to recovery  I had to walk by a room  Dark and falling apart like in silent hill  I COULD feel evil coming out of it  There were two old dead people ghosts and they were evil and invisible   but I knew they were there  I don't know why  but it was really must walk by  I was afraid     that was a bad bad nightmare   Lesson well learned   I noticed the same exhausting effect in the days after I allowed myself even 1 drink   I tried telling myself one and done  now I know that for me none and done is far easier and better  I broke my "friends telling you to go to rehab" cherry today  I am truly pleasantly surprised that this sub is moderated at all Thanks for the reply  And yes this time    Oh I love Peking Duck  You are right   Just don't call the German dude  Adolf  Toxic Guy and Phone Guy are perfectly acceptable  You're not alone  I worry most about my sobriety around family   maybe a bit too intense for me but I like your idea of scheduling  Luckily for me  this was vacation and there was no work i had to worry about  I mean i have a long term project due in a couple days that is hard but it is ok   It's Wednesday here  but I'm in  I will not drink today  Fuckin boozebag    No problem  I have a long looong way to go but it's about progress not perfection  I hope that you can fnd what you need as well  I am a frequenter of  r luciddreaming and I used to be able to control my dreams  It's very difficult to do and you have to train yourself to do it  You can't expect it to just happen  You have to train yourself  in waking life  to  throughout the day  continuously asking yourself "Is this a dream " so that when you actually are dreaming it will be second nature for you to question "Is this a dream " But just asking this question isn't good enough  You need to look for queues in the dream world  which you will also have to do in the real world   Such as  flicking light switches  lights don't seem to work properly in dreams  Same with text  look at text  text in dreams is usually garbled and doesn't make sense and is illegible    Lucid dreaming is probably one of the greatest experiences I've ever had and would highly recommend it to everyone  but it is by no means easy to achieve   Yes  I see  I guess for me everything is kind of addictive  even food  yet im not out of shape   So  i will try to get myself addicted to programming  For me I tried moderation too  I found that sometimes  but not all the time  I could have only one or two    But it's like I've done too much physical body damage from the times I couldn't control it    I had hangover like symptoms after only 2 beers  while sobering up while awake  I used to drink until sleep every day of the week when it was at its worst   Like I didn't get drunk  at all  but felt anxious  fidgety  shaky  a general uneasiness I didn't like     Depending on where you're at and how long you've been drinking or abusing  you may or may not experience this  but it is your decision and right to find out    TLDR  Found the times that I could moderate  it still felt like shit  I've seen a season or two   It gets uncomfortable for me when I see what could happen if I let myself get too far out there   All the more reason to stick to the sober road  But but but  German guy is the only one that's not That toxic  Isn't it about time to do some damage control  Thanks  I like this quote too  I've never thought of it as a spiritual addiction but it really does become intertwined with the soul after using for so long  Definitely not a high functioning CA   I was so great when I was a stoner though    Trying to just get back to that   I do know of some though   And I'm getting better   And having a lot of fun   I haven't seen many HF CAs last though   There was a doctor in my small town growing up   But it was different back then  You can pry my shitposts out of my cold dead fingers Your mind is trying to scare you back in numbing it  Dreams are there to unwind your sub thoughts and emotions  This is called bringing them to light  Eventually you will get better  I always have nightmares when I go sober and confront my pain in life      the reason I'm able to stick with it is because I am developing the skills to deal with my problems without leaning on alcohol   I think this is key to staying on track   I'm still have much to learn  but that's the approach I'm taking as well   Congrats and happy to sober with you today  Thank you  I didn't    Sometimes I don't know how I'm going to go the rest of my life like this  I've got a ball of tension in my chest all the time  it never goes away  The only thing guaranteed to make it go away is getting drunk  It's not like being sober has made me a better person  And I'm still a shitty person  just with fewer outbursts and arrests   I don't know how I could tell someone newly sober that it gets easier   Anyway thanks  And I'm sorry for the melodramatic post  I've quit before and relapsed after years of not smoking  I'm getting myself motivated to quit again  On this sub right now for inspiration   The gum has helped me in the past  Sure  it's keeping nicotine in my body  but it's helped to break the habit  the ritual of actually smoking without suffering withdrawal at the same time    Last time I used gum regularly for the first couple of weeks and then I phased out of it without much thought or effort  I just naturally went longer and longer without gum until I didn't want it at all  It's easier for me if I first just get out of the ritual and detach from smoking   I take a work break and smoke  I light up a cigarette on my drive to work  I smoke when I get settled in at home  I smoke after a meal  Lots of things are triggering  so I use gum to at first to get through the day without suffering a sort of double loss   Also  I replaced smoking with walking  Smoke breaks at work we're replaced with a 10 minute walk  Instead of smoking while drinking coffee in the morning  I'd make my coffee to go and go for a brisk walk  I like to go out for a couple of beers quite regularly  Instead of smoking outside between the two beers  I'd cash out and walk about a mile to another place for the second beer  then walk home   I live in the city  so lots of things to walk to   Replacing a bad habit with a good habit is never a bad thing   In a similar fashion  I know several people who became obsessed with the gym in exchange for quitting drinking  It's something to do besides go to bars   So  gum for a while  but ultimately  taking several short walks each day replaces smoking for me  We got this  Thank you sweetie  I will jump soon I promise   You went to the neighbors and were drunk and he had edibles and you took THC pills and puked all over everything when you got home   Or something like that  You're on a private sub Jax started and you dont even know who the fuck she is Thanks so much for your reply  I really appreciate the insight about life in stages  I'm having a really tough transition over the last few years  and I think I need to get out of school and start a new job to really refresh myself  I'm miserable in grad school and working for the university  definitely need to find a space where I feel worthwhile since I really like to be productive    I'll stick around  One of the main things that held me back from drinking was not being a part of this community anymore  It's been a lifesaver for me on so many levels  and I think right now I need it right now before I go on a really scary bender   Thank you very much for your supporting and kind words   I wish you the very best too  Oops  Extra comma    I meant  Don't call the German dude "Adolf"   not  Don't call the German dude  Adolf         Oh but my hygiene is impeccable  I'm about 5 weeks in and I already noticed a pretty significant increase in volume  and how easy I get and maintain an erection   Maybe I'm lucky with this  But does it matter if it takes a month or a year  Eventually we'll overcome this and feel better for it the rest of our lives    I've noticed two groups posting here that I think are related   1  all the just starting out folks  and 2  the folks with just around a year   like yourself   Coincidence   I think not   Hope all the newbies will be flooding this sub a year from now with their success stories  Definitely  I made a lot of changes that has resulted in me not having a seizure in over a year now  From having 5 in a year  it's quite the difference    I will forgive myself for the silly indulgence and am grateful I was ok and had no repercussions   Thank you Tonight  I'm going to go home eat some home cooked food  and watch some netflix  Way to stay honest  Pick yourself up  dust yourself off  and try again  A relapse or slip can be helpful if you know why it happened and you change because of it  Best wishes  Anxiety is something a ton of us understand   It goes hand in hand with problem drinking   Drinking isn't all bad  it  does  relax me and it  does  remove my anxiety   But guess what  it's a lie   It removes it only to let it come back stronger as soon as the alcohol leaves   I won't lie and say I'm totally anxiety free now that I'm sober   I still get panic frequently  But it's a different quality   It's no where near as intense as when I was drinking   I also still wake in the middle of the night  but peacefully read a bit then sleep  instead of lie awake hating myself and fretting over stupid drunk things I did   And I have a better handle over the anxiety   Because I'm emotionally sober I can recognize and deal with it instead of letting the anxiety rule me   I'm still in bad moods  but so is every other fucker on the planet    Welcome to world  Take that time and think about your life  Alone time is nothing to be afraid of  You can always stay at my dad's house with me     P The student stage can be really conducive to the drinking habit  It keeps you in the company of a lot of folks who haven't quite taken that next step of a full time job and maybe a mortgage and or kid   From all that you've written I genuinely believe that you can do this thing   No bender required   Just make it through the end of this day   Rinse  repeat     I hear you  I have a son with special needs who is focused on recycling  Talk about shame having my sweet boy dragging the BARREL chock full of bottles  He is not the reason I drink  long line of Irish drunks    The question is  how good is the bait   Can you imagine   The concept of not drinking simply did not exist in my brain at 22    Thank you   Welcome   I won't drink with you today     I've had Peking duck in Beijing actually  or is that Beijing duck then   paying attention to how much my bf or friends were drinking so I  could try not to seem too excessive by comparison  And carefully saving the last of your drink so you can finish it at the same time and get a new one the second it's empty  The first bit of days passed  And I see days getting a little harder by evening but every happier not to have drink the night before  So cheking in because good or bad I wont drink today with u SD    It's not new  I have benign positional vertigo  It comes and goes as it pleases  Usually every 6 9 months I'll have a mild bout for a few days  Last few days has been pretty severe  it could just be coincidental but just wanted to check in   I started smoking pretty heavily once I got to college  and after multiple quarters of my grades not being where I wanted them to be  I knew I had to quit  I tried cutting back at first  which I learned really quickly was impossible for me to do  I realized that more than anything I had simply gotten into the habit of smoking as opposed to using it for medical purposes or for fun  A couple of my friends had vapes which they used to try and not smoke cigarettes as much  If I was in a room full of people smoking  I live in my fraternity house so that happened at a rate I'm not necessarily proud of   I always felt the need to smoke for the sake of smoking  Instead I began borrowing my friends vapes when I was there  and it did help me stop smoking weed  However  the head rush from the nicotine was enjoyable enough where I am still vaping even tho I have stopped smoking weed  I think that a vape can definitely help in quitting weed  however you should be careful and try to avoid vaping with nicotine as I've found that to be the more difficult substance to quit now  The act of vaping did replace the act of smoking for me however  so as long as you don't fall into the nicotine trap  I think it can help replace the habit of smoking something and could be useful for you in quitting  I wish you all the best in stopping smoking  as it really is for the better    happy new year and good luck to you  Yeah  it was not fun  I'll give it another 24 hours to see if it chills before I see Dr  Thanks for your input  My grocery store has a full sized liquor store INSIDE it right next to where you walk in  The other corner has an enormous wine section  And finally there is an entire aisle dedicated to beer  On top of that they play wine commercials over the store wide speakers and give out samples of wine  During the holidays they were giving out samples of Kahla  The drive that you need now is simply the truth that you need one in order to get to where you want to be   Guilty pleasures  She accidentally ordered two entire ducks   quite an expensive order   and she's not even a CA  Norms fuckup too  Congrats on the new treadmill  It's nice to have something to do if you ever feel bored   This resonates with me hugely  Great post  I was driving back up to where I live earlier  Bout a 3 hr drive  I kept going back over and over the last week of Christmas holidays and the excess drinking  And I mean over and over to try and figure out if I might have said done something stupid  etc  And I thought even in the fact of me having to replay over and over this analysis  that answers it in itself    I feel guilty again for the millionth time in the past 2 years or so  of my many attempts to get sober  that I wasn't fully there and present with my family and friends    Towards the end of the week  it turned into a 3 day bender  The worst 2 night of sleep followed with extreme depression    Turns out drinking  wheter is was just blackout drinking or trying to moderate  is a way to big hassle for me  All the planning and thinking  when  where  how much etc  is exhausting  Quitting it all together and not having to think about it at all is easier  if you learn to cope with it    Also I realised I'd never be truly happy if I continued drinking  Every grocery store in New Hampshire sells beer  Gas stations too  Pretty much everywhere  I'm lucky I don't live there anymore  I like it   there's so many flavors  Cayenne is delicious and healthy      You aren't depressed  You are just pissed  I get it  And also  fuck you  I said it  Fuck you  You think you're shit  You think you are inferior  Wrong  You are fucking retarded if you think that  Wake up  Wake the fuck up  What the fuck is the point of all the work your parents and teachers  all the food bought for you  all everything if you just say "I'm depressed  oh im inferior" FUCK THAT  You are gonna let some bullshit idea that you are inferior to hold you back  You think you need my fucking help  Well guess what  You know why you keep fucking up  You know why there are those billionaires out there and you aren't one of them  It's because they are special  Nope  Not at all  They went through the same shit you went through  Some worse even  Some people had to deal with your shit   but not even have a guaranteed meal  So  what are you going to do  be pathetic  Believe you are not smart  Not talented  not good  and all that bullshit  Or are you going to become the best you can be  For all I care  you don't do shit  But  if you want to look in the mirror everyday and see a waste  then go for it  But if you want to try  then you will at least have the courage to look at yourself  Then you have to beat yourself  You have to prove yourself wrong  You have to prove everyone else wrong  I mean  you don't have a fucking choice  Little shit  First time out for dinner with people drinking  I feel like i got this but wish me luck   My guys always go through waves too and it seems like I'm always juggling a couple   I have to come up with nicknames to keep them straight   Hot Cop  Emotional FA  controlling hot ex    Sometimes it's names I give them in here and sometimes it's just in my head   Currently I have hot fisherman and hairy man  The trick is to first put both feet behind your head   That's such a great fail   I'm so hungry right now  Good luck  you can do this    Hi there and welcome   You'll find some pretty awesome folks here willing to answer your questions and hold you up when you're about to fall  It's been a lifesaver for me  Hope you stick around   I won't drink with you today     I love this  it really resonated with me today  approaching my 40th bday  Thank you  I will not drink with you today   Right on  man  Well done  I'm at two  and I can say with confidence I will never smoke again  Thanks guys  only on day 3 and I've been having crazy anxiety attacks and almost ran out for a drink last night  This reminded me to tough it out  We can do it  This year we will both quit and stick to it That is such an amazing and kind gesture  I hope you choose life too  op  Thank you for sharing this is the most extreme case of being pressured to drink I have ever heard  What chance do we have if the bartenders start hunting us down   Could you recommend any other good podcasts on sobriety alcoholism  I am eager to listen  Thanks  And congrats to OP  This   Exactly  I'd rather not drink at all than have just one and then stop  Stopping at one or two just flat out SUUUCKS  Give me all the alcohol or give me nothing   I will not drink today  Try pocket casts  You can also use Google play music  Fuck knows  Should know given that we probably named them  Very tasty  Thanks for the insight There is a sub that can give you some support  I've heard that people find it helpful but I've never been there  r opiatesrecovery  Good luck  kicking dope is horrible and staying clean is really hard  It gets better so hang in there I don't consume anything containing alcohol  My respect for this drug is profound and i protect myself  It almost destroyed my life  I don't mess with it   I came back to add I think you have to have the doc approval for the breathing treatments  but they help me to calm down and sleep when I'm freaking out   Probably not something you'd think of but I found them to to help calming down  Yes it is worth it Yes it is worth it I will join you in not drinking today   Awesome  Congrats on day 10 dude  A great start  I understand where youre coming from  Not in any bands at the moment but used to be  Still a big metalhead though  Beer and whiskey soaked shenanigans seem to go hand and hand with that lifestyle  Stay strong  Keep posting and check out the chat  It helped me to have a support group where there were others who wanted to stop drinking  Eventually  I made some good friends  too   It would have been unseemly to ask the bill  but it has to be at least 40   50 colonials   Nice treat  shall leave her a twenty out in the morning  I read Whyquit com and Allan Carr's book    Both helped  It was rough watching him fall off the deep end early on when he broke and started drinking heavy everyday  I cant lie  I felt pretty uncomfortable because it reminded me of me drinking  Really liked the movie though  PTI in NJ  I have that coming up for my poss  Felony I got in April  Took them long enough  They are fine with you being on subs  My friend who gave me the idea and grabbed me the TFV8 CloudBeast by Smok gave me 4 5 flavours with 0nic in them  Awesome  man    I hope you have a good year too  man  Kill it this semester in school  You deserve it  Thanks  I'm looking forward to breaking 120  which is what I hit before I really realized that I need to stop drinking entirely rather than just take an extended break   I bet it was amazing   And now tomorrow I have to go get duck  So many thousands of calories  Thank you    Sadly  no  She has to be ready  Good luck to you  I knew at 22  too  I wish I had your drive to change back then  One day at a time seems to be working for me  as well as the support of SD  but it took me a lot longer to accept that I  too  hate drunk me  Welcome to this great group   He's channeling the living shit out of SDK    Praying is 100  right   And I can speak as someone who is almost 7 months clean   You won't believe how good you end up feeling   It drags on to the point where you kinda get used to it and then the clouds part   sun shines     hang in there  it's coming   The momentum builds up  You're doing great   I agree  Inpatient was a great experience and laid the groundwork for a lifetime of recovery   These incidents rarely happen in a vacuum  I learned when doing the steps that a lot of the times people were rude to me  they often had reason to be because of my previous behavior  not necessarily what I was doing in the moment     Often the best thing to say is nothing    If you enjoy the drama  keep doing what you are doing   If you want it to stop  Alanon can help    Just when I felt I had to step in and be a voice of reason     Smokey is hitting it on all cylinders this week  It's like I can take a week away and know that Ricky won't totally fuck the store    Damn girl  Preach   Thanks for this  I spent yesterday dwelling on the past and this is yet another wonderful reminder that I still have many years ahead to make fantastic sober memories  And I know I checked in earlier but I'm gonna go ahead and do it again  Lol  Not drinking with you today   Two weeks in  Spent a lot of that time experiencing crazy mood swings  some cripplingly depressing  No easy way out but it will pass and you'll feel so good about yourself  Stay the course  Yes  Don't forget that a 4th step inventory should also include positive traits  aptitudes  and virtues  A thorough inventory should not be only negatives    I think this statement you ask about simply means that each person is unique  It is a kind of warning about being too brief and encouragement to be as thorough as possible at the time of writing   You're dangerously flirting with losing your CA Union Card  Verbs and "healthy options   "  Thems normie words   Got 'er fellas  Hah  this is fantastic  This  So this  I've also realized that although not as confident when sober  I am MUCH more likable and pleasant to be around  People generally like people who are anxious and fidgety more than people who are obnoxious and intoxicated  Quitting has also given me the opportunity to work on being that happy  sociable person without booze  which is a much more fulfilling feeling   Good news for VPoison  bad news for duck   It's hard to cook  either always too fatty or oily  Don't know how those takeaway technicians do it so well  Ahh yes   the microwave  The Bubble Hour  Since Right Now  That Sober Guy  Home  etc  I just googled "recovery podcasts" and started clicking around   There are lots  Give your self a good night cry   Thank you  There is a meeting nearby in a few days I'll see about going along and exploring your suggestions    That's amazing  It is exciting and a 'whole new world'  I wasn't excited about much either until I saw the end in sight  Now  everyday is exciting and new  You are almost there  Crying is OK  helps alot really  I nevered cried on Kratom  rarely  You gotta feel shit to cry  ya know  Keep your head up  Keep checking in  Awesome  Such a great feeling    I got home at midnight from work last night  thought to myself  lets be a little cheeky  I ate a bowel of dorritos with some spicy salsa  Hahaha  was awesome  The anxiety is the main reason I'm quitting  I will not drink with you   How long is the funnel for such a procedure  Just asking for science  never seen an enema before  Well  that was quick  take me out  Probably on average 5 drinks a day  So not "wreck my life today" amounts  but still too much  I was sober for a year and a half at one point and I felt much healthier  I've been focusing on some mental health stuff first I guess though  Thank you  How long is the funnel for such a procedure  Just asking for science  never seen an enema before  Not having structure is the hardest obstacle to overcome while quitting  School professional development work friends and family can help fill that void in your time  Well  that was quick  Take me out  thanks my friend is know to be a troll with everyone that talks to me im didnt talk to   he that im doing pornfree  im should have expected that thanks everyone    Checking in  still clean  Was very tempted to find pictures to look at today  I've had some kind of cold from hell  strep throat or something for the past week  Shits going around right now    my guess is you've caught something  Try and take it easy  thanks and congrats on 38 days     Telling myself that I mostly didn't like smoking helped because it's true  I would enjoy maybe 3 cigarettes per day  The other 17 I smoked purely because I was an addict  I didn't enjoy them and they cost too much in terms of    stress and the overall effect on my health   If I could only ever smoke 2 3 cigs a day I would  but I have to treat smokes like an alcoholic treats booze  not one drop  If I smoked one tomorrow I would be back to a pack a day by Friday   Your username kind of drops you in it  Oh request a badge  Such a small thing  but such a reward to see those days go up  And a bike  wow  that's almost like getting a new car  So many adventures it can take you on  I will not drink today  I have that hope for them too  posted  I hope I nailed it    Its raw   Just sell it on craigslist and buy a laptop  You might lose some cost from depreciation but what you will gain in mental health  focus on fitness  school etc   anything to progress yourself  is nothing  The benefits are waiting for you  Bite the bullet  Sell it  Buy a laptop and remove that bad choice from even being considered when you are at a weak point  I have also came across the same decision  Laptop instead of a game capable desktop  The fact that you thought about it makes you capable of doing it and making great progress  Comin' Down Again   Rolling Stones  It's my detox anthem   No drinking for me today   I will eat Chinese food and not drink today  I'm right there with you  buddy  I'm clean  but my life got so messed up before getting clean that I am dealing with that now  along with the mental fuckjob of PAWS  It is hard  but it will be worth it  Life hits us all really hard sometimes  and having this addiction hanging over us makes it exponentially harder  A month or month and a half of feeling shitty is nothing compared to living a full life for decades without kratom  Great decision   You can do it  You're right lol but the struggle is real  Thank you Ohh have a hug  I'll pour one out  I'm so sorry for your loss   I just wanted to let you know that you're not alone in what you're feeling   A little over four years ago  I lost my best childhood friend   He died at the age of 26 due to organ failure brought on by Cirrhosis of the liver   It's going to be a rough go for a while  but it's okay to grieve   Give yourself permission to cry and to feel her loss deeply   This will help you down the road   When my friend died  I saw an opportunity   It was an opportunity to make something meaningful and positive out of such a shitty situation   It was an opportunity to honor him and his memory   It was an opportunity to choose life over death   And that's exactly what I did    I used his passing as an opportunity to get sober   I quit drinking entirely  I haven't had a drink in over four years   and it's been one of the best decisions I've ever made   He wasn't able to beat alcohol  but I thought  "Maybe I can do it for him "  When I told my friend's mom the story of how his passing helped me get sober  she gave me the biggest hug as tears ran down her face    It was pretty incredible to be able to share that with her  and to show her that love triumphs over grief  that meaning and purpose can beat out cynical nihilism  and that  if only for a short period of time  life can beat out death   I'm so sorry that you're going through this  but you can make something positive out of this   You can do it  but you have to make that decision   I believe in you  I would like to stay away as much as possible  I just don't want to be wasted  fog headed  and shitty anymore  I dont want to have alcohol rule my moves  Id been drinking before things that made me feel uncomfortable  I need to face my fears  i suppose  Great job   I'm working on day one and came straight home   It's a good feeling  I appreciate this response and support so much  Thank you thank you  I will not drink today   Fatigue was by far the most brutal part for me  Good news is that it was basically gone by day 35  By day 22 it became much easier  Keep grinding and believe or not you will soon be there  By week two I was hating life because of the fatigue  It was exactly like you explain    to fucking tired to even wanna engage my brain enough to speak  Typing out a simple message on here was a full blown chore  Good luck  Addiction recovery is profitable and there's a low barrier to entry  There is a lot of competition  Addiction as a profit center runs deeper than most would believe  For example  a large percentage of the alleged "personal" recovery blogs are created and maintained by a rehab facility   The only 24 hour hotlines that won't be scammy are those associated with AA  People volunteer to take calls   whatnot as a service commitment  I'm not sure how to find them  someone involved with AA may be able to point you in that direction  Your state or county  if in US  may have non scammy resources available  but probably only during normal business hours   I make a mean duck   Whether whole or just the breast    Gotta keep it up on a rack so it's not swimming in fat   Score the skin   gotta have crispy skin  Not an idiot at all  just young  If you can't go without one for a week  you're screwed  Quitting is going to be one of the hardest things you'll ever do   in your entire your life  I say this not to discourage you  but to express the seriousness of toying with such a fucked up drug that's brought so much sadness to millions of victims and families    Take it from a guy who had similarly naive thoughts in my freshman year  That was 1989 and I'm just quitting now  Ask over in  r alanon they should be able to help  I keep seeing this book brought up  it's probably a stupid question but does it really help out  I'm starting to believe as much as I'm seeing it mentioned that I've missed out on a valuable secret  Your TL DR is an excellent precept and definition     But now I don't feel loved or even safe around him    This is more often than not how it feels to be in a relationship with an alcoholic  What will you be waiting for since he isn't interesting in changing  He doesn't want help  but you can get help by going to Alanon meetings  They helped me cope with the alcoholism of a loved one    Trying to have a rational conversation about something that happened when your boyfriend was drinking is a waste of time  He will never see things the way you do  nor be willing to take responsibility    Were you "right to walk away"  I don't know if it's a matter of right or wrong  For your own mental health  safety  and happiness  however  it sounds like a wise choice    Alanon meetings are almost everywhere  Congratulations  I won't drink with you today  Hey I pay my union dues here fucker     Still a girl's gotta look good   This takes work when you keep accidentally drinking handles of vodka every week   That's a lot of fucking calories  u werunfromcops       No      No    no    I'm actually in the Netherlands right now  so we're not even that far apart  The old man used to show me the original trilogy when I was a lil' shit  faffing about with lego's  I was that one kid with the PS1 while all the other kids had PS2s  y'know  But I never minded  Fuck  I had Wipeout 3  I was perfectly happy with that  Never asked much and all that    I still  to date  have that same PS laying around  now that I think about it  It's long dead  like my childhood innocence the moment I found out about the internet and what gems it holds when it comes to the exploration of the opposite sex  but still  it's a bit of old nostalgia I hold on to  Awesome  Oh  by the way I just noticed its  30 000 for the stay  Yikes  True   which why I now feel like a glutton and will have to add more miles onto tomorrows hike  Pah  couple of hours worth of scotch to get through  quick nap and back at it  I think this is fear talking  and causing you to make excuses for why you should just smoke a little bit  The fact that you've been trying since december is why the whole "taper off" thing doesn't work  At what point do you stop tapering  That's the thing  it never really ends  Cold turkey is hard because you're building discipline and not giving yourself the easy way out anymore  You're stopping a longtime habit  and that will never be an easy thing  for anybody  If you could just smoke every once in a while and be ok  you wouldn't be where you are right now   This was so insightful  I'm on day 3 and am looking forward to reuniting with sober me   Go big on the 1st time is what I've always heard It helped me cue into some of my thought processes and reasoning tactics  read  excuses for not quitting   that I hadnt even realized I was doing   It was also a relief to know that what I was experiencing wasn't unique to just me  I would definitely give it a read  he is very rational and logical about the whole thing and even says to continue smoking until you finish reading the book  Thank you all so much for the feedback   What a great resource this place is  Thought I could  Came back to sobriety every time  sometimes after long painful months long binges   I'm here 3 days sober after NYE asking the same question  maybe it's the same situation as your own  I don't think it will be possible  I don't think I'd be asking the question if I didn't have a problem  Moderation would just be "normal" and my life would continue   And I'm just getting my feet wet in this whole sobriety community  I feel like I've just awoken to this issue  It's a lot of cognitive dissonance  Why do I think I still need to consume alcohol at all  Is it that I genuinely like a good red wine or beer  or is it that I need an excuse to prove to myself that I don't have a problem  Is it years of associating intoxication with these flavors that I like   Why can't I admit that I have a problem  Do I fear the labels of "alcoholism" and "addiction" and "sobriety" that much  If labels are scary  just ask yourself if alcohol results in a net detriment to your life  then cast it out entirely    Best of luck man  I just feel like moderation with our problem is too much work  We do but it wouldn't be hard to at least talk about   I assume you are talking about an albuterol treatment   The only thing that mighty concern me with that would be if the patient's heart rate is already high  because albuterol could make it higher   It's definitely worth talking to them about if they are anxious though   it's something to try and then we know if it helps   Thank you  At about 2 weeks you'll be ok  Just get to that point and you'll feel things start to normalize   In the meantime  go easy on yourself  Drink some tea  read a book or watch a movie that you enjoy  The last thing you should do is start getting hard on yourself because of how you feel  This is your body recalibrating so it's gonna be a roller coaster for a bit  Don't give up  Thank you for sharing your story  You managed to defeat so many obstacles and I am confident you will do it again with gaming  It's a long battle that needs to be fought  but trust me  the reward is so satisfying at the end    Good luck mate  If you're really done then it's time to put in a lot of effort to figure out what works for you to keep you from going back 2 using again  I believe it's different for everybody  Luckily today there is a plethora of information available at our fingertips  It's time to start putting in some work and figure out how to stay stopped  Hmm  I am not sure at all but I certainly am intrigued  I tend to drop weight in withdrawal  decreased appetite  increased physical activity  etc   but I would be very curious if there was a correlation between weight loss and alleviation of withdrawal symptoms    Thought provoking  I'm back to day 2 but last year I went two months off booze and had some blood work done at the end  Normal liver kidney function and near perfect heart rate  Crazy how well your body can heal  I started drinking again on the way home from that doctor apt  Just not sure why   We can stay sober together     Welcome back  Good job  I quit when I was 21  and stayed sober for 8 years   and moving away from negative influences was a huge help   Excuse me I have to go tell a few people how much I fucking love them    This fucked me up     You write beautifully    This fucked me up      I remember reading a post of his a couple weeks ago  and it seemed he was in an awful place   So sorry for your loss OP       I think people worry too much about "Am I an alcoholic " and not enough about "Is alcohol negatively affecting my life "  I felt this way for a while but didn't know how to express it  This is a very good way of looking at it I'm very sorry for this loss and especially for the turmoil it is causing  You had nothing to do with his death  Alcoholism killed him  You didn't cause it  There is no way you could have fixed him  As an alcoholic myself  I was manipulative and told lies to those who loved me when I was active in my addiction  Not everything he told you was the whole truth     Through the black outs  selfish acts  cruel words  and all the times his alcoholism brought us both to our knees    It might help you to remember these times  If you had stayed with him  what was going to be different     I gave him everything I had   Giving him "everything" didn't fix him  and now you feel empty   Alanon and therapy helped me build myself from the inside out  What a waste it would be to let his death cause you to spend the rest of yours feeling depressed and guilty  Alanon meetings and therapy taught me how to take better care of myself  Now  it is your time  Thanks for sharing your heartbreak in this post  I hope you will get help for yourself  You are worth it   Wow  Thank you for sharing that  Sounds like a pretty solid plan  I love that it is incredibly action oriented  I think recovery should be a very active rather than passive journey  Good luck and stick around here  lots of good people with lots of insight and compassion   Same    high five  The first few months were a little rough mentally but after that  it's been a total breeze   I agree  we are awesome  Haha  Life looks pretty good from here   I'm right behind you at day 18  you desribed my state at this time perfectly  Wake up   instant waves of panic  worked a bit today  ive kicked other habits  but nothing touches this for me  I dont crave it either  i just have mind fuck and lethargy  I keep telling myself that ill come out on the other side of this like so many others here have  I just gotta keep going  to many responsibilities in my life not to  I hope it starts getting easier for you and me both  fuck kratom   Probably the most beautifully written post I've read on here  I'm not sure what else to say but this has left me somewhat speechless Haha  I was just funding with you  But ya  down south at least  calamari is salty as shit  I don't tell people anything  Only my wife knows I quit and even she doesn't know the extent of my drinking  If anyone asks why I'm not drinking I just say  I'm not drinking today  It's nobody's business  It's hard because it is your normal  You've wired you're brain to be like this  So when you stop  your brain is 'rewiring' itself  It's not a very comfortable process  but then again  rarely is anything that results in growth    That said  stick around here  There are lots of great people with lots of great advice and support   I wish you well friend   What sort of changes to your diet mitigated anxiety  Indeed we do  I was just fucking with my girl     No drinking for me today  I'm on day 3 too  We can do this  Hopefully  this intervention was being managed by a professional  Family members are hot equipped to manage them   Good job   Hmm  That's a very oof question  I was fortunate as my girolfriens whom I love with is not a smoker  However my siblings are  There is definitely a difference between seeing smokers and living with one  I feel there are some members here who could answer your question much more competently than I  I can't give you any answers but I feel you man    Best of luck  I was the same way  I never ran into problems at work  or with the law  or in my relationships due to drinking  Never had to go to detox and never went to any group or got treatment   The way I see it  I got off the bus early and dodged a bullet  That's something to feel good about every day  Isnt ketosis the basis of the atkins diet  Omg do you mean I can drink my way to a slimmer healthier me     Thanks  great video    I actually watched a few of his videos  really great content   I'm right next to you on your journey  You can do it   I won't drink with you today   There's nothing to be ashamed of   we drank an addictive substance and got addicted to it  Now we are addressing it   no big deal   My husband knows everything  we drank and quit together   His family knows a bit about our drinking and quitting  My family knows that I am counting calories and would rather have a slice of cake than a pint  Strangers get to know me as a non drinker  I'm also in  Let's do this  D I actually started a few days before NYE and my skin is already looking so much better    Just a lot of PIE to deal with now    but here's to not creating any more  The hardest part of all this is making the decision to stop  You got this I  am rooting for you  Nothing wrong with trying 101 times  Doing it is all that counts  Alcohol is addictive plain and simple  No moral defect  I support you into a sober life  I won't drink with you today   Don't sweat it  It took me over 10 times to quit   Apparently it's going ducking cold here tomorrow so I will not be going for a run   But I've made myself a workout room in the basement   Got my weights and elliptical out   Space to smoke and chill out afterwards in front of the fireplace   It will be a good day   https   imgur com a g5Tqi You may have a chance  heard he is going to tour again   guy is amazing I have seen  Gilmour  Waters and the complete Pink in the late 70 s and early 80's Great work keep it up  I lasted 2 days and did some picking today but nothing that caused bleeding yet  I just put lotion on my hands and I'm going to reset now  This is crazy  r keto was a huge help with my anxiety  I did this for 1 5 years now and will never go back to eating a standard American diet  4 days ago I started r zerocarb and the results are even more spectacular  It actually seems to make me feel crappier when I smoke now which is why I have been leading myself to quitting  When I'm sober now I feel actual happiness and I totally attribute it to being in ketosis  I feel like finding r leaves was a sign and I start day 1 tomorrow  This won't get upvoted enough  Yep  And normally insurance pays  so the person making the decision to buy isn't a rational consumer  It's why the ads all look like vacation packages  Fill 10 beds and you've got  300 000 per month  All ya need is a doc and some rubber stamp licenses  You don't even have to show results b c recovery rates are abysmal everywhere  Buy some beautiful coastal land  pour the income into the mortgage  and in 5 years you sell your "non profit" for 20 million bucks  As long as you can fill the beds it's like printing money  There is a lot of competition in filling those beds   check   Not drinking today  Call a local addiction counselor and or the local AA hotline  If she needs detox  she should see a doctor   Cheers  I'd tell you it's not worth it  or how he pushed you away and you should just not care   But you did care  and sounds like you always will  have a good one  really  I hope you'll find someone else  not to just drown your sorrows or forget  that's for us  we drown it any chance possible    I just hope you find more happiness in this shithole called reality  You seem like you deserve it   Im in a tough situation because me being skeptical   she sees it as I don't want to help  There is a local hospital that has inpatient Rehab I would prefer her to do that  Ugg  I am 9 days sober and it makes me want to drink I am stressed as hell  I am on day 3 too and I also have the same headache  I've been downing water like crazy and it seems to help a little  I will not drink with you today   Somebody just stood on my toe   Good news can give us false bravado I came off 5 months sober  drank through the summer  had 2 friends die in September and went hard for a month After much needed blood work  I got an immediate call from my doctor Liver Enzymes way up  Kidney function and Glucose were nuts But my BP was 196 127  I got it down in 3 weeks to 150 98  but it is a struggle     all because of booze   I'm going about it by only telling a few of my close friends and family because it's more of a personal goal for me  I smoked for 6 years and I'm nicotine free 62 hours  I'm dealing with one of my worst cravings right now but they do come and go  Most of the time I feel so good that I haven't touched a cigarette since Saturday but times like right now I'm so fucking irritated at everything    Chew some gum  Eat some sunflower seeds  You'll get over the cravings bro That's what the bottle says  No more than 4 a day but only every 6 hours  Don't care to seize again  I've had one 25mg capsule and feel pretty chipper   If you look on the sidebar you'll see request a badge   Here you can set your date    I'm curious as well  The break up of fat cells should release thc and thus alleviate symptoms   If your curious go on scholar and briefly look it up  There's some studies that show thc levels increasing in plasma upon fat loss  Pretty interesting   If you can see my above post you can see there is a local hospital with inpatient rehab  those are most likely anxiety dreams  Try meditating before bed and removing all stimuli a hour before bed time  Once the vivid dreams die down it won't be so much and issue   Lol yeah or buttsex   She's got two hands and three holes   Periods only affect one hole  yo  Bout tree fiddy  Good job  I love reading stories like this   How is today going   The craving doesn't go away for me  nor does the romanticizing  One thing that definitely helps is not to think about it as "never drinking again for the rest of my life " I can make it 24 hours  That's all I need  The most important day is TODAY   I'll definitely make it through a month just out of my own pride for not giving in so soon haha  May I ask  what made you decide to only just start quitting now then  OK   someone needs to speak up for the half years here  See ya for the 4th of July celebrations   God willing with extended support and many thanks to fellow SD'ers   SD rocks    Sounds like you could use more support  I went to AA and Alanon meetings because I wanted to stay sober and my partner abused alcohol  It was too overwhelming   I had almost 800 days sober and I drank again  And I think I regret it more than anything ever  It wasn't worth it one bit and it only confirmed what I think I needed to know  that no matter how long I've been sober  I'm still a drunk  and I will always go back to the old me as soon as I take that first sip  There is no moderation  There is no tolerance  I'm still an alcoholic  And no matter what happens today  good or bad  I will not drink  Sure  I was just fucking around  Glad my dumbass post was of some help    Someone asked me the other day if I was still "dry"   I hadn't even told them I was dry  so I was surprised when they asked  damn husband   so I just said  yeah  and I'm on a streak   They said good for you  and moved on     When I asked the husband later about it  he said Oh  I told him that we were both not drinking for awhile   So NBD  husband is not an alkie  so he didn't even think twice about mentioning it to our friend    Goddamnit  I only hope that you know that your level of passion must have shined through to him  I am in utter tears  You are a great person and will get through this  As some one who's been a slave to the bottle for many years I know the struggle that true loved ones go through  with you  as you fight yourself and anyone  sometimes  trying to help  Its a loss no matter what  but we die two deaths    Once when we stop breathing and once again when we are remembered for the last time  Long live the memory of the departed and may they rest in peace  I'm drinking one for you both   My husband and I quit at the same time because we both wanted it  I would have found it impossible to stay sober if he was still drinking  Sobriety involved major lifestyle changes and it's hard on any relationship if only one person changes and the other remains the same  Nobody can keep me sober but many people  especially my husband  can get me drunk if they catch me at a bad moment   As for support   I expect words of encouragement as well as actions to follow them  For my husband and I  it involved discussing what needed changing and applying the findings to our lives  For instance  we live by the dry people  dry places rule and expect our guests to conform to it as well  Then  there's this person who admired me for quitting and got me wine as a gift     I declined it   I have never told anyone anything  I just quietly go about my business and don't drink  Bupropion reduces the craving for nicotine  I tried it  and it significantly reduced my cravings  but it didn't help me quit    I think that being prescribed bupropion gave me the message that cravings are so terrible that you have to get rid of them in order to quit  After I read Allen Carr's book  I realized that withdrawal pangs aren't that bad  They may be uncomfortable  but they don't hurt and they don't last forever  Affirming my ability to handle an urge to smoke helped me far more than trying to get rid of the urge to smoke  First time I've done one of these  by "check in" I'm assuming you mean we have to post something  correct   Haven't had to tell anyone anything      yet  Going to a bar w  my spouse where we are regulars for the first time since I started drynuary      wish me luck  It's gotta happen sometime  can't be a shut in  I am so agitated right now  She has it in her head that she will fail because she can just walk out of Rehab close to home  So I am like oh so there are going to be no bars near the rehab you want to go to  Its on the beach in Florida  I give the fuck up  If it is paid by the INS in full and it cost me plane tickets so be it  I am so burnt out  Interesting  thanks for the reply  Rad  I've been doing a water fast and I feel flat out amazing at this point    kind of high  Kind of just relaxed and blessed out  I'm super grateful and I feel like my efforts are starting to pay off big time  Quitting weed has led to achieving the fasting state I've desired for so long but was unable to have self control over due to the munchies It may seem fucked up to you but that post was the most clear headed   planned out objective he'd probably had in months    It made me sort of happy to see   He was happy   Hey   congratulations  Sounds like quitting is a great plan     Those withdrawals can be nasty  Can I just link you to a checklist so you can get an idea of whether you should see a doctor or not   It sounds like it might be a good idea   http   hubpages com health Alcohol Withdrawal How Serious Are Your Symptoms  Best of luck to you   Talie No probs  happy cake day  Honestly  stuff like that is my motivation for kicking  forever  If I'm being honest with myself  if I knew where to score and not have to admit to my family I needed more  there were days I would have done it  Never moved to harder things  but I can understand the allure  But I know that I'm only 34  so this is going one of two ways  Either I get better and stay clean  or I eventually lose everything  And I have way too great a life to lose everything  Good job  great wife  great kids  nice house in a good neighborhood  Only way forward is to push through  Stay strong yourself  Good or bad  no matter what I will not drink today  Sounds like me  I've just submitted my badge to be reset to yesterday    Living in a spot where there are many breweries  wineries  etc makes it super challenging  Most things that people do here for entertainment revolve around those industries  especially all my friends   New year  time to buckle down and focus on getting more work done instead of settling for cheap entertainment     Best of luck to you     I understand  I was referring more to when you were 6 years oldish  and had infinite energy and had never even known what drugs and alcohol felt like    and didn't care or need to  I like to draw inspiration from my childhood sometimes and I find it brings me calm  peaceful energy  Don't give any excuses for your job  I used to dance as well  and still enjoy it and practice on our pole at home  and there's nothing to be ashamed of  You're helping lonely people feel good  and that's honorable  It's a very difficult job and that's why you get reimbursed like you do  Good for you finding something that works for you and using it  If you can dance  you're physically and mentally strong  and you can overcome addiction just like you overcame your nerves the first night on the job  You can do this  I'm so sorry   So very sorry for your loss   I remember his posts   It struck a chord with me because I remember wishing I could just go to sleep and never wake up to stop inflicting pain on my family and loved ones   I shed a tear for both of you tonight and I hope and pray you find peace   There was nothing you good do to fix this problem but you tried your damnedest and we were wrong about you  I laughed my ass off   I needed that  I just treated the cravings like symptoms of an illness  They came as reminders of being sick  First I was very ill indeed and the symptoms were severe   clenching jaw  obsessive thoughts  unable to concentrate   then after 10 days they got milder because I started to recover  Whats left now is a deep regret about not having quit years ago and no cravings at all    Think of  going through a short period of uncomfortable living on your way to a much calmer  healthier and happier life  Don't forget that there is only one simple thing you have to do to achieve the cure  don't smoke today and never again  Good luck Hey  I don't know what you're going through   I'm 52 or so  hours into withdrawal  and kind of hating myself too  But I know that killing yourself is not the solution  It's a permanent fix for a temporary problem   Whatever you're fighting  it is beatable  It's may not be easy  it will take time  but I believe in you   There's way better people on here to respond  There's a sticky about suicide too  if you need links  Call someone  talk to someone  Please  Suicide doesn't make a problem go away  it just puts the pain on other people   We believe  in you  The memories of the actual content of my nightmares have faded but Lordy do I remember having nightmares  The kind where you choke out screams and wake up soaked in sweat  Don't miss that   Now it's just the normal stuff where my pirate ship won't be safe to travel in because of the current typhoon so we all have to sit in 2 feet of water in the living room and watch TV while waiting for it to pass  Usually everyone else in my dreams are also drinking  Thanks  jerks  Hope you get some good sleep soon   really  there's no one in front of a machine with music   Food truck  you say  Right day 1 done  kKinda   First night tho  Went to bed at 10 it's now 12 30 and I'm wide awake  occasional cold sweats  no doubt this will be my state until about 4 am then 3 hours later I'll wake up soaked with sweat and freezing  The joys  Tonight has been ok tho  didn't get back from work till 8 so by the time id had a bath and a bit of tv it was an acceptable time to go to bed  Valium would be a life saver right now   im currently having this same feeling and im on 9 days  I can only speak to my own situation  My husband is not a talker so he doesn't ever give words of encouragement  But he is a man of integrity and a man of his word  If he said he would support me  he wouldn't drink in front of me and he would never take me to bars       Best of luck to you  Not drinking with you today   dude i clicked it but the music sucked so i bailed  Fabulous  Keep up the good work  The pink cloud is generally understood as that time right after you quit drinking and the withdrawals are gone and you feel amazing because you've felt like shit for so long and you're 100  confident that you'll be sober forever because everything is great now  It happened to me around week 2  Then when the pink cloud bursts is usually when you realize forever is actually a LONG ASS TIME and there's no way in real life anyone can not drink FOREVER and then you freak out  And then in come the Wise old sages of sobriety to remind you THIS is why you take it one day at a time  Just for today    Also  still foggy here so no good answer on that front    Glad you're back   I won't drink with you today     Something to consider  when I had JUST started taking kratom  I switched how I meal prepped my chicken  I'm kind of a fitness junkie of sorts   I had baked my chicken before and then started grilling  Well turns out I had undercooked my chicken when I switched to grilling it  So I was having upset stomach pains  Bloated feeling  diarrhea  the whole 9 yards  I immediately attributed the stomach pain to my new found "supplement" kratom  So I quit kratom for a while but the stomach pain symptoms were still present  It finally clicked in my brain that "hey maybe it's something else" lol and so I looked up eating undercooked chicken symptoms and what do you know  that was what was causing it    Moral of the story  it might be something other than kratom causing the thyroid issues  I do think you should see a doctor asap and don't be afraid to say kratom use  Don't let people discourage you from telling a doctor about kratom use bc it may be a statistic that could help make it illegal  Your health is more important   I will not drink today   o you but that post was the most clear headed   planned out objective he'd probably had in months             It made me sort of happy t  Hats off and a toast to a hero Me neither   Oh yes  that is so true  Thank you very much   I really never thought of myself being a self help person  I tried quitting so many times  I never once thought about researching the process online or use a forum  Without your app and the missions I would never have made it  Thank you very much  this app will safe lives  That's what you all called me  he called me  The title was "Chatting up a Normie" That's where I learned for the first time there was more there than I could've known  He had no idea why I kept coming around  I read all of this after the fact  of course  I cant reference the post because he found out one of his friends was searching his posts and he wiped them  That post made me so angry because none of you knew me and I have been through so many ugly things and still I was just a "normie" to you    But honestly  it doesn't matter if you believe me or believed him  The only time I ever feel any peace is when I am helping his parents  for which I have created a gofundme and will be more than happy to send to you via pm  obituary included  and right now  reading what you all have to say about him  His alcoholism and crippling anxiety depression kept him pretty isolated  He didn't really have friends outside of me  and in the end one other person  I don't have anyone else to grieve with  So I'm sorry if this was disruptive to you  I'm just trying to get by  man   I did not see it as melodramatic at all   sometimes we just need help ASAP  And fewer outbursts and arrests is something to be proud of  I lost it when you said you'd make 2017 your bitch  LOVE IT  Rock on  rockstar   Excellent  I am not drinking with you  I agree  I hope I didn't come off the wrong way   Maybe the only way is to just say "you stumbled upon these bags and were wondering what they were " I know Ive been through NA and agree you that she should not be on this   Just trying to help in any way possible   Confrontation might be the only way to find out the truth    You might solicit the phone numbers of a few recovering addicts or alcoholics from local help lines to come in and talk with these people   It can be helpful having someone available with first hand knowledge   In addition  NA and AA have people available who can come and talk to your staff during an in service about their experiences detoxing and recovering      Thank you for reaching out to learn more   We need more curious professionals like yourself   We all play a part in helping people out of the downward spiral that is addiction  edit  also  this person's formatting matches exactly that of the  u 's format  Great job  Such a big accomplishment  The sleepless nights and the cold sweats are the worst  Why I didn't choose to start on the weekend when I could have just stayed up all night and day so I was actually tired the following night I don't know   When I say the worst  I mean after the depression and the lack of emotions   Don't look forwards to going through all that again     I've never been able to sleep tho since I was a kid  till I hit 12 and started smoking most nights  Even when I've quit for months at a time 3 4 hours a night is the most I ever get and it sucks because then I'm even more tired  depressed and grumpy    oh and loss of appetite  had 1 bit of chicken all day today lol   Good luck tho mate  thanks  I'll check them out  I'm sober    trying to get on top of my own mental heath too    But yes  a hat tipping indeed  There's a lot of things I really enjoy the taste of  I'm sure you can name a whole bunch of foods you LOVE but don't eat everyday and don't think about them on days you're not eating them  And don't have to worry about stopping once you've started eating them   Alcohol isn't like other non addictive things in our lives  One of the most important distinctions I made early on was realizing that I liked wine in a different way than I liked other things  I liked it so much I was preoccupied with it  Wanted it everyday  Thought about it when I couldn't have it   Being honest with myself and realizing that as a grown woman  I was fully able to control myself around all kinds of other things I liked   but not this   Edited to add  They do make non alcoholic wine  I don't personally think that drinking N A wine is a good alternative for somebody with a problem with alcohol  but it might be good to try it and see whether it's  really  about the taste of wine for you  or if it's the alcohol  Because if it's actually just the taste  you've solved your problem already      Thank you guys  that means a lot     I still have thoughts like "Hey I'm young  what can a few shots of vodka or a glass of wine or a beer do when I'm hanging out with friends " But my few shots turn into 10 and a glass or 1 beer turn into litres  So it's better to remove all of it I guess  I don't want to look tired and have a red puffy face when I am older   I will not drink today  But I'm on my way to a fancy dinner and that is a trigger for me  fancy cocktails    I have my meal planned out though and it doesn't include alcohol  Spindrift Grapefruit  So good   Second place is a tie between Polar black cherry and Polar Orange Vanilla  Well thanks all for the support  But it looks like my INS is covering the whole  30 000  I only have to pay for the flight  But I loose my wife for 48 days  I want her to lick this thing and she just was not having anything else  I am wicked stressed  I mean this happened in the course of an hour and a half  Ugg Hi   I see you're pretty new to SD and I wanted to let you know that we have a system for how the SD Daily Check In gets posted   You are welcome to use it anytime of the day  there's always a link to it at the top of the page   If you want to do a personal check in at another time of day  please title it something different than "check in " as that holds a specific meaning here on SD   Regardless  I won't drink with you today  I kind of feel like an asshole  but if this true then I send my sincere condolences  I'm always a skeptic   Ohhh the bickering with my SO  Almost broke up a few days ago because I was drunk and hysterical for no reason at all  Luckily it gave me the final push  Very well put   As someone else once wrote  we continue to move the goalposts   The expression that "an alcoholic is someone who drinks more than you" is so appropriate   There's always that person chugging a fifth in the morning that can we go "wowza  look at that guy" and feel better about sneaking a beer at a time when we shouldn't     In the end  do we really want to benchmark ourselves by those who have been harmed even more   WTF kind of logic that  I kind of think of it as a good problem  I am grateful that most of my friends drink responsibly and don't need to quit  from reading here it seems quite a huge challenge to handle someone who is close and has an alcohol problem  so     if my friends are not in anything anonymous I try to remember this is good news   I tried to quit plenty of times  Breaking a week seemed almost impossible until this time   Thanks a milli I tried the spindrift a few weeks ago  I loved the cucumber  It's quite expensive though      awesome   also not drinking will help you gather the resources you need to get a better job  drinking allows us to ignore what we're unhappy about for years      I'm 24  a month clean  Started heroin at 17 years old  Was completely abstinent for 3 years from everything  and I can offer a lot of tips and advice  I've been thru the ringer  Good luck  you can do it  you are strong  message me if you'd like to talk or have any questions about what to do next  Much love  I'm back in action with you buddy   I will not drink with you today   Thats about were I am after a long taper   Using less that 4 grams for about 4 days straight   you start to even out and you don't feel NEARLY as shitty as when you were taking larger amounts   for me 30g plus   Im at 3 grams for about 5 days and feel just fine   Im going down another g tomorrow and I'm sure there will be a few shitty days but nothing like CT which I tried at 30gs daily   Day 3 I caved   I just couldn't handle it  It was so bad  Tapering   if you can stick to a plan and go down about a gram every 5 days can be done with ease  This is coming from a 3 year habit    It's okay  so was he  And quite honestly  I'm also still imagining conspiracy theories to explain it too   I think that's what they call "Proper" formatting   Oh lord I played so many video games  So many  Distraction worked wonders   And spoiling yourself with your favorite food  Don't worry about anything but staying sober for a little while  Be good to yourself  You're doing a hard thing but a great thing  Congrats    First day of pledging  day two of no drinking  I will not drink today   yeah man come hang out   i'll talk you out of quitting your job and buying one   unless you wanna move to florida and work with me   Been playing so much on my phone  Need an actual gaming system it sounds like    Day 3 CT  I have been using for about six months with a few short week or two week breaks throughout  I am on the third day of CT withdrawals and while it is unpleasant  I am surprised to find that I am making it through     I am currently getting my master's but am on break from school and staying with my parents  Part of the reason I put off quitting was because my busy schedule having to teach high school and take college classes  Anyway  now that I am home for the holidays  I broke the news to my mother and she is very supportive and helping me through the withdrawals but I know that I am going to have to face the situation once I reach the other side  Having helped me through heroin w d and rehab and all the intertwined  my family is going to be extremely upset with me  For now  I am glad that I am getting the support that I need and it breaks my heart to know that I have hurt them     As for symptoms  right now I have the chills  anhedonia  lethargy  GI issues  I have been taking acetaminophen and ibuprofen accordingly and have been taking very low doses of dicyclomine hcl for the stomach  I am worried that this will prolong the w d experience  anyone know    Lots of showers and baths for relaxation and melatonin for sleep    Getting through this  lots of love  you gotta kinda add to the music   dont be the problem  Glad to not drink with you today  Success  Now go treat yourself to something yummy   I'm in the exact same position right now  Embarrassed myself on new years and drank on the 1st to keep the hangover at bay  Girlfriend said she needed space from me because these sorts of drink sneaking benders have happened too often since we moved in together  So I'm at home  spending a few days with my mom  Thanks for sharing your reset  We won't drink today   Keep it up  It got better each day for me  the only food truck i wanna work for are the ones in maine with medicated tacos Actually  it is a bit spammy   You are welcome to direct people to the sidebar  but please don't post the link yourself   Thanks  I'll be sober with you  Congrats on day 50  HIGH FIVE     Spending any money kills me  but it was sooooo easy for me when it was for booze  I just moved from Fort Campbell   What BBQ place in Nashville are you talking about  Not today  Not today  Not today    I won't drink with you today   Wow they give dilaudid for heroin detox  That surprises me   Hang in there  holy fucking shit Thanks for responding  Just trying to take it a day at a time  I just hope I didn't do too much damage  Good for you   After my work day  I had really high anxiety and wanted a glass  or two  of wine  I did some deep breathing exercises and had tea  I'm proud of myself   It's  4 99 for a four pack in many grocery stores  but at Hannaford supermarkets it's  4 99 for an eight pack  Don't know why  but I'm not gonna ask questions   You two are the same person and you're just having one of those weird judgmental "still alive" funerals  We love ya  bud  You don't have shit to prove    You're my favourite normie   his too   4 days and you think you have superpowers haha  If you think you broke your steak you did  Be honest with yourself   The sidebar link didn't take me to the free copy  Maybe I was looking in the wrong place  Had to google to find it You just inspired me to keep going  Im at day 27  and its up n down  But when I read your words "1 year"  suddenly I felt strong again  Thank you I am sorry we couldn't dissuade him     Guessing this is the SO of u werunfromcops     Thank you so much for trying    Trying to help him    For what it's worth  I wish I could be a "normie " I don't want to die from this and hurt my loved ones    And I might die from this condition  but I vow that I will not intentionally take my own life  I  will  live on        It's actually not proper at all  no one starts a paragraph without an indentation   Evenings were my usual "start time" as well  That's why you will find me here this time of day   Congrats  Welcome  Hang on  It gets better with time   I have to say those Bulgarian Halloween costumes are terrifying  I love your attitude  You will do well in Al Anon  The reality is the demographic does skew older  I started when I was 30    And I felt young  Lol in my experience people want quick painless solutions    And that's just not the nature of what we deal with with our friends and family    So Al Anon didn't appeal to them     When I came in    Other than my own baggage I was dealing with a close friend who had a substance abuse issue and my dad  a problem drinker     That friend is now an acquaintance  She got some help  but it wasn't necessarily a happy ending  Al Anon helped me navigate that transition in a thoughtful healthy way     There's a lot of wisdom in those old timers at the meeting  Best of luck to you  I use a Samsung galaxy edge myself and would be happy to add my 2cents   I personally use  Podcast Addict  https   play google com store apps details id com bambuna podcastaddict hl en   Not only did the name seem fitting  it's free and relatively straight forward to use and they have a cool algorithm to that will look at what you listen to and recommend other podcasts    i mean fuck  play a song and i'll bounce off that   this warehouse is just lonely and boring as fuck   Aw crap  This makes me very sad  He had a good heart  Guess his demons got the better of him  My condolences to his family and to you  The bit about knowing your going to smoke again before you die always does it for me  I've never tried to quit for any reason other than money or trying to motivate me to do more because I think I should  If I'm honest I love weed  I love getting high  only thing I don't like is how it effects me socially   I hate meeting new people when I'm high because I just overthink the situation I get claustrophobic high anxiety in public places when I'm high And I spend too much money on it Aside from that I think people are better when they smoke  more relaxed  less obnoxious  less confrontational  funnier   I don't know  Sorry I'm going on its just I'm kinda trying to reinforce my reason for quitting on myself and I'm having a hard time lol   I need to quit for the simple fact that I can't  I have friends that can go a week without it and not be bothered  I go a night and I'm up all night sweating hating life considering smoking butts just for a slight buzz so I can sleep   THAT is why I need to quit   Wait until I tell the story of Mr  Wong  Then you will laugh  Happy new year to you too and good luck  I'm actually in NY  and yes apparently in the felony treatment court they didn't allow suboxone or methadone or anything like that but I guess they changed the rules and now they do  I was nervous about whether they were going to let me continue to be on subs because it's the only thing that helped me stay clean  So thank god they do    The process is 18 months  I got 10 months left to go  It kind of sucks dealing with the court and everything  I haven't used since February but I've been sick here and there with bronchitis or whatever and still have to watch carefully what I take  I was prescribed Flonase nasal spray and it came up for alcohol  luckily they didn't give me a hard time about it but they have before  About 2 months back I was sick and took cough medicine that I though was alcohol free since i didn't see alcohol anywhere on the bottle  I didn't know I had to actually get something that said "alcohol free" otherwise it most likely does contain alcohol  So just be super careful with that  Like I said it sucks but at least the charges will be gone thank god  Idk what I would do if I had to live with 2 felony charges   i dont drink much beer  but i do work at alot of breweries and they give all my workers all the beer they can drink   I won't drink with you    Thanks so much  all makes good sense   Appreciate the company    I say   Alcohol makes me feel bad  so I quit drinking  I don't elaborate but 'feel bad'  in my mind it stands for all the physical  mental and emotional stuff       I've never tried to quit for any reason other than money or trying to motivate me to do more because I think I should   If I'm honest I love weed  I love getting high  only thing I don't like is how it effects me socially  I hate meeting new people when I'm high because I just overthink the situation  I get claustrophobic high anxiety in public places when I'm high And I spend too much money on it Aside from that I think people are better when they smoke  more relaxed  less obnoxious  less confrontational  funnier   I don't know maybe that's just me   Sorry I'm going on its just I'm kinda trying to reinforce my reason for quitting on myself and I'm having a hard time lol   I need to quit for the simple fact that I can't    I have friends that can go a week without it and not be bothered  I go a night and I'm up all night sweating hating life considering smoking butts just for a slight buzz so I can sleep   THAT is why I need to quit  Private sub   I don't follow  I'm a member of a couple private subs but those aren't related to alcohol  and the one private alcohol sub I have access to was made by somebody else and we're making chicken  green apple and fresh sage sausage   if anyone has any ideas  i have about 7lb of pork butt to do some kinda pork sausage  I'm only on my third day but I prep myself for any mental shenanigans by giving myself a mental script something to the effect of "be advised  while you are on your mission  doing whatever  enemy agents may attempt to subvert the outcome by poisoning you with ethanol   Be on the lookout "   No matter how much you beg  I will not drink with you today  How long did it take before you saw skin improvements  Commit to six meetings before deciding whether Al Anon might be a right fit you  And if you don't feel like you get something out of the first meeting you attend  try a meeting at a different location or ask members if there's a different meeting they would suggest  Meetings are run by members and quality varies     The most important thing to know is that you are not alone  There are others who have experienced or are experiencing what you are dealing with  Big hugs  Not familiar with that show  I'll look into it  Congrats on a sober NYE  How is everything going so far    Kombucha is something  that if you didn't tell me it had alcohol in it  I would never know  I'm honestly not sure what sets off the brain chemistry  if it's the alcohol itself  or if it's knowing you are drinking it  Everyone has their own standards  but  for me at least  if the FDA has deemed it functionally non alcoholic or safe for children to consume  then I wouldn't worry about it  I know what I'd do to a a 7lb pork butt  I think if you served that  it would be a health code violation   JK of course  I think  Congratulations  I'm really excited to read your post it sounds realistic and encouraging  Thanks for sharing  I am currently abroad but when I get back home in a couple of weeks I am going to look for a therapist  Which podcasts would you recommend   You keep working that body of yours  VP  "That's what you all called me  he called me " Who is calling what who in that sentence  You are fucking drunk  Sorry  I just saw you said you haven't found a replacement yet  For me I like journaling  meditating  exploring interests on YouTube  I got inspired by minimalism and meal planning with this   I'm not sure what your jam is  1  Super Affordable refills   2  small and modern design doesn't make it stand out like the shoe boxes people smoke out of these days   3  still packs a punch  You're not going to be blowing clouds of smoke like a lot of vapes  but why would you want to   4  say goodbye to your clothes and breath smelling like shit all the time   5  You can smoke the thing inside      Bottom line  if you don't want to smell like shit  pay for over priced cigs  but at the same time avoid the  lame ass vaping culture  this product is amazing    More details on my smoking habits and experience making the shift    To break this down  this is the first vape I've found that can completely eliminates my urge to smoke regular cigarettes     Been smoking since 18  so about 7 years  Was up to a pack a day  Living in Chicago  with Packs at  12 a pop  I needed to switch it up    Knew vaping was cheaper  but this product absolutely kills it  Each pack of "pods" you buy Comes with 4  Each pod is equal to a pack of cigarettes in terms of nicotine    I pay a little over  40 bucks a week for 8 pods that would otherwise cost me of over  100  with taxes  if I were smoking the regular thing    Edit  this product is also created by the same company that produces Pax vaporizer  I'm so sorry for your loss and am so glad you can come to the right places to share your story   just ground the first 10lbs of chicken and now im chilling the fat before folding and seasoning     i swear if the market gave me shit casings  there may be some arson   maybe not arson  but some well placed and clever spray paint  Sometimes it's until they can get an existing methadone dose sorted   When someone has been through rehabs it's easier to get truthful info from those places   I don't know if someone just coming off the street would have as much luck as my pt a few days ago  we knew she had a methadone dose that she picked up inconsistently  and she had broken her back several years before and has chronic pain problems   She had a pretty good dose going while we confirmed her dose and was very displeased with us when we switched her to the methadone  Thanks doll  Would you be able to call your insurance company to ask about rehab coverage and maybe get a list of places they cover   Would probably not be open 24 hrs  but they might also have info online   Just a thought  Good luck  dude  i can get down on some white kid hip hop   come over https   www dubtrack fm join caflow Oh please    I need your stories  Ahh  3 15 on a Tuesday right when you get off work   that was also one of my favorite times to drink  I feel like if I can make it to 6pm  I don't feel like drinking because I prefer to drink earlier in the day  3 6pm were my hardest times of the week  Keep up the good work  I will not drink with you today  So great to read about your success  Awesome work   I love your early mornings  I am not a morning person by nature  but I'm finding mornings so much more pleasant these days        I can't even remember when I quit  which must be a good thing  At least one or two months now   Life is full of so much more and improving all these aspects of REAL LIFE is hard enough as it is  I can't comprehend how I mustered the time to play games all day  I guess I just didn't care  BBQ is a definite win  For me  treating myself from time to time  especially for my milestones  that first month  I rewarded myself every week  bc that was my hardest time  has helped to keep me motivated    Lately I've been slowing down on the treats  partly bc of the holidays  and partly to spread out the rewards to give myself something to look forward to even more  My Day 100 was Dec  12  and the following week  as a belated celebration  my sister and younger brother treated me to a great night of my favorite Indian takeout  and hanging out  My brother had come down for Christmas early to celebrate with me  and it really meant a lot to me  It definitely reminds me that sobriety  doesn't  always suck  and I can have a great time without the alcohol   Sober on  my friend  hope that BBQ plate kicks ass     The moment I decided to try and quit for good  early last year  almost a year free  yay   I bought a planner that fits in my backpack    In my planner  I write how many days video game free each day  as well as a tentative schedule for next day    I give myself time to relax  of course  as I believe trying to fill every hour on end with something leads to burnout  sorry breesushandson  too each their own     I don't get so down on myself if my life sways and I get thrown off schedule  but its nice knowing that I have a schedule  and video games are never a part of it  This man speaks truth  Those PAWS are the true test  They're the reason I'd relapsed after getting clean on my own once and they're the reason I went the route of medically assisted therapy to get fully clean  Those damn invasive thoughts    pork butt is also known as the shoulder   its the cut of pork they use for BBQ pork at a barbecue place   it also has the ideal amount of fat for sausage making  I'm right there with you   Currently sitting in my car at a park   I will not drink with you today   Well done  Congratulations  Thinking about the post bender anxiety just gave me anxiety  Haha  I won't drink with you today  Maybe you need to get better treatment for your depression  I'm close to quitting myself but am trying to get my depression under control prior   Just a thought   My previous substance abuse counselor would refer to that as a "slip" as opposed to a complete relapse  he explained that a relapse is essentially reverting back  even a short period of time  to where you were previously at   For me  secretly binge drinking to the point of unconsciousness   I wouldn't reset the badge   I'm not really here for acceptance  recognition  or approval  I know I shouldn't feed the trolls  but fuck man  I know you don't believe I am  but I'm seriously grieving  I'm just trying to make it to the end of the day  Can you please stop   A NORMAL CA  I love it  Smokey  Ha  If I could drink in moderation I'd do it all day  every day    Congratulations   I like how you phrased that  30 decisions not to drink  Well done  You bet   Holy cow when I think about the money spent on alcohol    pretty much anything I want in the grocery store right now is mine   MINE       I can't afford a therapist  I tried seeing a student therapist and it was a fucking joke  sooo awkward 1000 times worse than an awkward first date  As a mom of two teenagers  I have to repeat the ol saying "they grow so fast"  Don't waste these wonderful years being strung out  You WILL regret it and you will never get this time back  I think the best ages are right around the corner from you  6 10 is so so magical  Don't miss out   Wow   that is so cynical   the profiteers  not you  Congrats on a sober trip around the sun  Well done  Your mornings sound wonderful  Your okay as long as you just post  None of this "long time lurker  first time poster" shit  or "I drink xx drinks a day  am I a CA"  I really isn't too hard   Later  my dear  I have a headache  I think one of the hardest things about detox is you tend to forget fairly quickly the reasons why you wanted to get clean in the first place  People come into detox because life on the streets really sucks bu it's not long before the obsession of using comes back and you and wanna run back to what you were doing before because that obsession controls all your thoughts  Please know just doing what you were doing is amazing and don't fault yourself if your efforts are don't stop someone from giving in to temptation  Your efforts aren't in vain and you'll find that you'll get those patients who do really want this and who do make it and will remember the kindness you've shown them  When it comes down to it it's just up to the individual whether they want to continue on  You're doing everything you can  It's a long and shitty road but know that when someone makes it in recovery they will be grateful for what you've done for them  Also  I would focus more on the patients who don't beg for meds every five minutes  Isolate yourself from all gaming media  I'll wait for it   I've been entertained enough and now I'm ready for bed       Welcome and congratulation on deciding to make some big changes in your life   As is said here   you never have to feel like that again   I will not drink with you today  I have two main points to prove that you are who I think you are  You write in the exact same style and fashion as said person and that is very rare  Second  you are only responding to me  quite suspicious  I'll believe whatever if you have proof  checking in  still going strong  Cravings for me are emotion riddled thoughts propelled by years and years of reinforcement and conditioning   Aka   cravings seemed intensely important to me  But I stopped reacting to them and it gave them less power  oh he killed himself for sure  It wasn't pleasent but suicide never is  He's not suffering any more  Hey man great job  Sounds like things are really looking up for you   I like what you said about distracting yourself in the "real world " I'm on day 6 myself and I'm finding myself compulsively checking Facebook and Reddit etc  like refreshing and going back and forth endlessly  It's a kind of restless anxiety  I'm happy you said that  it reminds me to get out of my head  Thanks for your post   It is tough  You're right to be skeptical  and chances are she will blame resent you for whatever she does or doesn't do  If she goes elsewhere and fails  your fault  If she goes to this one and fails it'll become a pink elephant that you dare not mention and will cause tension   I think it's best you insert a third party here  A local doctor  an addiction specialist  a government addiction social worker type  something like that  If you call up county health services   say you're considering rehab and want to talk to someone they probably have a person who does that   That way  you won't have to be the skeptical one  She won't perceive you as a meddler    I'm obviously generalizing addict behavior here and have no idea what your partner will or won't do  If it were me  I'd think  why take the risk  No downside of getting a third party involved  lots of potential downside in my voicing an opinion  I'd see this one as a no brainer    As for you  ha  I remember being 9 days sober  It's not fun  You will feel much differently on day 100  but to get there you've gotta get through days 9  10  etc  Be sure to look after yourself as well   I know that         Yup  you have outlined The American Way     When we read about murderers in Europe getting like 20 years we can't believe it   If we're feeling nice we'll Supermax a murderer   More likely we'll give them the electric chair  and then send the family the bill for the electricity  Its really all about not looking back  There isn't any point in beating yourself up and saying what if  I use to swim back in highschool and made varsity my freshman year and was one of the fastest swimmers on the team  However  when I switched schools junior year I ended up quitting swimming  I didn't think about "What if I could of made state or nationals " I think about the fun time I had and then continue to enjoy whats in front of me    In gaming I smile when I think about the fun times I had  but that part of my life is over and I am currently in a new chapter in my life  I don't think about "If I still played i could of played that game" as it would just make me down and I would probably relapse eventually  Its just training yourself to be satisfied with ones past rather than in regret   Go to bed  My stories can wait  It involves crossdressing  getting the shit beat of you  and Brazil         I will not drink today first time i ever tried to really reach out here and it was one nice dude and a guy that won't ever be happy   guess that's kinda what i was looking for    If the shoulder is the butt  then what is the butt  Nevermind  I'd still fap to it    just fuckin with ya  Good luck with the food truck   "Thanks  jerks " Nearly spat out my Polar    hang in there i can only imagine the strength required  but you can do this   Day one here too  I got two months earlier this year and they were wonderful  We can do this   Hm sorry being called a "normie" made you mad  I think it's a bit of a tacky word myself but I get the reasoning for it  it's used by a lot of different types of groups  It's not to say you haven't been through shit or anything  just that you presumably aren't another addict  It's not like an insult   Also sorry he was told there's no way things could work  It's just that most of us through drinking  have lost a ton of people we loved that loved us  some of us have lost literally everybody  We regularly fuck up relationships with people we have so it's nothing  personal when people say it wouldn't work    Because based on our experiences  in a long enough amount of time  it probably wouldn't  Not because you're a "normie" but because of his alcoholism  Even if you stuck around forever and did everything you could  alcoholism is vicious as you know and everybody has breaking points  That's my perspective from my experience anyway  maybe things wouldn't have been like that for you all    Anyway sorry for your loss  That is pretty awful to say the least  Sorry I don't really have anything to say that can help Sounds like a great plan  I am with you  I began this journey Dec 29ish last year    4ish relapses later I am back   High Five Its a nice idea and it could perhaps work for some people  You could modify it a bit to something like "Make a deal to not play games in exchange for something small every month  If you fail you give a large amount of money to said person "  Not a bad plan if someone is in the right spot for it  just not for every situation  Musician here as well   Band practice has always been tricky for me too but I try to remember all of the times that I went too far and really couldn't play like I wanted to   For a long time I thought it helped  and maybe that first drink or two loosened me up a bit and made jamming seem easier   but inevitably the fourth  fifth  eighth drink had me sucking in no time   Or at least not playing like I could have been   Nothing worse than feeling it and hearing it in your head and it not translating to your hands because you're too drunk   Not drinking with you today   or at my next practice    holy shit thats unbelievable   i guess the ones that are not affected its no big deal for the rest of us   not so much  Drink it  What could possibly go wrong     Thank you  I really appreciate it  I know I should spend more time in this sub to keep me on track   so many good people here   High Five back   You can do it for your boys xx Yeah man I signed up too and apparently somebody matched with me  but I never recieved any match either and had basically forgotten until dude who got me hit me up    Did anybody send a gift and not receive something   Thanks for the perspective  I can relate to your choice for swimming  I'm still trying to appreciate the good times and acknowledge that it's time to move on  I think it'll definitely take a shift in perspective on my part to avoid those "what if" questions   I realized that  Real Strength  manifests in first being Honest with myself and those around me  and secondly  working on my stuff   It was hard for me to accept that I wasn't "really in control" but I sure wanted to believe that I was     The John Wayne "strong silent type" didn't do anybody any favors   What I tell others  and what you tell others  is really up to the individual   When I stopped  I only told my wife  my physician and my counselor  This is what I'm shooting for   I did six months last year but fell off in Oct   I got a plan to make it a year   then the day after that     Congratulations   Well said   its weird how i can care for others so much       and treat myself not so well I have anxiety pretty bad today too  I hope you feel better soon    nope  but you might get some beer worms or worse   sometimes when i expect to get the trots  i'll swallow corn or pennies   that way i always get a laugh in the morning when i need one   To the day 1 and 2's  keep going you can do it  To the day 3 and beyond  you had the worst 2 days  why not try another two  To the day 5 and beyond  what's a week after five whole days  Come on chappies  Together we will pull through   One day at the time  Checking in with you good good people of SD  I will not drink with you today   The age would probably make it hard on your stomach  but if you poured them in your butt I think they'd work pretty well oh sorry  im not thinking clearly   S'all good homes   3 Well I doubt ur health insurance is gonna pay for you to go to Thailand but they will however pay for u to go somewhere in USA  Try ambrosia in Florida it's a great facility  Oh  I have since then rethought my stance on it  I don't mind being called a normie  At the time though  I was being a grump about it  I was making an attempt at lightheartedness when I mentioned it  This subreddit has given me more perspective than I care to admit  I've lurked it whenever it felt like it was getting to be too much  and I sympathize  I've known addicts my whole life and this has helped me find some peace  I used to tell him that too  loving him and enduring the fucked up times with him  helped me understand so much about the things I couldn't when I was young  So you do have something to say that can help  Thank you   I used to roll my eyes when people told me they were allergic to alcohol  but I noticed when I was drinking my nose was closed up at night and I couldn't sleep   On periods when I've stopped for a week or two  I have not had the problem    I was really hoping for an excuse for my wife to give away her cats too      Was your year more productive as a result  Need some motivation as I'm about to begin my alcohol free year Check these guys out  for example  Respectable sounding Narconon is just a front for Scientology   https   en wikipedia org wiki Narconon  Their entire treatment plan consists of yelling  shaming  and administering niacin enemas  They kill people every year  Every year  They've got dozens of treatment centers  none of whose brochures mention Scientology  of course  They get away with it because no one knows what the fuck to do about addiction   Addicts show up  are taught that addiction happens because of a vitamin imbalance  and that escaping addiction requires a lifetime of 'spiritual work' in Scientology    It's a seedy  seedy world  Anything you find arousing and seek online is porn  It's a relapse and a failure  Eliminate access to the material  i dunno how that stuff works  i have to sign up or something   edit  also is your username a reference to atmosphere  "ive got a retraining order against satan's daughter and i keep it at the bottom of this jameson and water"   Hells yeah  Would have been amazing to realize at 22  49 here   i like it when people maintain their username's theme   and thanks for the well wishes   is this really how it is when you try and hang out here    am i doing it wrong  or is it just fuck all   And you're hiring   I realize this is a little different for this sub  but it's something people should still keep in mind when fighting through an addiction   Just because you may have been addicted to gaming for years and years  doesn't mean that time was completely wasted  Sure you could've done something more productive  but don't beat yourself up too much about it  because at the time you were really enjoying yourself and creating fond memories   Now you've wizened up  and come to realize that you want more from life  and that's a good thing  But remember  everything we do  good or bad  leads to developing us into who we are today  I didn't use the patch this last and final quit but I did the first time I quit and I hated those dreams aswell  Someine suggested that I take the patch off when I sleep and it seemed to help alot  Congrats on making it this far  That was a hard read  I'm so glad you didn't get hurt   killed and didn't hurt   kill anyone else   I won't drink with you tonight  Thanks     I feel better about the term "slip" as well    If it helps more I simplify my outlook on life to one sentence as its easy to remind myself of it whenever I feel negative in any sort of way  anger  depression  hopelessness  ect   "I am alive and human"   I am alive so every moment is important  As time on this earth is limited and its amazing that we have even this moment to appreciate  Further more within each of these moments I can literally do anything I want because I am alive and active   I remind myself that I am physically human  As emotions are mostly just chemical reactions in your brain and your body telling you how you should react and feel about things  Its a by product of our tribal days  For example if you feel down about something its mostly just your body punishing you since its not made for modern day civilization  Back in the day the body would punish you for messing up a hunt  or not finding any berries as it could endanger yourself and the tribe  So when you feel regret just remind yourself that you are human and that its just your tribal insticts making you feel that way  It doesnt mean you have to listen to them   You are human and you are alive  Oh I fucking love you   Can't wait to hear more   Night sweetie  Look up " Mod Sun "  What is your plan  What are you going to do differently this time    I will not drink today  well said  Excellent decision   Not drinking with you tonight     Yes I used it to quit and it really helped me   Like you I only took half the recommended dose because I was afraid of the side effects  per doctors orders too  I did not experience any bad side effects  Good luck  I'd have to look at the one post I actually did make  it's titled something like "Lurker repost deux"  It got mod hammered the first time I posted it because I had it titled "Lurker shitpost"  even though I gave up my lurker status a while back  I don't need verification that I'm an alcoholic  That's like the stupidest fucking shit ever  I know I'm an alcoholic  I'm just self conscious  and don't want to piss people off      I really isn't too hard   I'm a chubby ass  pale  white  redneckish dude that sounds like his family tree hasn't forked for a few generations    but I can try to help with that faps  Thank you for taking the time to read it  I needed to tell someone  I won't be drinking tonight   "Rock bottom is when you decide to stop digging   " I know the struggle  One time recently though  my brain was craving that quick fix of gratification that alcohol gives me and I had to literally sit myself down and force myself to think of something that I enjoy while sober  Like literally something that I purposefully DO NOT do while drunk because the drinking ruins it  I had to dig deep because my alcoholic brain was trying to tell me that "everything was better while drunk " Such bull    but anyways I thought about movies  Like good movies that I'm genuinely excited to watch   Personally I'm a huge horror movie fan   Watching a movie for me while drunk was so unenjoyable because I couldn't piece together the storyline and the next day I didn't remember shit  It also gave that specific movie a bad stigma because I would always associate it with "oh   ya   I seen that movie before  But I was drunk af" So I opened my laptop and got on rotten tomatoes  Made it like a fun little project to find a highly rated horror flick that I hadn't yet seen  Found one  Watched it  Enjoyed it because I followed it the whole way through and by he time the movie was done  well my nights through  it's time for bed and my brain was satisfied  This is something that personally worked for me and I just wanted to share  You've been sober for so long  such an amazing accomplishment  Don't throw it away over those crazy alcoholic brain moments that will ALWAYS result in guilt  shame  disappointment and a hangover if you give in  Will do thanks Thanks  good luck to you      I'm so sorry for your loss  Like someone else said he seemed so sure and confident that he was making the right choice in his final post  He was in much pain  and I hope he gets the rest we all deserve  is what a thing   beer worms   i dont think its a medical term  but if you've ever experienced it  you'll know what im talking about Thank you  good luck  Your not doing it wrong  Just expect general asshatery   is that a word   I have three newly opened Pabst beers I forgot about strewn about my house  Should I drink them  Probably not  Oh  I had a conversation with my mom the other day and she started crying telling me how the rum I used to drink could have made me go blind  The rum I used to drink is called Cruzan and it is still sold nationwide at liquor stores  My mother overreacts         Good luck  You got this  Advice     never have even 1 cigarette  that one cigarette always leads you back to smoking fulltime again  And I promise it gets alot easier  Don't give up  I'm glad you got it off your chest    We got this  Hi  Glad you're here with us  This is a great place to browse for insight into how others tackle sobriety  Spending as much time here as I could reading and responding to others' posts has helped me tremendously  Hope to see you around  I will not drink with you today  That is the scary part    I have no idea what my plan is    the only thing that is really different this time is that I don't even really enjoy it anymore    all through Christmas and New Years I drank every day    and I hated every minute of it   I literally didn't enjoy the moments with friends  there was no high  no relaxation   nothing    which was good I thing  because it means there is nothing to miss  I spoke to my "drinking friends" told them I want out   most of them are on the same page   I have already distanced myself from the others that I know could draw be back in earlier this year when I tried to make changes  I think my plan right now is to try and do one day at a time   Hahahahha  If you posted an intro like that without saying it was an intro  you'd fit right in  Oh dear Lord    I feel for people going to these places thinking they're finally going to get some help       How utterly ruthless   By comparison SD is a beacon of light  It took me a few weeks and some meds to start putting the depression behind me   There are still all my underlying issues to be addressed which I am tackling with a good therapist very well suited to me and my issues   Good luck  sounds like you're very much on the right track  i wan't trying to be snarky   just sometimes it really looks like worms   it's weird cause i know my 'bahoe' didn't change sizes    Did the exact same thing yesterday   Welcome   I won't drink with you today   This means so much  Thank you for grieving with me  Cliche is OK   Can you make it work  is what counts   What steps are you taking to ensure your plan becomes a reality  Thank you I will try to remember that about cravings  I'm hoping with time they will have less power  Sign me up  Wait a second  I think you posted about hot fisherman but never hairy man  I think you need to post something about hairy man  How hairy is he   Honestly    any user who knew him    knows he could never have come up with this beautiful post    I mean     really   Thank you  They have been my motivation these past few weeks  I'm so sorry   What a scary thing  I have kids as well and my drinking went from my free weekends to whenever I wanted  And it wasn't pretty  So many close calls  We are here for you  reach out whenever you need support   I won't drink with you today    LOL at "allll year "  Good for you on doing the big dump    Out of curiosity  what constitutes a slip  Even glancing at pornography  PMO  I've been doing r nofap for a while and have seen porn for brief seconds   I wish I could turn back time to this point in my "career "  I started with hydrocodone and remember vividly the first time I took a little extra and how heavenly it felt  20 years later and I am an IV heroin user  To find a vein takes me a good 15 minutes with a flashlight pressed against my skin to help my find one  I've moved to shooting in my breasts because there isn't much else left  I developed severe pneumonia due to decreased respiratory functions from nodding off all the time  My life revolves around heroin  I have no friends  no hobbies  no joy except getting high  And the worst part is  it's nowhere near that first time I took a few too many vicodin and lay in euphoric bliss for hours  Not  Even  Close  Get out while you're ahead  Run and never look back   One of the great things about making posts on SD is that we can always go back and re read them   Sort of like an online journal   Hope you get things healed up soon   If you are in Canada  as your username suggests   you might want to check out the documentary linked below  I found it helpful in understanding some of my behaviours and it showed me that a little forgiveness goes a long way in changing long formed habits   Good luck    http   www cbc ca doczone m episodes slaves to habit   Sorry to anyone outside of Canada  I am pretty sure our national broadcaster will block you from watching this    When the fight left me  I surrendered  Best thing I ever did     My surrender may look different from yours   What do you need to do that you haven't done before    Fuckin' hell it's cringe worthy   Here   https   www reddit com r cripplingalcoholism comments 5hu2n6 lurker repost deux   Hell  you even commented in it  This  I think an important thing to realize is that the younger people on this sub  and in the world  are the first generation to be able to access high quality hardcore porn this easily  I don't think this is so much of a free speech issue as it is exploring uncharted territory in public health policy  I like his quote in the article  "It's not government coming in and saying what you can and can't watch  It's just basically a message to the pornography industry that if someone in Utah can prove damages from the product  that they may be held liable financially " Of course  you'll have the libertarian argument that it's up to the people to protect themselves from the internet and that the fault here is on the parents allowing their children to access such material  not the corporations  And that's a valid argument seeing as one of the last things I want is to see the internet become exceedingly regulated  but I also strongly believe that these porn companies are preying on the developing sexuality of young kids  especially young boys  because there's no way that they don't know that a significant subset of their audience is underage  It's a really gray issue that there isn't an easy solution to  Good for you     I divorced during sobriety  he's been out of my home for closing on a year  and I'm still not dating   I still have a lot of work to do on myself   YMMV  Thank you  I will watch this tonight   I understand all of this  Thanks for sharing  We can do this  Please post an update I guess you have to ask yourself what sober means to you  Do you have a problem with marijuana  Are you using it to escape  Do you use it occasionally or often  Does marijuana cause problems in your life  or have the potential to  fail test lose a job  etc     Just some things to consider  I wouldn't have a problem with you claiming sobriety in AA if you're booze free and your marijuana use is very casual    Only you know the true answer to your question  You're just coming off a couple months of binge drinking  being tired even after four days is not completely unexpected   Please be gentle with yourself  and go see a doctor if you're worried  Just saw this  this is my alt account   Hope everything is okay  I'd like to know what your stance is on NoPorn and NoFap since you also partake in StopGaming  genuine curiosity  Thank you  Congratulations  Dean  I will not drink with you today  Man  this is a great post  I feel like I'm looking into a mirror  Thanks so much for sharing and I wish you great luck in your journey   It's alright  My first post here was about getting a case of the farts while on a date to the symphony  People comment on how fancy I was  There's a great quote from a series that seems a tad bit related  "When you can't run  you crawl  and when you can't crawl   when you can't do that    you find someone to carry you  "  All of you folks at SD have certainly helped carry me  This guy has a way of talking down to people  That holier than thou attitude would get his clock cleaned in my neighborhood  Early on sometimes I just took it hour by hour  I cleaned a lot  pounded cans of fizzy water  ate ice cream almost every night  and read here obsessively  I did whatever it took to go to bed sober and woke up every morning grateful that I hadn't drank the night before  It got better with time and I learned new ways to cope with the things that were driving my drinking  12 days is awesome  hang in there  I'll not drink with you today  Thank you  I needed to hear all of this     Hot fisherman has been ongoing for a month or so    God he has an incredible body   big shoulders and massive arms and   well big everything   And such a flirt   I'm thoroughly attracted   but he lives about about an hour and a half away   Hairy man is very recent   We've yet to go on a first date as I'm exploring this further   But he sent me a selfie and he's very hairy    Lol   But he's funny and sweet and sexy and romantic   Also lives closer and works even closer   Great job  couple of homes  lots of vacation   He has potential and he really wants to meet me   I did send him a couple of risky pics   nothing worse than I posted in r cagonewild but I was a little buzzed and feeling a little frisky and he was too   I have a date with hot fisherman this Thursday and with hairy man for Friday so I'll probably have to make a decision soon but we'll see   I don't want to rush anything   I do love men though   Lol Yeah   Badges are dope  One day at a time is a great place to start  It helped me to have something to  read  https   www reddit com r stopdrinking comments 17hwpk for those struggling with the label alcoholic and   that reminded me why I could never go back to what I was doing    I actively avoided people and places that i knew might tempt me into drinking again  This included the grocery store and any and all stores after work   I changed my routine to occupy the extra sober time I suddenly had    I found alternatives to my evening cocktails to help me relax    I put a lot of thought into what I would do when I was thinking about drinking    Nothing changes if nothing changes  It wasn't enough to just stop drinking  I had to be proactive about changing myself for the better  because that's the only thing I truly control in this life  Like super fucking hairy   dark thick hair   body hair I mean   He's losing it on top  I live with two smokers  When I see them smoking I know why they are smoking and why I am not  They are weak and chained to a drug and they don't know they could quit at any moment  Nicotine doesn't solve your problems  instead adds more problems and keep you away from solving those already existing  It'll take a while to get yourself togheter without nicotine  keep going  remember it's for your health and always remember YOU CAN DO IT  Thank you all for this sub    I join you in not drinking  Tell them it's about money  Quitting is the biggest raise I ever received    Or tell them a friend made a bet with you    You could be honest or lie  Say whatever makes you feel good  Besides  it's no one else's business   Maybe  if you don't mind a bit of diabeetus YAY        I'm happy for you man  I'm past a week off the stuff now  unfortunately I don't feel good yet  I still have no motivation or hope for myself  Seriously considering going back on it but I'm scared  I really don't know what to do  I need help   if i was gonna break into immediate shepherding  I don't know if I'd try in Asia   Seems like you could maybe chill in Belize while you brush up on your spanish then maybe walk down to Uruguay   Sorry you're on paper   that shit is heartburn you have to pay for  I feel you my friend  i'm here again  day 1  can see the shame in my post history too  i'll not make a new account this time   Feeling ashamed because i told everyone i would stop for sure this time  dealt with 2 months of suffering  anger  sadness  sleep issues  etc just to fall back again to the spiral    Be strong my friend  we know the exit route  we just need to follow it and life will be better  I've been there  spent more than a year sober  it was just easy not having to worry about weed and the negatives side effects  i promise you we will be fine    Good luck and lets be strong  Now is that hair where you would expect or is it more like "Oh my god  I didn't know hair could grow there " I'm sorry    Hey  feelings are real   It's okay to feel bitter or angry right now  You don't need to change everything at once  It sounds like you've got a lot on your plate right now    you've done well reaching out  Someone told me at my first meeting to try at least 6   Same meeting or different ones    To give it a chance   I had to force myself to go and it was hard  I felt dumb for needing help and like I could do it myself  I'm so glad I forced myself to keep trying  there is a lot of wisdom in the rooms of Al Anon   you can take what you like and leave the rest    Good luck tomorrow    Sign me up  Great response to a great post     In my drinking days I would have determined that the desk needed to be raised   Sheesh  Congrats on your year    I have found that spending time on here helps me a lot  I haven't been on here much as of late  and I can feel everything kinda slipping    not doing my to do lists anymore  not hitting the gym at all  eating like crap    snowball effect for me   So I am back with the DCI everyday  signed up for quotes on Saturdays  and go in the chat room at critical times     My badge reflects the amount of days I've gone without consuming alcohol  Your badge is yours to do with whatever you want though    I choose to be honest with myself about what my goal here is  For me  that is 100  no consumption of alcohol  If I consciously put alcohol in my mouth  I would reset   Not resetting would mean I was trying to avoid the consequences of my actions  I will not drink with you today  Tonight is a little tough for me for some reason  too  Asked the SO to grab me some LaCroix on his way home    I've never heard the term "brown out" before your post  I've never had a blackout  but I've definitely had brown outs as Urban Dictionary describes them  where you don't recall something unless someone brings it up  Either way  scary stuff  Glad you're okay  Glad you're here  I think communities like these are essential to keep us all on the track Thanks for your post man  i truly appreciate  I've felt like you one day too  being sober after years of abuse  not worrying about weed is just so good  I'll pursue this path and hopefully make a post like yours in the future  No one understands what 'i'  going through  When I talk I feel even more alienated and alone and they're denying my feelings   '  Oh  I feel that way too  Everyone does  Or some bullshit platitude  addiction isn't temporary  Porn and fap are death    I'm middle aged and I've got good boners and decent sexual endurance   Or    if I fap  my erections are about the quality I imagine an 80 year old man has    Given the above  tt's not even hard for me to go NoFap and NoPorn  It's like my ability to abstain from lighting my hair on fire      And  philosophically  if you're a young man and still have boners of steel regardless of fap or not  I'd still strongly suggest avoiding both    There's a philosophy that you might want to provide yourself sexual outlet prior to a first date with a new young lady  or guy  whatever  in order to make good decisions  If you have a strong libido  I think that is certainly a valid option  Let's get real  some guys can get real rapey or at least creepy after a long dry spell  Even then  I'd suggest you avoid porn during the deed  and think of a woman from memory instead of consuming adult media   Www yourbrainonporn com  go there  Learn  My GP recommended a therapist who specialized in anxiety disorders and had a background in substance abuse  I ended up really liking her  which was lucky   don't feel bad if you don't 'click' with a therapist right away  different ones have different styles  I also know people who have found good therapists through the google  Most will include information about what sorts of problems they specialize in  Good luck  For me  sex drive and all that is different from gaming  I can easily not jerk off or anything for a week if I want  Also  porn never is really addictive for me  not to get too specific  because after I  finish  my drive becomes super low and everything seems stupid and I want to go back to work  Obviously  I need to see these pics and approve of them  Ha   Anyway  I'm reminded of this   https   youtu be l5aZJBLAu1E 3 I'm really happy to hear you're going for it   I can see how a plan could be helpful  I had to just dive in head first with the idea that I can not drink any more  That being said   I've had some good feedback from others   probably the best bit of advice has been   just take it one day at a time  Best of luck on the mission  It's not easy  but it's worth every bit of effort and sacrifice   Woo hoo     Just asked the SO to stop by the store on his way home and get me my LaCroix  The LaCroix must flow   Glad you're having a better night  anomnamedica  I will not drink with you tonight  except for the LaCroix  that is  D Cheers  I similarly disengaged from life  and I share your sentiments exactly   Taking small steps in what I hope is the right direction   Thanks for your post  Thanks  Just what I needed to read after work   I like getting on a crowded bus or subway car and not being the guy who smells like smoke anymore  We all believe we had it under control until the moment of clarity when the evidence was too overwhelming to deny   If everything is so good why are you doing IV heroin  I'm pretty sure the vast majority of people with good lives don't do heroin    The physical addiction is obvious but there is probably a deeper reason you can't go more than a week  Find out what that reason is and do something about it before that moment of clarity comes from a life altering event   Dot be sorry  That's awesome  It's like a blanket from the neck down   I find it fascinating and I really want to touch it     My latest lover had no body hair at all   My narc douchbag ex that fucked the last year of my life was really hairy but it was reddish blonde so it didn't show much   I apparently have no set type whatsoever   They are all so different and yet attracted to all   Oh and hot fisherman is smooth everywhere   His body is the one I'm most turned on by   I love big chest and shoulders and arms   Where they can just throw you around     Mmm Good for you    sounds like you figured out a system that works for you  I tried the lope but it didn't seem to do anything for me  Although I felt so shitty that I doubt anything would've helped me  Good luck  Thank you   Good point  I'm not middle aged  I'm 16 so I never have issues  However  I don't really like to watch porn these days as there is some weird stuff  And it gets slightly addictive to find weirder things and all but that's to explain later  If you have to ask then you already know the answer  And also  if you plan to go the whole year then I suggest you stop reading incest stories  Eliminate all temptations  be honest and discipline yourself  The thing is  for most of us cold turkey is the only way  When you accept weed your mind start to tell you that its ok to smoke a little bit  then a little bit more  and then you're in full addiction mode again  God  for me even after months sober  accepting the idea of smoking one time is enough to put me in the state where i'll be smoking more and more till addiction  I have to agree with this Pearl  Once I was at a certain point  tapering was actually MUCH harder than stopping  The last week or so of my taper was rough and such a complete mind game   Today's Day 8 for me  and one of the first I've been tempted to have a glass of wine   But I won't drink with you today  I  think  it was  I don't know much  but from what I gather things were  are   in the super early stages   as in talking to   find   a professional  and a suitable rehab stages       I'm laying low  hoping that a professional is involved  or will be soon  and can get things back on track       That's also part of my frustration  I love my girlfriend's mom  but she hasn't been involved in any AlAnon  NarAnon  or therapy   so I'm not sure she's equipped to go about doing this the way it should be done  I wish she'd looped me in sooner   not only so I hadn't made this mistake  but because I feel I know a bit more about the process  could have reached out to NarAnon friends and my therapist for advice  etc   etc  Feels like she kinda went rogue   agreed  This works better for me than AA personally  but I have gone to a handful of those meetings as well  Wow sounds like an anxiety attack  Try staying way from the coffee  One time I had a panic attack so bad I had to pull the car over  You might want to see a psychiatrist for medication  To get some relief  Good luck It's different for different people  I was a heavy smoker for over a decade and when I quit last April it took me over 4 months before my short term memory improved  You might try some B vitamin supplements  they seemed to help me  Exercise is also a good way to get your entire system back on track   I was happy to share   thanks for reading  It's great to hear that it is offering some encouragement to you  Great post   Stay strong my friend  I'm the same boat   Never got in trouble drinking and my personal life is fine   But fine is not good enough   Who can keep the resolve to train after a night of craft beers  And the hangovers get worse and worse with age   Truth is I'm pushing 39 and enough is enough   I want to be around to see my kids grow up  I won't drink with you today   Thank you  Reading my post back it does make it sound like I plan on jumping right back in when in actuality it probably won't be for some time   I write down on the board when their next med is due and when their next PRN that they qualify for is available   It tends to help a little with the leaning on the call bell issue because I can remind them to look at the clock and that I am unable to give them additional Meds until then    Thank you for all the support   Im not drinking at all tonight and will get back on it   My girlfriend and I just got into an argument because Ive been miserable all day and shes sick of it   Its not worth it    What are ya thinking about for day one        I  kinda had my eyes on mine  Jan 2 like all newbies I guess  for a couple of weeks and I told myself I do a good job of really tapering it down ha ha     So for me it's only day two but aside from not sleeping I'm actually feeling really good     Hope you are soon  as well     You're young  Don't start down pornography  It's an addiction waiting to happen    The Mind on Porn  https   www youtube com watch v 7oFVOJf0TzY   Inform and educate yourself   http   www yourbrainonporn com    In my experience  I heal faster when I don't drink   I wish you speedy healing  Glad to hear that things are going better  and that you've secured a supply of LaCroix  Have a great night  fizzy water cheers  I felt the same exact way    was seriously suicidal  thinking what's the point of even living anymore  Three weeks of these bullshit symptoms will do that to just about anyone    not just you  The great news is you are literally about to be to the point where you realize it was all worth it  The day for me was day 22    I remember it clearly  Woke up with a totally different outlook on life and it's steadily improved ever so slightly everyday since then  I'm on day 41 today and feel pretty damn good  It'll get better for you very soon  I guarantee you  Keep grinding mate  It's not going to be like that for the rest of your life man  you've been sober for 4 months so i presume you know that  But yea  it sucks  i'm feeling the same way   Stay strong my friend A lot of people will probably tell you that you should not go    Assuming you ignore their advice  if you want to go on this trip and not drink  you're going to have to tell your sister well in advance that you're not going to be drinking    This isn't a random coworker that saw you wasted at the last office Christmas party and is now mildly curious that you're only drinking seltzer water at the office happy hour  This is your sister who is expecting to party with you  and based on what you've described she will instantly start badgering you  You're not going to last an entire vacation casually not drinking unless you're very clear about your intentions       I have not completely quit drinking yet  However   the depression and anxiety get worse and worse with each hangover that I have  Its just not worth it anymore   Good luck to you  Sounds like you have a kick ass and supportive family    that's something to be extremely grateful for  Amazing stuff  The people in recovery are truly amazing people  Irregardless of ur age  ethnic background or whatever  we all have a uniting bond that is stronger than most  to help each other stay alive   Keep up the good fight  It's so worth it  We're here if you need  Thank you   Made a commitment to abstain from pornography and masturbation this new year   I've abstained in the past from PMO and longest streak has been 6 months  Perspective  am 21 and since a young age high speed internet pornography has been available   I remember what it was like when I was "sober"   I put that in air quotes as it seems ridiculous to use the word   anyway  "sober" of PMO  it was like being on a emotional clarity mental high  Crazy  Exactly   To build upon this thought   I was always fighting my drinking with things like moderation  and how'd that work out for me     Once I finally came to accept that there was no way to beat alcohol in a fair fight   I walked away from it   There was something peaceful in that     I'm 16 so I never have issues   Even at 16  I had some issues with keeping it up with condoms on  I'm betting NoFap would have helped with that       I don't really like to watch porn these days as there is some weird stuff  And it gets slightly addictive   You just said addictive  so cut it out  The difference between working on skills learning talents teambuilding now and spending your free time on porn can wind up costing you  20K in income per year down the road  Maybe more   Addiction to anything that doesn't require hard work to achieve a sense of accomplishment brings you down   And  yeah  if you're going from normal porn with attractive young women in it to porn with people doing weird  weird things in it    that's your sign you're gone too far  Don't think that watching unspeakable depravity isn't going to leave you feeling bored with the kinds of situations you will find yourself in during your sexual lifetime  It will    It will also leave you with some unrealistic expectations  etc    Best to look at porn like    once to satisfy your curiosity  and then leave it alone   And  since you're a minor  I have to officially tell you that you should wait until you are of lawful age to do so  LOL    although in the smart phone era  I know how deaf your ears will be to that  Please  please  please whatever you do  do not isolate yourself  I know reaching out  being social  even speaking at all feels utterly impossible right now  But find something or someone to avoid isolation        Therapy is ideal  but you may need time to be ready   you may want to start and talk about everything   except   him  Find an AlAnon meeting and go   you don't have to talk  just go sit among people who have been through what you've been through  just an hour a week   or more if you feel up to it  Go sit in a park where people are  Choose a friend or family member who can just come sit quietly and watch tv  or go to a movie   no talking     Post here  as often as you want need  Post on other subs that interest you  Shit  PM me   I won't even respond if you prefer   Yak herding sucks in Mongolia  There are no liquor stores for miles around  I'm 12 years in  going on 13  I had 3 years not included in this that I made it off and on  I had to substitute it  I did that by exercising which in the end became an addiction and still is  But  during those 3 years I felt at my best and looked my best  But what I remember is the feeling that I conquered it and for that moment I had beat it  God  that felt good  It didn't last  I found myself wanting to puke like an addict wants to shoot up  Why is it so hard to stop  I met a woman that had made it 9 years  She was an inspiration to me  when I made it those 3 years off and on she had told me that loving who you are is so important  I did  maybe I don't now  I wish I could sit back and say it's gotten easier but it hasn't  I feel like I've been sucked in further to this disease  I guess after my rant my advice is be honest  get out before you find yourself so far in  I wish I could hug every young woman on here and really make them see how beautiful they are  Also  read  Read about recovery but not just from bulimia  anorexia but addiction  I may not be there but I want to be  I want there to be hope  Even though I don't know you  I want you to know you're beautiful  Inside and out and what you see as a flaw is jyst you  Hard to say since I can't follow it myself but I swear that every person I meet with disease has so much beauty  I feel their beauty  Recover sweetheart  defeat the disease  Don't let it suck you in    5 days is HUGE  It's all mental from here on out  Stay strong  it's so worth it   Edit  fixed   to 5  Thank you  I appreciate the advice  I'm enjoying my fizzy water right now    And I will not drink with you today     I feel a bit stronger every time I get through a small test of my resolve and come out sober on the other side  Thank you  Will give both a go  Love you too Fap   I'll never be able to decide on these men   Lol And I didn't mean to say it's only women  It's men to that also deal with this   In sobriety I avoid all mind altering substances unless prescribed or recommended by a doctor  including supplements like St  John's Wort and stuff   MJ was recommended to me as a less problematic alternative to heavy narcotics for chronic pain control   I still call myself sober  but I don't use the word "clean"  not that I ever really did    It's been about two years now   No desire to drink still   Of course  I was 27 years sober when it was recommended   I's strongly discourage anyone with say  less than 15 years sober  I have a friend who will use the gif of Nicholas Cage gleefully filling his shopping cart in Leaving Las Vegas  Each time I see it I have to catch myself from thinking how much fun that must be    before I realize he's willingly signing his own death certificate  You're not alone   No experience with Chantix  Just wanted to say welcome  Stay strong we're all here going through it with you as well  If they're capped I'd try to remove one and see if it has that hiss bottles have with different pressure   I'd drink it  but I'd also chase it with a pint of whiskey  cravings will always be there  I find that if I eat somethinf it makes them pass    I also just remind myself that its a dopomene thing  and that I can learn to control a chemical problem    that its not something mysterious that cant be cracked   good luck traveller     I can't even begin to tell you the shit storm that you're in for if you continue to use this green sludgy crap  It will get worse and worse until you eventually become an absolute slave to it  There's no escaping it  If someone tells you otherwise  they just haven't reached the breaking point yet  It completely robbed me on four years of my life and 10's of thousands of dollars   congrats   and caffeine free  wow I'm right here with you   I was a daily smoker in my early twenty's and quit for a career opportunity   That was the big motivator for the first time I quit    Eight years ago I rediscovered weed when I moved to California and used it to help curb my drinking    Last year I gave up alcohol and became dependent on a very strong edible losenge which I took nightly to help get to sleep    This time around I have no big motivator other than I just want to start dreaming again and get my life in order   I let my prescription expire last month and made it a New Years resolution to quit for good this time  but old habits die hard   Thanks for sharing your stories  it really helps to know I'm not the only person going through these emotions   It is very difficult especially with those whose friends and family aren't exactly cheering for my recovery    That's really strange  no one else is having trouble viewing it that I have heard of    what browser are you using  Something similar happened to me not that long ago  Scared me real bad  the idea of what I could have done to myself or others  It makes one think real hard  I'm here not drinking with you for sure  not trying to say pebbles and pond scum are mutually exclusive  but there's gotta be some kinda toilet physics that governs strata   i know im rambling  but i wouldn't ever taste poop   i NASCAR around buttholes all the time so I dont feel the need to actually eat shit  literally     If it is  10 10 performance  And what of it  Real or fake  it's nothing you have to be offended over  I hope this feeling will vanish  the day isn't over yet  Congrats for you 64 smoke free days     I agree with you  It's not like a pack of cigarettes  I just put the stuff away too   Wow  that is tough  I'm new here  but you're in my thoughts  Stay strong  I'll not drink with you today    yeah  nicotine patches do give wild dreams  Keep a journal  you'll get a good laugh in a couple of months  even if it feels like shit now  Right there with you man  I'm about 20 days in  It's like I'm bored and I don't enjoy anything  I feel like I'm just passing the time till I pass my test for my new job then prob go back to smoking  I honestly feel like if I could regulate it I would be better off  I don't really like drinking and I feel like it's unfair that I can't do what I love  Just pisses me off really   Welcome back  Keep it up  You've got this Ah  I've been wondering about this pink cloud too  I'm reading This Naked Mind but haven't reached that part yet  And suddenly  it all makes sense    my pink cloud has vanished    Scurries back to read This Naked Mind  Damn are euro per can beers the cheapest  For a buck you can usually get some pretty decent stuff in the united states   30 50 cents for dirt cheap Natty   Keystone  60 80 cents for cheap bud   coors  1 dollar can get you some stella   sam adams  Sorry about this post  I just had to get this off my chest      No need to be sorry  Best of luck this time around Way to go  Have you looked into The Sinclair method  I've never tried it myself  but I've heard it works wonders with cravings  You should check out this TEDx talk about it  https   youtu be 6EghiY s2ts Day three for me    Last night I tossed and turned from 11pm until 2am and then  knowing I wouldnt get back to sleep I got outta bed and cooked a dijourno and had some late night pizza   After that I finally became tired and fell asleep   I'm a big believer in New Years resolutions   Last year I gave up alcohol  only to become a major dabber in 2016   Saying goodbye to my crutch is more difficult than quitting drinking for me    That's great  but don't be shocked if it goes back up  Mine was all over the place the first month  Great job sticking to just the pet store  and congrats on day 2  Parrots seem so cool  but sound like a lot of work     mostly  i was saying i dig licking chick's buttholes  but i'd never eat poop   the other part was me typing cause im bored    That was hard to read because I felt for you  for how hard it must have been to write and how badly you must be feeling  It was also hard to read because I've been IN THAT EXACT SAME CIRCUMSTANCE  except my tire blowout ended up with me in handcuffs  I've also been that person in the hot tub  falling over  that person who brought too much champagne and drank it all    and then more  I know all too well that crushing feeling of remorse on the inside when you're trying to laugh off the previous night's exploits on the outside  You're not alone  We are here with you  We get it  We understand and we're willing to help  if that's what you want    There are two books in particular    The 30 Day Sobriety Solution  and  This Naked Mind  that have transformed me from a three decade high functioning  successful professional with a family on the outside yet degenerate  pathetic drunk on the inside into someone on his 40th day sober  longest since 9th grade  with an incredibly bright outlook on life    Again  I can't tell you how much I associated with almost every word of your post  Thanks for coming here to let us hear it  You're helping us as much as we're able to hopefully help you   Sounds like a good time  congrats on 7 days  I'll not drink with you tonight  Sign me up please  I've been smoking for 20 years  started when I was 13  I have had a few breaks as well but it has been a constant for most of my life   I am on day 3    still a long road ahead but nice to see fellow long timers are on the same journey   I'm going to stay away from games for all of January 2017  I found a loophole in one of the apps I used to block myself from gaming several days ago  but I think I patched it up so I can't get around it  I was doing really well before that happened  and I believe I can continue to do well for the rest of this month  Happy Birthday and congrats on 7 days    You'll feel great tomorrow morning  too  with no hangover to pay for       Thanks  This is hard  But we can do this  youre right  Thanks  all  for the replies   Means a lot   It's hard to believe anyone could understand what this feels like  since nobody in my physical presence could probably relate  but oh so comforting to know I'm not alone  that others have been through this  persevered   and  recovered   Because this is a seriously lonely state to exist in   I am holding out full confidence that this will pass relatively soon   Staying true to the plan   Thank God for this sub and all you fine folk  Thanks for this post  I've heard others say the same thing  I'm looking forward to not drinking being the norm for me  It is hard  But you are strong  You can do it  We can  I keep telling myself to stop lying to myself  I dont really want to smoke  regardless of these stomach gripping cravings Thank you     Sounds like anxiety  Exercise  meditation  eating right    all that stuff really does help  And if you try it  and it doesn't work  maybe visiting a doctor or trying CBT  cognitive behavioural therapy   one of the few scientifically backed forms of therapy        Anxiety has fucked my sleep for years  and I used to use weed to fix it  just like you  Now I'm on a small dose of anti anxiety meds and it helps me sleep  Last night I had a dream that me and some random dudes had to get across 2km of water in an upside down dog house with 2 old mattresses floating behind us  A lot better than the nightmares  In my experience  the real fight starts after two weeks  Don't underestimate the addiction  It will catch you when you least expect it   Ha  My friends said they might need help again tonight and then never called  Phew  Now that you reminded me  Imma take a pill before my bubble bath  I want some immediate relief and this pbr ain't gon do it  Exactly    I actually penned a "break up" letter to booze in the earlier days of getting sober  It was really helpful to think of alcohol as an "ex" from an unhealthy relationship  I know  I'm terrified and thrilled all at the same time  No nuts in tissues   record currently stands at 3 for 3  I am extremely grateful the police didn't come  It would have been career ending for me  This also helps impress the importance of quitting for good  I cannot lose my job  especially with a DUI charge  I'd never find another one  I'm sorry that you didn't have the same luck I did  thank you for sharing your experience  I don't want to keep pushing my luck any more  And only and hour into finding this sub and I'm very hopeful for the future  I'm laying in bed with my water with no urge at all  I'm praying this feeling lasts    But I know if it doesn't I now have ears to vent to and avenues to prevent relapse   I will definitely be getting those books  Thank you and I won't be drinking with you tonight   I remember the post   I'm sorry that you had to suffer through this   I wish I could just be a normie   I'm not some special snowflake   I'm just yet another drunk trying to stay sober so I don't hurt my family anymore and break their hearts   Not sure how much more they can take   You stuck around and kept trying and that's the most wonderful thing in the world because I'll I do is keep praying that my loved ones won't give up on me while I figure this out  Very sorry to hear that  Too be quite frank with you I find instant physical and mental relief from the herbs  So this quitting has been a suckfest off and on for the last month  Start  stop  start again and stop again  Quitting has definitely made my anger go to the next level of hate  I could punch someone's lights out at an instance   genetic not much I can do about that  It's the real reason why I found relief in the herbs to begin with The downside of smoking for decades is that its reaching a point that's f'ing with me on many levels   I don't think there are any easy answers for the long haul  Despite what the noobs think  Good luck    I too have relapsed twice in the last 40ish days   I agree that finding sober friends and sober activities is a big help   I've struggled to end the relationships with those I've drank with in the past   Especially with those people being friends of both myself and my wife   Work and school have helped me stay sober Sun    Thurs  and a busy Saturday morning helps me survive Friday   Saturday nights have been my biggest struggle and sober friends are what I'm looking for to help  Happy birthday  and congrats on 7 days  Being hangover free after a birthday is a big win in my book  Over here not drinking with you     i've never eaten poop   my closest experience with poop other than my own or a pet's was when i put my finger in this girl's butthole and recreated that scene from ET where the fingers touched   And one time i gave head to a 300LB black woman in her car and she mighta wiped backed to front     i gots tons of drinking songs   Which kinda music do you like   I have two trackers  the one on SD is my current sober streak  and I have another on a habit app that tracks the days  that I have been sober over all  so it works out a percentage  like 90  over the last 6 months   Its your badge  but to me the fact I'd have to reset my SD badge is a deterrent from drinking even a couple occasionally   Your story has made me cry  I'm a woman who is in a very similar situation to you  Drink has caused all the problems or certainly been a major contributory factor to all of the problems in my life  Health  relationships  mental health  All damaged  I had a terrible Christmas and New Year  Through drinking I ruined it on the whole family  I threw them out of my house and attacked my husband  The next day I had no memory of 95  if what I said or did  I did exactly the same thing new year's day  This time total blackout  My husband is afraid if me  He told me  I'm out of control when I drink  I went to my first meeting yesterday  And cried because they all seemed so "normal" and were so kind to me  And I honestly don't deserve it  So I didn't drink yesterday   And I'm going to another meeting today to make sure I won't drink today  I'm terrified of everything  But I'm taking it one day at a time and hoping I can make amends eventually  Good luck to you   This is my opinion and my opinion only    That is YOUR badge  Not MY badge or anyone else's badge  It represents something different to each one of us so the choice to reset is yours  I will say that  for me  when I reset I too asked myself "do I need to reset "  The first thing that jumped to my mind was the old saying "if you have to ask   "  Again  for me  MY badge is about honesty and accountability to myself  I suggest trusting your gut instinct about what to do badge wise and congratulations on coming back to SD  I will not drink with you today   How is everyone doing so far   Sometimes it's good to learn from other people's mistakes  And since you have the rational side of your brain trying to tell you something  here's one more thing that it should tell you  namely  that the good times don't last forever   I'm only three days in  but I'm still very committed   I look at the past eight years of intense usage and try to see a reflection of the person I was before all of this   It's easier if you already have no close friends to lose  or have the support of your family   If things get really bad  I've told myself I will attend an AA meeting before using again   I hate AA meetings so that keeps me in check   Perhaps try meeting some new people on a dating website    If you rewrite your profile idicating that you've recently given up the habit perhaps you'll find the love of your life who is also going through the same deal  Are you fucking high     Where do you see indentations in paragraphs anymore   Books   yes but correspondence definitely not  The Naked Mind is available for free on the right hand side of this page  fuck Happy Birthday  and cheers to not drinking  Kratom is such a weird ass drug  It really does do some crazy shit to your brain to keep you reeled in  So much more psychologically addictive than it is physical  Really crazy plant this stuff is    I    no BS read on some forum somewhere  can't remember but think it was bluelight before I found Reddit  this dude had been an ex IV heroine addict for years and swore up and down that it was tougher for him to come off of kratom than it was heroine  It obviously affects everyone differently but damn  The fact he even compared the two was an eye opener to me  I'm interested to see what all they come up with while researching it in the future  It's a very unique plant that's for damn sure  Yeah  that's true about the false bravado   That is something I'm going to have to really watch for    Glad to hear your BP is moving in the right direction  Not OP  but Neely's and Edley's are both good  If you are in Nashville  though  you have to go for hot chicken  Or reinvision the anxiety not as a withdrawal  but the real you buried deep down inside is finally awakening   Remember  enlightenment isn't a journey upward  but a journey inward    You bet  just remember  Willpower only gets someone so far  and once the din of the hangover fades away and someone starts feeling good again  the allure of the drink comes back with a fury  Be ready for that    I hear you also on the DUI  I thank God that by the time I got it I was self employed and that I had a good attorney  Had it been a few years earlier my ass would have been toast  not that I shouldn't have gotten 2 447 of them previously   You can fuck right off  Grab yourself a badge  you've come to the right place  Not drinking with you tonight   This reward mentality drove a lot of my weekday drinking  I had a hard day I deserve a glass of wine  Which turned into the bottle  Every  Time  I now realize it was boredom because my kids were in bed and I was alone  So now I make myself go to bed with a glass of water so I'm not alone in a big room tempted to drink because I'm not ready for bed  etc etc all the dumb rationalization  Booze isn't a reward  it just fucks up the next morning and a million other things  Here's to new thinking   Okay  now I see the link on the side that has the free copy  Before I was clicking on the "Books" link and there it doesn't show the freebie  Now I sound like my mother  Thank you  Congrats on 16  I'm on day 65 and was experiencing the same thing till I listened to this hypnosis recording to get rid of depression  I was totally skeptical but it did the trick    https   youtu be c2s2bVWWu7A  Just lay down  Close your eyes  Put on headphones  And follow along  Only 20 minutes long   Wish me luck on the no pukey  Haven't eaten recently  so I should be good    Right  I agree and do not actually want the drama to continue  I have since just not been back to dine at that restaurant as I knew I wouldn't be able to handle the combination of him being there and the restaurant being busy  When it's calmer  I can go and either he'll no longer work there or I'll be able to just sit back and relax    When it came to my birthday dinner  I didn't know he worked there until after we had sat    and like I said  I took it as my "freebie" to be a little vindictive  But in general  I do not want to continue being vindictive  Hmm I do not know much about tianeptine wd  How long does it last for  You've been clean for a month  so I'd think it'd be mostly past you  Then again  you used it for 4 years and it has ssri aspects to it which take longer to heal from  I would definitely stick to kratom as it is the safer choice  Taper off of your current dose  Just know that since you feel shitty right now  that means your body is repairing and every second you spend in pain is progress and will get better shortly  Try and stick at your small kratom dose for a week  Then taper off it slowly  It seems like you are on small enough dose just to keep you functional  but also make progress in withdrawals  Kratom contains many of immunostimulant alkaloids so it may help your flu cold from tianeptine    But also implement healthy diet  rest  meditation  hot baths saunas  green tea  vitamins and exercise once the flu is gone  Start small like a brisk walk  But first get plenty of rest and sleep and healthy food teas until your body can handle exercise  Maybe just try and relax by watching a bunch of tv or reading a book  drinking tea and soup  Distract the mind while the body heals  Keep us updated  Congrats on all the time you've been off gaming so far  That's awesome     Good job  You've got this     aw fuck you kinda got me   I do like metal  but it's on the fringes of my tastes   let me think about this one   And we're talking about real metal and not just hardcore  right   I'm here with you  I'll be on day 3 tomorrow  We can do it     and i bet iron maiden is cheating      she kinda went rogue   Family members mean no harm and they care  but if not handled well  an intervention can "blow up" and make things worse  Someone who is familiar with recovery options and the intervention process should be coordinating it    Paws takes more addicts from us then anything  Both in Relapse and the more dangerous GIVING UP ON LIFE    The hopeless feelings  the RLS  Not sleeping for WEEKS which drives you mad  Those are the things people need to be afraid of  not the flu like symptoms of Acute   Sad thing is it is not really talked about  I had been in group for a while before I was able to put a name to what I was struggling with   Like you  I went the medically assisted route as well  But Yak Herding in NJ   Totally the tits   It's pretty common   I had bad headaches for the first 8 days   Not migraine level  but bad enough to annoy the shit out of me  I didn't get that impression  Maybe it's his accent or regional speech patterns that put you off  Good video  regardless  Who's been watching basic cable this afternoon  I jumped on my healthcare website    I'm so glad I went     3 months ago changed my life no regrets  Wish you the best   My recovery does not include marijuana  The problem is  if you are addicted to one drug  such as alcohol  and use others  you are likely to become addicted to those  also  Yes  even pot   You are also strong for coming here and opening up  I am also starting out in this journey of sobriety  but coming here daily will support my choice  I will not drink with you tonight   Yeah those THC pills can hit you hard   I usually feel great after I puke though   Kind of like when we used to party with GHB   Just gotta get that one good puke out of the way  Bentyl aka docyclomine will not prolong wd by any means  Even immodium won't effect progress  You are a strong and smart for taking this opportunity  in your schedule to quit  Once the first 2 weeks are done  it's smooth sailing  Just be prepared for the mental games after the first week  And I don't think your family shoukd beat you up much  Kratom is way more mild than heroin  They should be glad you didn't fall back into that  Kratom helps the cravings and keeps you functional  Yeah you messed up  but it's a huge improvement from where you were before  Take care man I will not drink with you today  Thanks  I'll look into it  yeah  I'm aware my insurance won't pay for Thailand  but my out of pocket max under my plan    which I would have to pay before benefits kick in    is  7150  just a bit less than what I'd be paying for a month in Thailand anyway   Basic cable  I wish  I pay over  200 for my Comcast obsession  I need to cut the cord  If my shoe fits Checking in  To me  sobriety is a state of mind  not just abstaining from drugs an alcohol  In my opinion  I can not maintain a sober state of mind  body and spirit if I am consuming any mind or mood altering substances  I have an extremely addictive personality and while it's been in remission for more than four years now  I can not allow any substances that I might be able to abuse to reignite my obsession to use    But that's just my experience and what I know to be true for myself    You have to decide what's best for you   Suffering blows   this is the hardest part of the journey  I find this to be very similiar to quitting cigarettes  The intensity level to go find relief is there  Just barely got thru today   none of this is easy   Good Luck Kinda like hot snakes and bubble gut  https   www youtube com watch v dYxg6tj2TWM Same as  15ish years   Decided to try and stop by the end of this year  Ok  good to know  thanks for the heads up  I will keep that in mind  Yeah   Let's not drink together another day  Melatonin is a natural chemical that I've used to help me sleep in the past  but a few people have told me they had bad dreams on it  Any sleeping pills please use with extreme caution  I was a pharmacy tech for the last 4 years  and at least 50  of the patients we served were on ambien generic  zolpidem    What most people don't know about that drug is that it doesn't actually make you sleep   it just induces temporary amnesia for 8 hours or so  People sometimes find themselves having done other things things while they thought they were sleeping  like having sex  driving a car  etc    A patient told a nurse friend of mine that he got up in the middle of the night and did some target practice with his gun in the middle of the night after taking it  He didn't realize until he woke up the next morning thinking he'd slept great  and then saw the target full of bullet holes    Not to say that happens with everyone or even most people  but just be careful with those drugs  Most prescription sleep aids are classified as controlled substances and are addictive  more so than marijuana  Zolpidem in particular can hang around longer than 8 hours for women  and there are reports of women driving poorly and getting into accidents the next morning if the drug hasn't worn off    That being said  I am on day 3 of being clean and had awful dreams last night  too  Reading the other comments  it seems like they will pass with time  which is good  Time to start a dream journal again    I'm not drinking with you  I'm sorry      I probably need to revisit some meetings and start seeing my therapist again so I'm strong enough to handle all this   Sounds like a wise plan    Well now I'm in trouble because hairy man has been texting me and said he gets to kiss my lips in less than 24 hours   but I'm pretty sure I also have a date with hot fisherman tomorrow   Gonna have to figure this out fast   Lol The Sword   Fire Lances of the Ancient Hyperzephyrians https   www youtube com watch v iI7227GHvQY  and i know this is kinda cheating  but

cruzin' the Double K later on for the "HOT NOW" sign   You are not alone  I have struggled for years knowing how bad this is for me  I know drinking is the one thing holding me back from better things in life  I've got a few weeks behind me right now and am intending to make the best of this new year  Like you  drinking had lost its luster for me and has long been just a compulsion  Health and more real happiness seem possibly to me if sober  along with not wasting away so many other things  Keep reaching out and keep working on healthy alternatives  One day at a time is not a bad way to get started  yeah man  it's hard enough to do for yourself but to do it for the man  That's an insult  It's worth it though  hang in there  You can't sit with us  I had it pretty bad while I was drinking  It got worse when I stopped but now it is hardly noticible  That being said  I have no idea if it is related     In my area of Alcoholics Anonymous   If you go to an open meeting  no one is required to state if they are an alcoholic  They don't even ask    If you go to a closed meeting  they ask we identify ourselves  but stating "hi my name is        and I choose not to drink today" or "I have a desire not to drink" is perfectly acceptable and even encouraged if you aren't sure you're an alcoholic    AA changed my life  even when I thought I wasn't an alcoholic  AA changed my life from the second I started going  At first I went because I had to  because I was dying inside  Now i go because I want to   Kratom is not harmless and it is not magical  Period   Lol   Love it   Pics on cagonewild   and I was sober posting too   Obviously the weed and Xanax combo has me quite mellow   I guess that's not really sober but you know what I mean  I was on Marijuana Anonymous' page earlier today where they explained how crash dieting can turn a drug test positive even after a month of abstinence  so wether you consiously know it or not you will experience relief through fat burning    I'm sorry to hear about your mom and can imagine the heartache and frustration her drinking has caused over the years    When there is a family history of alcoholism  it puts us at risk  There are red flags in what you shared about your own drinking  Please be very careful about your relationship with alcohol  You may think you are "different"  but alcoholism can sneak up  The fact that when you drink you "drink too much" can be an early sign of alcoholism    I'd strongly encourage you to try out a few Alanon meetings since you've been dealing with an alcoholic mother for so long  They helped me cope better with the alcoholism of loved ones   Thank you  Thank you  I will check it out    Showing up to read post here helps me  its all good my friend  We're all in this together On Wednesdays we wear pink  I can quote the whole movie  '  Moderation is too difficult  I start with the best of intentions and then my resolve dissolves with each sip  Moderation to me is like a crappy dessert  I'd rather have none than have a subpar experience   D11  v2  forgot to post this morning after working out  I did not  and will not drink today     Welcome  My moments of clarity were seldom and short lived  The more I drank  the less they came  I feel very fortunate in that I decided to walk through the door that opened 60 days ago  because it was closed for a long damn time  I  too  was frightened by the prospect of long term abstinence  I truly adopted the day to day approach  and began educating myself on various aspects of alcohol  both have really helped  I came on SD multiple times a day in the beginning  we are all here for you  I will not drink with you today  me too  Well  went for a run again  It was great   Good job  Little victories start to add up  First of all  CONGRATULATIONS   Quitting is not easy but you are on the right path   I smoked weed when I was in High School until I turned 28 years old   I got married and My wife thought it was time to move on   Funny aspect  they just legalized weed in MA   Anyways  the cravings and urges will pass   Do most of your friends still smoke   Marijuana is such a social drug  and staying sober around my friends that lit up was the hardest   I know it sounds cliche  but start working out   Hit the gym or get a new hobby   Find enter peace and challenge your brain with new studies   I started learning French   I am still terrible at it  but it relaxes me   Best of Luck   LCAIII Good for you  I can say as I wrap up Day 40 that day 4 might've been the hardest   Glad to hear it  As tempting as purging can be it's pretty dangerous so I try to think about the risks of heart attack  dental work ect  Power to you in your recovery  All I've done so far is run on the treadmill     Oh  and additionally    I found out my insurance will not cover me for inpatient rehab  Only partial hospitalization  or intensive outpatient  So it technically is still cheaper in Thailand since it is inpatient   I belive in you  Thank you very much  I will post my progress here to keep me motivated   sounds like a not great meeting  But maybe you went because you'll end up helping that guy    Krispy Kreme     I just wanted to say the words aloud i listen to alot of like 70s and 80s punk   number of the beast is a good iron madien song to start with  First of all I guess you're American  So I don't know if you're able to talk to a doctor in terms of simply having someone to come and talk to on a 'regular' basis  once a month or something  without having to pay for it   But that may be able to get you to feel more 'safe' if irritation and anxiety happens  This is also what they are for  I think I read that about 1 3 of doctor appointments are conversation   So they may be able to help you a bit   I stopped about a year ago and had Alot of psychical symptoms which turned into hypochondria which I'm almost over  but I went to the doctor once in a while to simply having a talk  it's free here   It kinda helped but also time helped  since my symptoms are almost out of the way  it is psychological stress symptoms     Edit  content     Is there another grocery store you can use instead    Came in to say this  one of my favorite subs with helpful  specific info   I know it's not the same as getting them fresh there  but KK recommends microwaving un hot glazed for seven seconds   man  Thank you  I can feel myself on edge and I'm trying to be kind and patience but holy hell I needed to vent  Even before anything went wrong today I was anxious    How's day 40    My thoughts  Inpatient rehab is expensive  some people manage to recover in some cheaper way   You might want to try one or more cheaper ways first  and see if they're sufficient   Groups are cheapest   A few appointments a week with an addiction doctor would cost more   An intensive outpatient program  a few nights a week  for a few hours a night  costs even more than that   Day rehab costs yet more   And inpatient rehab  where you sleep there  costs the most   Many insurance plans will pay for addiction doctors  even if you're only going there for counseling  but not for addiction counselors   Not all psychiatrists are so helpful for addictions   A good addiction doctor or addiction counselor might be better   Read reviews before you go   In some places  you can find reviews of addiction doctors  here  https   www ratemds com best doctors  specialty addiction medicine    Or you can try checking for reviews on Google Maps or Yelp or elsewhere   Not all addiction doctors do counseling  but some do   Keep phoning until you find one who does   Addiction doctors are experienced in detecting manipulation   There are  ASAM  http   www asam org   member doctors scattered worldwide   If there are none in your city  contact  ISAM  http   www isamweb org     Disclaimer  I'm not a doctor  and this is not medical advice  Ask your family doctor what s he thinks     Questions  If I may ask   A   Are you  or family  paying the full cash price of rehab  or is your insurance paying   B   Why Thailand   Is it because you're there already   C   What are your thoughts about the idea of trying one or two support group meetings  at least for now before your rehab stay begins   I personally like Narcotics Anonymous  even though I've never used any narcotics   but there are lots of other options  I've been at it for over 25 years   I did take a four year break in my early twenties  but started back up because I was bored and thought there was more to life than just my boring 9to5 routine   Things change as you age and I've watched my peers grow up and become very successful  while me I've just found younger friends to hang out with   I'm on day 3 and the only symptoms I'm having are insomnia and anxiety    I feel great after work  almost euphoric  but as the night grows later i start to worry about falling asleep   Last night I only slept five hours    Thanks man  Means a lot to know I got some support   I used Chantix  and after using it for about 3 weeks  I read Carr's book   There's nothing earth shattering about it  but it's strangely effective   It just articulated what I inherently knew  sometimes ad nauseum  but it worked   I've been smoke free since September of 2015 after almost 35 years of smoking  and I don't miss it one fucking bit  You're welcome  thanks for the feedback   Yeah   I suspect that LGBTQ individuals your age are less likely to have kids than straight individuals  though this is just a hunch   I haven't looked for data  Thanks  Yeah I got the info from him  Was just curious if others had tried it    I can't tell you if you made the right decision  I can tell you that those circumstances would not help me to stop drinking  It sounds like he cares a lot about you and recognizes he can't help you unless he changes his own behavior   I would try to recognize that kindness and use it as motivation to stop drinking   And all those wonderful  deep chats that you had with others are forgotten the next morning  rendering any insights gained  useless  Clean for about 5 yrs  short term memory keys and what not   is back by 6 months  Retention and learning has yet to return  Was very bright as a kid  Dimmed that bulb a bit  sadly   Well  you can't say you didn't give moderation your best shot  Just seeing that list makes me remember how stressful it was trying to moderate  It's actually a relief to have made the right decision  Great post  So happy to not be drinking with you today     Stuff like this is why I believe being an alcoholic is the worst type of recovering addict you can be   Heroine or cocaine might kill you faster  but at least when you decide to quit heroine society isn't shoving it in your face and pressuring you to have another every chance it gets   At least when I go to buy groceries I don't have to walk by the cocaine aisle on the way to the checkout   And I don't say this to minimize the obstacles addicts of other drugs face   Other than a little weed in high school and college  alcohol has been my only vice so I have no idea how bad the cravings of other substances are to an addict   I'm sure the struggle is just as hard     I just really wish society could make a turn and start treating alcohol with the same negative connotations as cigarettes and other drugs   For example  today was the first day back at work after new years and two co workers were discussing their new year's resolution to quit smoking   Everyone was encouraging and saying how great it would be   They were saying they could do it together   When I decided to give up booze it was a constant battle of friends and co workers trying to drag me back to bars and happy hours because I'm a "fun drunk "  I think there's something to be said about the struggle of alcoholism in how drinking is so socially acceptable  actively encouraged  and visible everywhere we go  This made me giggle  Oh the wheeling and dealing we've done in every last possible effort to moderate  Yes to all of this   I started using weed as a crutch to quit drinking several years ago   While pot isn't as physically harmful as alcohol  I've come to realize that I'm not progressing as an individual  just waiting for something good to come along in my life which hasn't materialized in over five years   2017 things are different now and I'm getting ready to move to a new and better horizon    It's unlikely that you experience heavy duty WD's at this point  however  daily dosing is simply something you want to avoid  Perhaps you can view your unfortunate stomach bug as a wake up call  Quit using daily immediately and save yourself a lot of trouble down the road  All the best     You forgot Lent   How many diseases could be cured from the collective brainpower alcoholics put into the elaborate equations of attempts at controlled drinking    Sober today though     I've started tracking mine daily because high BP runs in my family and during a bad anxiety hangover I thought I needed to see a Dr because of it  Turns out laying off the beer for just a couple days put me right back into healthy range   This is a great response to the other thread about moderation  I'm not missing the metal gymnastics the you describe so well   The ancient Greeks use say something like "Where ever you go you take your problems with you " I don't think moving is the answer at all  Suffering is never easy when making deep structural life changes while battling addiction  Im living the suck as we speak  Its moment by moment  I just try to consciously save up my will power to get thru those gauntlets you talk about  I feel you  There are no easy answers  It's not like we got big pharma on ourside to help out  Good Luck bro I cooked a really nice dinner  and could smell even the most basic ingredients as they cooked  It sounds silly  but was actually a really cool sensation   We all share that allergy   We can all tell you it's best to remove it all  but only you can make that choice   We are all just happy you see the road ahead  because most of us can't until much later  Happy birthday  Raising my cup of tea in your honor  we have so much time for activities now  It's pretty unbelievable  thanks for asking  I'm actually starting to get real introspection  Starting to feel like I'm able to get ahead instead of always playing catch up  Feels good   My brother was a meth head and he stayed awake for nearly four days straight and lived to tell about it     I've had other things  like embarrassing myself at a party or social event  but nothing that truly could seriously affect others  This     This was different  This made me take a hard look at myself and say "what the fuck are you doing " I needed that kind of a scare to take it seriously  even though I've been thinking for months that my drinking was a problem   I had the same thing  Consistent sleep was tough  I never thought it'd go away  but after about two months or so it leveled out  Everyone's different  but I'm sure it'll tone down eventually  you wanna share  Liz     we're about to have words  Thanks for sharing   That's awesome  congratulations  I hope to be there soon  I tried Chantix for about 2 1 2 weeks before I just couldn't handle it anymore  I told my boyfriend a joke and he didn't get it  for some reason I was completely crushed and cried for hours like he had just broken up with me lol  Not to mention I was super paranoid about everything and nauseous all the time    it didn't work out but I'm optimistic that there is something out there that will work for me    You poor thing  Sounds like an awful couple of days  You'll find a lot of support here  Now  what's your next step  That's what I'll be doing every night  And lots of reading  Thanks   In the evening  It used to be whenever I came home on weekends from work  so Friday evening  Sat evening  Sun evening   but now I just don't feel that craving anymore  thankfully  Try taking a long hot shower  then eat a late dinner around tenish   This usually helps   Keep your screens turned off and just lay there awake  meditating    what do you mean  "all"  that's great   Get through this  You may be like me and many if not most here where you don't have the ability to stop once started  I can sometimes but too often cannot and am seeing why even start  Sober seems to be ok  on fact a few weeks in and liking it  As far as work goes  maybe bend the truth a little  say you slipped on some ice New Year's Eve  You really don't want to say you don't remember  But do take it seriously  as I know how it goes  Anyway  think about all of this and know it can lead to some bad things  This seems to be a good place to learn more  I was so  so irritable for about a week  I didn't even want to be around me  Ice cream helped immensely   Also  tea  Lots of tea  But I like tea  and it's a treat for me    My mood evened out  now I'm just my normal level of grouchy      Edited to add  and I slept a lot  From what I've read on here  this is not uncommon  I know I wasn't sleeping well when drinking  and I had a lot of healing to do  My body just sucked up all the sleep that I could throw at it for a few weeks   Thank you for this   The first few days were so much easier  now I guess I have to remember to stay strong   I know it's so worth it to be a non smoker    Keep it up man   Yes it's normal for the first couple of weeks  But your body will adjust  You're probably low energy because your body is used to the sugar that's in the alcohol being on a regular influx  Go have some ice cream and let your body recover for a little while  The energy will come back     I had a similar experience with Chantix years ago  I used something called Tabex this time  A friend quit 3 years ago with it and it's worked for me  1 month quit tomorrow  Best part it is way cheaper   40  and all natural  I highly recommend it  Burn it down     Fuck that shit  Talk to a doctor or counselor  Medicines can be very helpful  Yeah  have accepted drinking is the one thing holding me back  A few weeks in and I want to keep going  I want to accomplish things  Thank you  I did not drink today   Yeah its been rough    I guess I don't know what my next step is  Not drink  Go talk to my boss tomorrow about if I should work or not  Renew my tags so that I can go home   Did you drink awesome shooters   So grool Thank you  it's on the box   Oh my goodness  That sounds so scary  Sending you warm thoughts  You are not alone   Just saw this and HOLY FUCKING SHIT  You are amazing   I have my grandkids print the posts out for me   rolls eyes  I'm taking it   It seems to be helping me   My doctor told me to set my quit date for a week after I started taking it   I started bupropion on December 10  and smoked my lady cigarette at 6am on December 17  Did not drink today  but fuck me if Mr  Vodka isn't calling my name  I'm already drunk but I'm stumbling in in the wee hours of the European morning in this thread  I'm not drinking tomorrow  nor the day after that  Maybe I will at some point  For me at this point it's not physical  it's mental and I've made a fair bit of progress towards sobriety today  as weird as that might seem   I've been going through this sub for a wee bit and the cry baby posts and in 24 hours i will read them again  being just as big of a cry baby and feel bad about myself  It's okay though  I'm working on it  Surely there's something positive in me  If we spoke I'd see something positive in you  Thank you   that's nice of you to say This is a sub for quitting weed after long time use  This is the wrong place to ask    You might be good  Buy a take home test at CVS or Rite Aid  Pee on the thing and see what it turns up as  When you pee  pee on the thing mid stream not in the beginning  Drink a lot of water to detox faster   You can ask r trees  They'll say the same thing as me though   I've struggled with alcohol addiction my whole life   When I've needed to stop drinking I've always found a friend in weed  But it's not a friend  only a crutch to help say goodbye to my other friend Alcohol    It was mostly boredom that drove me to become a heavy doser of edibles   Day 3 for me and I'm feeling euphoric  must be the thc leaving my body
