your own stuff and not grant a stranger a free ride  I'm calmer  more even minded  I don't immediately start crying when I wake up in the morning and realize how trashed my life is  I am less angry and am getting in fewer violent confrontations on the street as a result  I actually have a bit of peace of mind for the first time in a long time  I never knew what normal was  So I am just thankful my life doesn't seem to be spinning out of control and that I can assume that I won't  over the course of a day  swing into one of those really nasty black depressive moments when all seems lost and I lose my ability reason and work at a level that is basic to functioning in the workplace  Any thing is better than what was before  Thank you science  You plan to get a job then move  That would be the simplest way  and your parents would probably give you less hassle  Policies may vary  so double check with the mover of your choice   When I shipped my car  I was able to load however much I wanted  so long as the mover could see out the sides and back  your car may have to be shuffled on the hauler as they make pick ups and drop offs en route to you  the driver needs to see to move the car    Car movers is one of those industries that have serious issues with con artists   Do your research before hiring someone   Don't be too cheap  it'll bite you in the ass The comments here  3 as of the time of this writing  are what I expected to read and also what I needed to read   I know I am doing her wrong by staying in this   I am also doing myself a disservice   This is a rebound relationship for her after a failed multiple year marriage   Part of her motivation in pursuing me was to "respond" to her ex husband finding another woman   I have very little relationship experience   I went into this with a "let's try this out" mentality   It was dishonest on my part to stay with her as the hookup stage gradually ended and something else rose in its place   My life plans do not include any permanent romantic partners  kids  or family connections   To the best that I can tell  she is looking for another husband or someone to treat as such   We generally have a good time when we are together   this has been covering up the fact that we are fundamentally incompatible   On the occasions in which we have spoken about it  she has made clear that she is not going to end this   I have to do it sometime soon   for both of us I was under the impression people got their tonsils out due to strep throat infections  Let it happen naturally  If it's real then she won't care how much money you have or what religion you she is The state college sounds like a good idea to me  it probably offers whatever you can imagine studying and will be fun  and since you know someone going there thats nice as well  I would be hesitant of your third option because 1  they dont offer a potential major you might end up with  and 2  If you can have the real college experience  i e cost isnt going to kill you persee  then I say do it  Im guessing the cost of the state school is less than the local private school as well  which would be helpful in that aspect  Do whats right for you tho too  Goodluck You're just giving them a reason not to hire you  Why freely disclose something they cannot ask you about  I'd love to believe we live in a perfect world and they won't discriminate against something they shouldn't in the hiring process but let's be real  We live in the real world and self disclosure of this during the hiring process is the absolute wrong move  Discuss accommodations after you're hired  I have plenty of empathy for people who deserve it  You put the word advice in quotes but that doesn't make it not true  People keep saying it because it is true  Damn you know what's funny  My dad is the same  apart from that he decides to drink himself to sleep most nights and forget about me  Happy New Years btw  just struck 12 for me over here  Anyways  you're dad and his friend seem to be dicks  you do not need to worry about being too nice at this point  if you Dad and his mate were drunk  or theyre just arseholes  don't stand for that bullshit  If you let it slide then it won't stop most likely  It might be hard to speak up at first but trust me it's worth it  If this happened once and nothing similar has happened since then don't worry at all mate I want to die too  I have a bottle of xanex  Ugh there's a little part of me that says things WILL get better and I don't wanna miss it  Try and have a little hope and hold on to it  That's what I try to doMake sure to offer to bring something   if they say nothing  bring wine or champagne   Have funYes  I am penitent of the mistakes I made when I was young   all of them have something to do with women I know a guy who talks so slow and a lot of people thinks he is stupid  He looks like a human version of a sloth  so slow in his movements and that all   One time when he had to present a class in highscool he couldn't handle it and ran away from the class  It was so weird  no one laughed when he left and neither when he came back   He was my friend and i knew him kinda good  he was intelligent  more intelligent than a lot of people  but when i was talking wit him i felt like he never knew what to say  so i guess is so like your situation   He writes great too and explains everything in detail when writing   I don't think you or him are stupid  maybe you are not good at being spontaneous and talking  I'm kinda like that except that i can talk about deeper things with people  but is something that you don't really want to do until you know that person for a long time or because the theme of conversation cames naturally   Practice makes things better  Also getting checked by a profesional helps a lot  Hope things get better for you I always broke up with my girlfriend before valentines day    Once  I got lucky  We had planned to spend the night together at my place and the day before she left my present at my place and said "but don't open it "    I said OK sure  Then I broke up with her  and because the gift was at my place  I kept it  While this doesn't really apply in this situation  getting into someone's personal space can be an effective tool in social situations It's your choice   Everyone make a choice   I was engaged without a engagement ring on   How do you know  Were you there with me  You don't know shit r all people keep asking questions and giving advice are too vague  They also tell us to do things that we are unable to do because we're socially inept  or that we failed attempting to do  If you're going to try to help us  at least be specific  and don't attack the people who need help Thank You very much for your kind offer    Hope you have a great 2017 too  Turned 27 this Christmas Eve  No BF  I try to be positive and continue to improve my life  I want to quit smoking   Little detrimental that I just bought a pack in a guilty depressed haze That's so sad  The thing is   if I wanted to talk to a girl   social anxiety kicks in    if I had the courage to talk ill be worries if she is too religious that she will call the authority for sexual harassment or if she is a gold digger she'll laugh at me for being too nice polite  I'm more to compliment than to say a pick up line or a joke I knew quite a few people that went to school while still technically in a relationship back home  All of them broke up eventually  and most were worse than if they had just done it to begin with after high school  For example guy meets girl at school  guy starts liking girl  current HS girlfriend gets wind and thinks guy is cheating on her  they fight  she makes everything more dramatic than it should be  guy breaks up with HS girlfriend but shes still way too clingly  guy can finally move on and enjoy college  I know of 2 people whoever who dated on and off through college and they met in highschool  they probably broke up a good 5 times but ended up getting married  they are not what i would call a good marrage  More trouble than its worth IMO save yourself now It's possible that you are either bored or tired of same food   Why not try new and different food that you never tried before   Try stopping being picky   Trust me  you will like new foods with your tastiness Congrats  my man  I'm proud of you  Anytime   And thanks for responding  Aww  I'm glad    Your  enthusiasm will hopefully get my butt out running tomorrow morning   PYour brother is going out  Big deal   u alphasfa wanted to comment but couldn't  so here is their PM     Hi there  Muslim here     I ended up on your post while browsing through "new"  This one caught my eye and I clicked on it  Decided to check it out  I wouldn't be surprised you don't like Islam  After all  you've only seen the radical side of it     Now you've only mentioned two points in your post so I'm just gonna peacefully explain them as well as I can     First of all  you mentioned the part that says kill all non believers  That part is true  Yes  it is  BUT what people fail to see is context  This was said during a war  Not before the war  not after the war  During the war  Which means "specifically kill THIS army"  That army is long dead now  And afterwards  Quran ordered Muslims to no longer disturb any non Muslims  "To them their religion and to you  yours"  Now if certain extremist groups  atheists and Muslims both  take all this in the wrong context  that's not Islam's fault     That being said  we discuss the issue of Muhammad  S A W W  and his wife  They lived in a desert 1400  years ago in the scorching heat and lack of food  They were completely different people  physically  For example  if you compare someone living in the mountains  they'll have stronger lungs and legs than someone who lived in a seaside city all their life     Just like that  girls at that time hit puberty very  very fast  Lifespans weren't very long  average age was 60   People matured and died earlier  Aisha  R A  married Muhammad  S A W W  but lived with her parents until she was ready to go live with her husband  She stayed his wife until he passed away  She was a best friend to him and he was to her     Since I am Muslim  now what's my duty  Shall I kill every non believer I see and marry a man asap  Not at all  I have many Christian friends and a boyfriend at the age of 19  I'll marry whenever I am ready  The average life expectancy is 70 80 years now  I have a long time to decide what I wanna do with my life     Islam isn't a bad religion  It's basic concept is love  belief and brotherhood  But if you take it out of context  or if you judge every Muslim in the world based on jerks like ISIS  that's not very fair  Please feel free to ask me anything you want  I'm willing to explain  and the reply for anyone interested     I judge no one on anything besides their behaviour  I just really don't like Islam  Thank you for the response  and the clarification on the context     Think of it this way  How many times have you heard of a radical Islamist performing an act of terrorism  It's in the news practically everyday  Now think of how many times you heard of an act of terrorism in the name of Christianity or Buddhism  I personally can't recall any  It's clear which is more peaceful  and I don't believe in them either  Even if the basis of the religion were to be considered good  then Islam wouldn't be outright 'good'  That's for the reason that just like any other religion  Islam has far transcended the simple concept of belief in something  and is now a  growing  community  The community is led by the same motives  but is understood differently by several factions     This would mean that the theoretical removal of the source would eradicate both the good and the bad  which some people are torn between  I mean sure  we can remove the bad  but what about all the innocent people     There are so many misunderstandings of your book that it causes me certain doubts as to whether it was written by someone who truly believed in the causes you mentioned  I don't think my opinion will change regardless of how good an argument someone pits  but I still believe that Muslims do not believe in peace fully  even if they say and think they do     I also would just like to say again that I hold no negative opinion on Muslims besides those who follow the Qu'ran in a way harming other people  just like I'd hate anybody who follows some of the rules within Leviticus     Edit     Sorry for the text wall  Might edit     Edit 2     EditedFrom  Wikipedia  https   en wikipedia org wiki Auditory processing disorder       is an umbrella term for a variety of disorders that affect the way the brain processes auditory information  1  Individuals with APD usually have normal structure and function of the outer  middle and inner ear  peripheral hearing   However  they cannot process the information they hear in the same way as others do  which leads to difficulties in recognizing and interpreting sounds  especially the sounds composing speech     nbsp   I am not a doctor  so take my attempted explanation ELI5 with a grain of salt  From what I understand  people with APD hear you just fine  their ears work well  but their brain may have some trouble interpreting what they heard  especially speech    You know how some people can't understand you  at all  when you talk to them in clubs or loud environments  They may have some degree of APD  they are actually hearing what you're saying  but their brain has trouble differentiating your words from the background noise    I suppose it's like needing glasses  You know it's a tree  you see the little leaves  even if they're blurry blobs   But you may not be able to figure out what kind of tree it is exactly because it's all blurry    My uneducated mind thinks APD is more of a spectrum  I've used that particular example because you'll find a ton of people that can't understand speech very well in loud environments even when the words are clear  myself included  I have also a hard time with phone videoconference conversations unless they're high quality  not that unusual either  Almost everyone else is already taken by that age and grills look for guys with relationship experience  who are ready to have a child with and spend the rest of their lives with  not inexperienced losers like us  Some   American girls are spoiled  The percentage of girls that fit the behavior you're describing is very small  but unfortunately they dominate our perception because they make the most noise   You could just as easily say the same thing about guys  having ridiculous standards  having tons of sex  etc  These types of guys exists  and are just as common as girls like how you describe  they are known as "Chads"  But they are in the small minority just like the girls  There are a ton of girls who aren't spoiled  who are virgins  and don't spend a ton of time out and about having fun  Just like us   Unfortunately  we interact with this kind of person less than the kind you describe  which leads to the imbalance in our perception  we see a lot more of the spoiled type with ridiculous standards than the down to Earth type Join anything  local clubs  work  sports  college  ect  If your 21 theres no reason you cant go out and enjoy new years at any bar anyways  and your bound to meet people there even if it is only for the night  friends dont have to make the night for it to be a good one I lasted maybe 3 or 4 months  I didn't feel any different  granted I was just trying it to see if anything happened  Honestly  I think masturbation is normal and healthy in moderation  Take an engagement vacation instead  From my understanding they do  That's how they catch people who steel phones and go through another carrier  I recommend you Ender's Game  the novel  It's about this ruthless about oneself  the conflict between being violent and wanting to be kind at the same time   I think the solution is to accept our own imperfection  and become more "gray" evaluating morals  It's not always your fault and you have no obligation to be good with all the people all the time  so it's ok to break a glass  kick a trashcan or punch someone in the face if he is harassing you Don't bother to think about your friends   Focus on your life   You have to find new friends   New Year's Eve may be important but it's "Getting drunk  dudeeeee" holiday    If you really want to do something  call your different friends then   Tonight  I am going to my friend's house for redbox movie and wine cheese   Nothing news  really OK  maybe 2016 wasn't quite as shitty as everyone's been saying   Congrats Hope it doesn't happen again mate  Shit happens ya'know  Hope you're doing well if I ever see you again i desperatly need them  but they won't be there for me This meme is unfuriatingBasically its just the extremeists saying to kill non believers i dont believe killing a non believer is the correct thing to do and majority of the muslims believe this too Also i wouldnt go near anyone below the age of 18 majority of the time child marriages happen mostly in third world countries is because of culture not religion although i did hear once someones finishedwith puberty theyre considered an adult but again majority of people wouldnt touch a child in that way its the same with most muslims just a few that do and i find them disgusting I don't understand how you can make those assumptions  Are you saying that people that are very religious make false sexual assault allegations    Not all women are bad or have evil intentions  Just like not all men are bad  Trust your instincts whether they are a good decent person or not I'm a "normie" and I don't get any pleasure out of bringing people down  Those people bullying you are probably losers themselves trying to make themselves feel better  Don't let internet trolls bring you down  they don't know you  Take everything they say with a grain of salt Well  if it wasn't for your friends idea then you wouldnt have anything create in the first place  He DESERVES at least half  Yeah that's the right thing to do  he's just such a fragile person though   Guess I'm too soft of a guy  but it has to be done Congrats yo  I didn't kiss anyone until I was 20  so I know the feeling     Now  to the more important part  I hope you used a condom  you're too young for kids   99  of elephant seal bulls wander the seas as lonely bachelors their entire lives   If this world was designed  it was designed by a sadist Don't have a father figure   mom and dad got divorced when my mom was pregnant    saw my dad in vacations only and cuz of my shitty mom I doubt EVERY thing I do wether if should I do it or noAlright I responded a bit agitated and I apologize for that Oh no it's fine I don't mind questions   When I have an episode like the one I described it does impact me as I do get rather violently ill  I often joke that I would force it upon myself during my high school years to get out of class  But yes  it's quite constantly there  especially in the last few days hence I had to bring it somewhere   I don't imagine myself dying though  it's more the 'after I'm dead' that is the main body  And it's only myself  I mean of course I worry about others but that's nothing different from the average person Thank you   Good luck   I forgot to mention  both married and have other kids as well   I now have a big unique family   As long as you guys can stay civil and both keep the child first  It will be okay      Also  I loved having young parents   I always felt like they understood me better than my friends parents understood them     Almost like a Gilmore Girls esque thing   Lol  But more my dad and me  female  I hate to rain on your parade  but adoption is a real crapshoot  I've know a few who had a great time with their adoption  they are adults now  but I know a literal sea of ppl  including my wife  who had a pretty shitty time with adoption  If the adoption is within one's family  like an uncle or aunt adopting   it might be good  But random strangers  Even if they are OK ppl  its still very difficult for the child in the BEST of circumstances  ie  stable  good parents    So it is an option of course  but it is NOT without issues  And lets not even talk about shitty adoption agencies  Keep it in the family if at all possible  unless one's family is even worse  Oh I can see how that would be aggravating    I wouldn't want to tell you to change or give vague advice that amounts to 'be different'  And I certainly wouldn't want to attack you   One thing I might offer is self compassion  I see a lot of hurting people in here who are likely harder on themselves than others are on them   Nobody deserves to be spoken to the way many people here seems to speak about themselves     Don't believe everything you think   A thought isn't a truth  it's a suggestion that you can chose to give validity or not   Mindfulness meditation and cognitive behavioural therapy were very helpful in teaching me to accept myself and my thoughts   If you are depressed anxious and frequently find yourself thinking negative things about yourself  I'd highly suggest you look into it    could change your life like it did mine So  did you tell her that she was your first   Also  how did it go  Did you know what you were doing  Did you finish really fast   My first time I had no idea what I wad doing but my girlfriend at the time knew that  and was a very good teacher   Congrats  hope it works out for you man  I have a nice boyfriend  You're not one of us Please trust me that when your sugars get under control the fatigue will disappear   Type one is a difficult  lifelong struggle but there are enormous resources out there for you  Please pm me if you want Ahh  miss communication I see  Happens to all of us  Looks are one hundred percent a factor because the basic urges that compel us to mate are based on physical applications  Saying that looks don't matter is just attractive people telling us that we are ugly politely Show meBelieve me  you would be a FA even if you were in a developing country  The grass isn't greener on the other side  You would get some flings because you would be "exotic"  nothing else    Source  Non American redditor Ball out  Enjoy the experience  You don't have to pretend to have fun with the girl if you aren't feeling her  Just treat her as a friend you're spending New Years with  Lessen the pressure  Happy NYE Talk to your friend and determine shares of the proceeds from the percentage of work you each do  Maybe the friend gets an automatic ten percent for the idea  but has to help make it happen to get more  Whatever you decide  write that shit down Sounds like the first thing you need to do is get some distance between you and your family  Get some independence and discover who you really are  I have no idea about your financial position so I understand this might be very hard for you    There's a saying "you cannot love anyone until you love yourself" And this isn't mean in an arrogant way   You need to be able to trust your own decisions and not worry if things don't pan out because that how life works  You win some you lose some  You're still young but life is too short  Figure out what exactly you aren't happy with in your life and  change  itSo     what are  you  doing to improve this situation which is so intolerable to you  Applying for jobs so you can be independent  Registering for online classes if you can't handle attending college in person  Talking to your guardian s about what you need from them that you feel they aren't providing  No one is going to be able to help you unless you can articulate what concrete things you want  You don't even seem to be able to articulate what's  wrong   much less what help you need  how do you expect your father to be able to do anything useful  I'm sure there will be a new dept head for the Congressional Budget Office after Jan 20 and they will say the opposite Nurse  Your question is completely irrelevant and besides  We know because we do not lack self awareness  I have been told I am not a good looking person and that I seem to have an "attitude problem"   Whatever that means   So there  Your question has been answered Thank you  I'll try  I have to Personally I've known people who spent several thousand on an engagement ring  and always thought that was insane  My wife and I both saw eye to eye on this  which was nice  From our perspective the money is better spent on a future home  I ended up spending about  500 on a custom ring and we were both very happy with the result   Some good advice I've received regarding marriage in general is "happy wife  happy life"   Is your objection to the ring purely on financial practical grounds  What is the root of her desire for one  I suspect there is a comfortable middle ground that will make you both happy Fuck   were you mostly playing videogames like me My grandfather had a stroke and nobody told us  I had to find out through someone else   on OkCupid  Let's not use an online dating site that the overwhelming majority of people don't use to determine what goes on in real life Hugs to you    No it actually isn't  Doing nothing and being excluded on a day where most people  even people who don't generally party usually find something to do  is a reminder how we really don't have friends My best friend rear ended a guy by texting while driving  I always tell her not to  She never thinks anything will happen  It took everything I had to not scream "I told you so" at her  Edit  grammar errorI thought it would be uplifting because the whole thread is full of stories   There's a guy who has a decent amount of upvotes describing how he is going to meet up with his family and his dog to celebrate  so I don't see how exactly my post would be seen as assholish   I don't know what this sub is  true  But if people are triggered by the mere statement that   I'm going to a restaurant to celebrate   than this sub is truly way lonelier than I though  Truly saddening That verse is specific to one particular battle  the Battle of Badr  It is a battle in which a large Meccan army traveled to make war on the muslims  It is not a catch all verse designed to say kill all non believers  Even if you read a bit after that verse you will find some more information that refutes your understand    Verse 8 19   If you  disbelievers  seek the victory   the defeat has come to you  And if you desist  from hostilities   it is best for you  but if you return  to war   We will return  and never will you be availed by your  large  company at all  even if it should increase  and  that is  because Allah is with the believers   Even near the end of the Chapter  verse 61  lays it pretty bare   And if they incline to peace  then incline to it  also  and rely upon Allah   Indeed  it is He who is the Hearing  the Knowing For me  I had to force myself to go out more    I spent two months where everyday I hung out with someone even though I was working 3 jobs at the time   I tried to not make it the same person all the time   I would reach out to old friends   A lot of it was me having to go meet them   And every time I went out with friends  I made it a goal to make one new friend  Just to get my extrovert back    I also made myself exercise    And I HATE exercising  I didn't do much  about 30 mins   This may sound weird  but I would put in my calender a future alerts privately  around a month out  with something motivational from things like  get you shit together or who did you meet today  reminder  what can you do today to further your career   I did them so randomly that sometimes they would even take me by surprise   I did one like a year out once saying by this time you better have a better job and be living on your own  and strangely enough  I had    It made me feel really good    My inner voice is mean  so my reminders were usually mean like my inner voice left them   Lol    The idea of a woman wanting to be intimate with me seems very foreign to me too  despite it being something I crave  In most third world countries marriages are set up between families in order to ensure a better social foothold  So even then you would be overlooked  Also I fail to see the allure of having to relocate simply to date someone  If anything that just solidifies your failures No  I have  10k I could easily spend  it's just the practicalityblog addressing behavior that I intend to alter and or extinguish in the following year   maybe something for others to consider or not   This is the theory I accept the most  I must have done something horrible in my past life in order to be punished in this way She was 100  on board for that and what we originally decided onThere are all kinds of traditions that people don't care for and don't follow   Unfortunately  it's concerning that your GF only "reluctantly agreed" to your opinion with regard to this tradition   That tells me that you and she are not on the same page about this and that she places value in having an engagement ring even if you don't      If she really does want one  I think you ought to gladly get her a ring out of your love for her  no arguments  no guilt inducing statements  etc         A minimum of 12 bus journeys a day  That  um  that seems like a  lot   Where do you live  how far are you from the school  How much  time  does this take  Where I grew up the school district provided a bus for all students who lived far enough away that they couldn't reasonably be expected to walk   have you talked to the administrators at your kids' school  Do you have neighbors or friends or family who could be talked into driving your kids to school  or failing that  bribed  I'm not sure if your supermarket is the same  but when I was working at one  managers are around the grocery workers more and have to talk to them more  telling them what to do   so it might just be exposure  The deli department doesn't seem to be visited by managers that much Ive actually done both myself  i had a job while i was at university and it was nice in the bank account and time aspect back then but i only got it because I hated my school and most of the people i knew there wernt people i genuinely enjoyed being around  fast forward a year transfered out into a new school and things were great  i didnt get a job because I didnt want one at the time and if i had decided to it wouldve been on campus very part time  problem was I got a little  actually very  too far into the drug scene and ended up failing out so take that for what its worth  IMO college is all about meeting people and having a good time and if your spending all that money to go to a school 200 miles away  you might as well enjoy it on its own without the job  Maybe plan on leaving the job and try and join a bunch of things that interest you on campus  or change your living arrangements at school if that might help  Hope it works out for you yeah  it's just hart to accept that they don't care   and that I'm aloneI would hate for that to happen    I'll keep it in mind  Thank you  Fact of the matter is  being good looking allows guys to open the door to contact with women  that door doesn't even exist most of the time for people without stellar looks   If it makes you feel any better  the same is true for 90  of men   As a man  you have to be extremely good looking before you consistently get positive reactions from girls based on your looks     Thank you   Ill try my bestI hear you   10k is a lot  What is she looking for in the ring I honestly do not think of it as "embarrassing" one bit   If anything  you're saving yourself from a cycle of embarrassment if you start to lose not only your sanity  but also your friends whether that's through borrowing money  lying  desperation gambling   I'm so glad you've recognized your limits and have made a conscious step in curbing that compulsive feeling to gamble   I wish you the best in your 2017 and hope you persevere and grow on this experience  I'm sure you'll come out a much stronger person Video games  food  YouTube  memes  Also warm weather keeps me going You as well It's infuriating isn't it  So so dangerous  Way to go  guy  It's so awesome that you've found your match    Most men are settled for by women who believe can't get Chad anymore once she hits 30 oh she's not  it's the community that's now in revoltWhat do you think vitamins and supplements are for I'm a cisgender woman  But damn  that's sort of a rude question  no  I wouldn't say picky  Particular is a better word  I'm someone who doesn't fall for every girl he sees  and  at twenty seven  have only been interested in maybe five or six girls  A problem that people don't seem to grasp is that all humans are creatures of habit  We get up and go to the same job and meet the same people  go home and go to bed  day after dreary day  The chances of us actually meeting someone new is severely against us  and the chance that  if you do  that person having any interest in you is also against you  That's just the cruelty of reality for us  We are all victims of circumstances   is he okay  I don't know if your family is close but yeah  someone should have informed you at least  Hoping he is Yes you have to  Just remember you are not alone  Things can get better  Peace and love Please don't try this at home  http   i imgur com IyW6ujw jpg Gotcha  I was asking because you said she'd agreed 'reluctantly'   Forget that noise from others  The only thing that really matters is what you both want  As long as you're on the same page you will be fine  Good luck ring shopping Good for you I will be enjoying it at home again with the company of my dog Ya don't feel good about it guess we'll just send it back to wind   I'm someone who's dealt with a very modest appetite most of my life  Too many carbs will sustain you  but they will leave you drowzy and unmotivated  I suggest eating meats  Something high in protein like chicken or turkey would probably be best  The nutritionalist is right though  You need to get fruits in your diet to balance out what you've already been taking in  The acids in fruit should help breakdown what's already in your stomach and should regulate your stomach acid  An apple or two a day could definitely help  I wish you the best of luck No  you did the right thing  They were doing something extremely dangerous  extremely stupid and you probably saved one of them from losing a limb  How shitty do you think NYE would be   then    It sounds like your husband is trying to guilt trip you out of malicious childishness yeah  good point  I'm kind of hard on want v need  yeah  good point  I'm kind of hard on want v need  No offense meant by this  but I don't think you could've made that sound any more scary   haha thanks Life would be easier with a penis  I would never have to worry about pregnancy    Alas   vagina  Don't smoke weed while you're sick  It'll just make you feel worse  Talking from experience I am by no means a mental health professional  but many of the symptoms you describe sound like those associated with schizophrenia  I would absolutely discuss this with a psychiatrist    27 year old virgin who is definitely fat  I know people on here don't like to hear this sometimes  but you can do something about this I up voted but I'm not alone   I've got a master hunter with me  Oh and he is German  That's a lie  it is jagermeister  tear emoji Any statistical sources for this  And this comment doesn't refute my claim that the statistic you did give is flawed If you do  just a hit or two at a time  The smoke won't be good for it  but the buzz might carry you over the annoyance of sickness for a while  Speaking from experience See I would totally be into hanging at someone's house with their dog I grew up catholic and i can definitely relate  went to all the catholic schools and all  and i am not one for organized religion  I consider myself agnostic  The Church is fucked up  and the fact that anyone can acknowledge it as anything other than brainwashing is just beyond me  My father will go as far as to make fun of people who question ANYTHING written in the bible  if you dont agree with the church's interpretation of it  then your wrong in his eyes and he wont even listen to the other side on that topic  Needless to say living with them was and is  unfortunately had to move back home  a chore  If your 17 college must be a possibility  especially for a conservative family  So id say wait it out until you can get out and just go to a university that isnt conservative and christian  you probably just need a change or something  If you want to befriend more people  go for it  You'll find the right crowd soon enough  Don't worry about people judging you  Most people don't judge others very much  and if they do  they're shitty people who you don't want as friends   Stop calling yourself an introvert  It will only hold you back  I  too  am introverted  but I put myself out there anyways  and it's very rewarding   This natural awkwardness you speak of wears off with more and more interactions  It also is magnified in our own heads   Your friend   An ex lonesome teenage boyTake it from a veteran from the dating scene  You are better off to get out of the rat race   I am FA for decades and loving it   Do whatever you want  any time you want No drama   More money than you can spend     Retire early    I'm basically in the same boat  I'll be 28 this year  It sucks because I'm the oldest of my siblings  and whenever my parents bring up grandkids at family outings everyone looks at me  I'm the furthest away from kids out of the 3 of us  Where in the states  Like Canada  the US is massive keep in mind that 3 countries make up most of NA  and the weather is incredibly variant depending on location  To say that the weather in the states is pretty good would be like saying that the weather in Europe is pretty good No  do not do this It's basic alpha fux beta bux   Not everything needs scientific sources because it doesn't fit your world viewI look at it this way   Tonight is 'amateur drunk driving night'  Too many people getting drunk and all  Even if you took a cab everywhere   and did the responsible thing  some jackass that thought he could drive home crashes into the cab you're in       I know this cause I was that jackass once  Ahhh I see  absolutely    I didn't think of it that way but yeah makes sense  Thank you   Yeah  and she's totally gonna get in bed already wet at the thought of my massive culture and personality    PLEAASEEEEEAfter a couple of conversations I attempted to carry out through text  I have

There should be no back up  Cleaning the tub after every use is a better way to keep it clean than cleaning once a month  But you should tell the apartment manager that your tub is backing up and that you tried cleaning out the drain yourself and it hasn't fixed the problem Good job bud   continue the good work and stay positive  That's a lot accomplished Wow  great job  Very brave of you OP  Good luck tomorrow    Ah ok so we're using idiotic  internet  PUA lingo that no one in the real world either uses nor knows about to make claims now  Gotcha It's draining just fine  Maybe I didn't do a thorough enough job though    Yeah I guess it's not so much about erasing the negative symptoms entirely  but I think of it as learning new healthy coping mechanisms and ways to live with them  To think and then act differently  not succumbing and getting defeated by them  Some medications also just seem to just stop a flood of negative emotions that would otherwise spiral out of control  Like  on some meds  I feel like crying but am  physically unable to  shed a tear somehowCool story   I am  Got off the meds that made me balloon up  Changing my diet  Already dropped two pant sizes

have sagging loose skin from weight loss and I don't want to look like the Pale Man from Pan's Labyrinth  I honestly don't know  When I was 21 I said I'd kill myself at 23 if I still never kissed anyone  and 25 if I was still a virgin  Here I am at 27 still kicking  I just keep going on somehow  It'll be pretty cold I'm in wisconsin which is roughly as north  but I'm not sure how the altitude and westward position will affect the temps  Hard to say really  but the west coast is generally considered to be a good place to be by a large portion of the population  If you're liberal or even moderate  for your politics you'll likely fit in pretty well too  I'm considering schools in that area and the natural landscapes and progressive worldview are big things that draw me to the area Patent it  then he can go suck a horse cock Thank you for your response  Any advice on how to talk to them in the morning  I feel like my husband's friends might think I am a terribly boring and inconsiderate person    I would like to apologise for the way I reacted  but I don't feel like I need to apologise for my action of stopping an uninformed use of fireworksI see what you're saying and logically it makes sense but some part of me wants the satisfaction of knowing I'm competent enough of a human being to maintain a SO type relationship for a long period of time  I'm kind of doubtful that's the case though    However  if I want to take a bath instead of a shower  the tub fills with scummy water   So this means when you fill the tub  the water is scummy right out of the tap  Is the water in your sink scummy  The toilet   Fill a water glass with water from the tub's spout and look at it  If it's scummy  you've got a problem with your water pipe to the tub  That's not right  Talk to the landlord Last night I finished work at 11  came home and treated myself by having a bath  as opposed to my usual shower  and went to bed  Today my family went to the beach and I couldn't go

that great  neither are you or anyone else  As a single creature we are absolutely worthless  But as a society we are worse than worthless  We are  self  destructive  Am I broken for not jumping into

begin  escalate  and end  Apply this knowledge to new conversations Lol wtf are you even talking about  So many assumptions and it's hilarious  Thanks for the free entertainment I'm not really big on politics in general  Although I'm into a clean city and lots to do and outdoorsy things  Considering that  A  You didn't own the property  B  They didn't know how to operate fireworks  and C  There wasn't any safety equipment laying around  you did the right thing  Like  if the fireworks detonated and the apartment building  not your room but the building itself  caught on fire  well that won't sit too kindly considering all the terror scares going on  Also  how would you guys pay for any property damage and medical charges    " My husband told me I need to take more risks and that     I should had let his friends hurt themselves     if they wished to do that  That it is     not my place to micromanage them     "  That's bullshit  You  being the reasonable and caring human being you are  were looking out for your husband and his friends  That's really shitty and childish for him to say though No  Not at all  I don't understand it either   Some of us are just Ferdinand the bull   trying to be good people getting drug in the ring with a matador against our will   I don't get it    Nothing is wrong with you  though  I think there is something wrong with everyone else you weren't drunk enough Feel free to ignore this  because I don't got no advice  Because usually  in this case  I'm the clingy one who has no friends  However  I've had a few people who were clingy to me years back  and inwas brutally honest with them  I highly suggest you're not though  since I felt like a huge piece of shit  As time passed they understood  keep in mind then guy had problems too The KKK is

 Most of the time you are selling your body and your mind  It is a basic need and there's no real reason for anybody to go without other than stigma    OP  keep doing what your doing as long as it pleases you  you've done nothing to be ashamed of  I'd say the only reason not to is if it's negatively affecting your life and or finances  Friend  I'm so sorry that you're dealing with all of this  I'm sorry that you can't find mental health care professionals who understand your needs  I'm sorry that you're so  understandably  terrified of your parents taking control  And  of course  I'm sorry for your past and current suffering   Are you currently in school  For someone as intelligent as you  I think that higher education could be a great help to you  to put you  in a better situation  I don't know if you can work  but if you can  then education can open doors that will allow you to live more comfortably  even if it won't get rid of your everyday struggles I entered several of the monthly contests on  r proceduralgeneration and even won one of them   In other news  my hobbies are still dorky as all hell If you've cleaned your tub and the water is gross  then the problem is the water coming from the tap  Talk to the landlord  this is a maintenance issue Notes  gifts  etc  If you want to do it in person  do your best  It won't be perfect  but it won't be bad either  Practice make oerfct Well at least I'm not alone in that aspect  Although it's hard to believe there's enough people that care to actually change anything  I can't even seem to find one in daily life anymore Yup  If you care  read the sidebar or the  stickied thread  https   www reddit com r ForeverAlone comments 4s20df a thread for new visitors about the sub and its    otherwise just move on   Id be alone  but I got beer  Im drunk bitches As a teenager I would only take selfies when I was feeling super insecure and could post them somewhere I knew I'd get compliments  It never actually worked for improving how I felt  Eventually I grew out of it  Now I don't take any pictures of myself at all  except when my boyfriend wants some nudes Lol I've been FA my entire life you dumbass  Again  thanks for entertaining me with your idiotic assumptions about me Eh  the majority of girls I've met seem to prefer a slimmer build as opposed to a ripped  Hercules esque look I think it's more like a girl will like you for your looks  stay with you for your personality I feel the same wayHey congrats  The same thing happened to me  but I was 19 at the time  Guess what  12 years later I'm married to the girl  That almost makes me want to go out even more Well maybe if you were Chad you wouldn't be FA and I wouldn't be incel if I was Chad   ALL WOMEN WANT CHAD For fun   https   youtu be lQlIhraqL7o

drink  then don't   But if you honestly want to try it  just have a beer  I really have been considering buying a house but am having trouble deciding on what kind   Do I buy a small house assuming I will be FA forever   Or a larger one in the 1  chance I have a family in the future     Is it worth buying one as a single person    My rent is insane  about  1700  so I feel I would be far better off putting the money towards a property I own I would take pictures or video of the hose  get concrete evidence  not proof  evidence that they were stealing your water  Then confront them and demand they pay you back for the overage of the water bill  If they decline you sue the shit out of them in small claims court    Talk with your water company and find out how much your bill would normally be without the overages  and total it up and Sue for that amount  If you have concrete evidence  you should have a pretty strong case Keep talking  You're just making yourself look more and more like a fool  Or maybe you're just a troll  I'm leaning towards the second one   Edit  oh  I see you're a poster on  r incels  Well  that clears things up You need counseling nowMY fear is once I 'accept' being FA and resign myself to it  the rest of me will go     At that point  what's the point in staying in shape   Or getting a shitload of money and having a good career    What's the point of life in general  to retire old and die old and alone   I feel like at least not giving up gives me some kind of a purpose If they want to fuck themselves up  let them  If they don't whilst doing so  then it will happen eventually and so they will learn another life lesson  On the other hand  grade 3 fireworks in Prague heh  Can't say I wouldn't be up there with them too  Nothing to feel shitty about none the less  people being people  Be glad you're there for them lol Nice  That's what I was thinking  Thanks You're better off putting this in a r4r or local sub   Much more people Turning 28 in

expecting pitchforks around here  I'm so glad you posted  wow  This must really ease his mind  Have a great 2017 and I bet you have some  really  interesting stories Yeah you don't HAVE to drink in order to have a social life  You can still go to bars and hang out but no one's forcing you to drink  and if they are they're just douchebags and you probably shouldn't befriend them anyway  Giants made the playoffs is a positive  Even year bullshit ended is what made it a positive for me     29 is a shitty ACT score that means nothingThank you for the kind words  I need thisAs opposed to old and FA and in a dingy one room apartment     At least the divorced guy had a family at one point   Well  businesses aren't just developers  What can happen offer to make it happen  Is he a good

 if he's up there he gave us this life Nope  but I'm depressed and my brain is backwards  Even my shrink said it's normal for alcohol to make depression worse  It makes me more anxious than usual  and that's it u the aero naut how has it been going in regards to this situation  May I have an update So there's abortion  there's adoption and there is also total and logical acceptance  You made a mistake  we all do  Accept it  forgive yourself  which you are both currently doing  and just work hard  Yes it'll be tough to manage a kid  school  growing up and working but eh  That's life  deal with it  Be happy  you may have a son daughter  Nothing is impossible is life provided you work hard and you realise the end goals  End goals being having a life and taking care of one  Granted you may not have all the experience but a person will never ever have all the experience they need   You have parents to help  girlfriend to help  her parents to help too  Don't think it's a burden to put responsibility to them  it's not  We are humans  we all take and give  We all can help with each others issues  Just don't be lazy  don't give up and don't forget  Sadly I live 45 minutes from Montreal near Granby   In my experience unemployment only pays out if you are laid off  and not if you voluntarily quit OMG  this sounds right down my fking street  Bit too late though  took my anger out on my PS4 controller last week    oops Can't really blame 'em when most girls have hordes of men to choose from  It's no different than companies choosing the best candidates when they have many job applicants thanks  Well  he never said he did it all by himself  23 yr 40hrs a week OP sounds like the kind of young person whose self awareness you should be championing  not trying to find flaws in  You can't knock a guy for taking advantage of his situation and working hard    Not that I'm aware of  I  too  have spent time with escorts  I feel no shame whatsoever  I get what I want  and the escort gets what they want  No drama  Ultimately  it's cheaper than having an SO who nags and spends all of your money Get a back brace  Go to a doctor and get a doctor's note for modified work load Express true interest in learning more about them  Ask questions  strive to know them    But if it's not genuine  they will see through it and you will seem superficial Yeah  Unemployment don't work if you quit  Or everyone would quit and apply for it and  shit Well you sure kept that conveniently vague  "A serious illness"  I suppose if you leave it that open ended  anything you say will be true  Not sure the point of saying it though     Infection  genetics  and lifestyle are the most influential causes of disease     Pretty much every doctor I know thinks anyone who gets sick either has an infection  or it "just happened to them"  AKA  genetics   For people in this profession to completely omit the entire lifestyle factor like they tend to do  is insanity  I've owned houses twice  The first one didn't end up financially worth it due to a market crash  I had to move for work and I was underwater so I made it a rental  but as it was a small house in a family oriented town keeping it rented at a useful price was difficult  so as soon as I could sell it for more than I owed  I did  at about 5  below what I originally paid    My current house is small  2br  but in an area known for vacation rentals  so worst case if I have to move to a city for work  or find a partner and need to move somewhere larger I'm pretty sure I can keep it rented and paying for itself even if I can't sell    So  the variables are too numerous to count  but I find it worth it  If it looks like the real estate and job market where you are will let you stay for at least 5 years then it's probably worth it  Go for it say it was inspired That is me this year   Cheers Life might get kind of unhappy for her if she always has to justify a want to you    Now would be a good time to loosen up on this rigidity      Whelp  This is how social norms are enforced  If you want to opt out  just stand your ground  If you want to do a shut up ring to keep them quiet  buy a mossanite ring  Utterly brilliant  but less than a thousand all said  All they want is to see something sparkly   Good Luck   Hope it's everything you want it to be   In some interviewing classes I took I learned that almost all questions asked in these kinds of interviews can be answered with just a handful of examples  Try to think of examples of different things you've handled that might apply to situations that the job will entail   For example  I work in retail  so I try to have a situation for customer service  one for leadership  one for problem solving  etc  You can rehearse those answers before the interview to make yourself more comfortable Nice    I've always been fat  Which is weird  because I'm the only fat person in my family   mom  dad  and brother are all incredibly thin  I somehow got fucked over    But getting on meds for my severe depressive episodes ballooned me up to 340 pounds  Sounds crazy  but it happened  mileage varies with meds  but Prozac really fucked me up    Went off of those  and in July I got on something which was not notorious for weight gain  big thanks to my doc for helping out with that specific issue     When I got my blood tests back  I saw that my triglycerides were high and I was a couple of points away from pre diabetes  so I've been cutting down on sugar and cutting down portions  I have been dropping weight since July  I'll probably be getting a blood test again soon  as I keep exhibiting even more symptoms of PCOS  but hopefully my numbers have improved    I wish that the weight loss was quicker  but without the loose skin  I feel like I know where you're coming from  When I was younger I learned to associate alcohol and drugs with  for lack of a better word  assholes  My parents always set a good example  but seeing the behavior of my peers who drank and did other things left a bad taste in my mouth to the extent that I decided I'd never drink until the legal age  21  and never do drugs   Fast forward a few years to college when I'd met new people  had new experiences  and I did decide to have a few beers despite being just 19  For me it felt right  mostly because the people I was with then were better people  I didn't see this as a betrayal of my "younger self"  just a change in circumstance  It sounds like your situation may be similar   Anyway  your mileage may vary  but I would say to give it a try and have fun  It's your life and you are allowed to change your mind    at the end of the day you are only really accountable to yourself Ok I am very much like this guy apart from I know when to fuck off and stop acting creepy  The dude clearly feels lonely  I know this because I am too  I am very confident when it comes to talking to people over Steam and online but I always over think in real life situations and end up just sitting there beating myself up about it  Maybe he has more problems than you think  He wrote those paragraphs to apologize to what he said about killing you I assume and I can only think he is going delusional a little  When I appear a little creepy to people  which I rarely do apart from when my insanity and desperation kicks in  they tend to call me out on my bullshit and to back off a little  in which i do   Idk how you're truly going to handle this since I'm usually the OTHER person  but if you known his parents or someone who is related to him it might be worth getting in contact with them and seeing what's actually going on This is so heavy  What a terrible situation the both of you have been put in   My personal opinion  is that it's not such a bad thing to do internet background checks  However  what they chose to do with the "information" that they found was what I find very wrong  This is a tough situation to be in    I kind of wonder if her parents are maybe feeling anxiety of their daughter being married  and coming up with any odd reason they can  other than just that  to justify being against your marriage   I feel like it's not going to feel right to anyone if you hold this negativity before the wedding  I would do what you can to find peace with the situation  and move on  with or without their blessing Grats on your first time x2    I also think that sex with someone mutually attracted to you could be mind blowing   Also  I've heard that even when 2 people mutually attracted to each other have sex for the first time  it can still be awkward and not great   So you've got to get a girlfriend and do it a few times to get comfortable with each other before it can become mindblowing Ask questions in a sincere manner  like you care about their answer I hope I was able to help somehow  And I wish you well in your endeavors  Well for some reason I can't what've u a norm i e  duck oitbof hereThat's a good idea  the only problem is that I can't cook at all and we don't go out to eat much so I don't know how to try them  Edit  and thank you for taking the time to answer my questionIt sounds like a situation I'm dealing with  My soon to be ex is a pathological liar about the people she talks to  She told me she cut off everyone else she was talking to at the time we started our relationship  I come to find out that she hasn't and has continued the whole time since we started  I think she may be bipolar as well    Please read my thread and let me know if any of this sounds familiar  https   www reddit com r offmychest

he posts on another subreddit I don't know how you made it  did you ever feel like absolute shit because you couldn't get a partner or any other feelings  Got any advice for someone who's almost in the same situation as you Thanks for being a dick but the average is 21 and a 29 is enough for any top level scholarship at any school im looking at   get ready for the normies to come in asking why we just don't hit the club or something  Lol  yes because that's totally the logical thing for me to do here in NYC where the transportation gets fucked to fucking hell by the influx of people

out on sofa   he should barely get anything  But if he had a full fledged idea and can work and help  than more of course  but not 50   fuck that  Maybe max 20  maybe especially if he can't do  much of anything toward making the app from what you said  But I don't know the circumstance and what he saidHappened to me too  Make sure you're using a standard keyboard on mobile  I'm just not having a good last day of 2016  Obviously from my post I don't sound like someone who has good social skills so you expect things to be easy for me  You just trying to make me look retarded If someone calls someone else a bitch it does not mean he is misogynistic  calling him out on it will piss him off more if he actually isn't one  He might be joking  or just a dick in general  If my sister is going ape shit on me I will tell her to calm down  I'm not a misogynist for it  Don't worry about what others think  but if she wants one you should do it for her  Hah  I may do but I won't be telling them lol  And happy new year to you too It's difficult to get on disability payment in Australia and took me over a year  the fact I successfully got on it  without faking or exaggerating anything  must mean something    I can't leave the house alone without having panic attacks  sometimes vomiting and often feeling like I'm going to faint  I need someone to accompany me otherwise I don't know what kind of trouble I could get into   In situations where I have severe panic attacks I become unresponsive and mute    I can't respond to authority such as police  etc   Don't even get me started on getting behind the wheel as that feels impossible at least in the near future   Gotta learn to walk before you can run  and run before you can drive  right   I've tried volunteering  can do a few hours a week as long as I'm taken to and from by family    The places I volunteer tend to be quiet and slow paced environments  low risk and low responsibility but even if I go for a few months I can still feel anxious about going from time to time   I vomited before my third date and had to quickly freshen my breath and get something to eat at a fast food place even though I usually eat healthy   In fact I often vomit or nearly vomit before dates or asking an acquaintance out   I have to try and relax myself before almost any situation related to study work dates etc   The psychologist had said  I quote  "Everyone experiences nerves  anxiety  and such  but for you it tends to be 10x worse "  Anyway  guess it's time to go job hunting  I'm sure I'm equally capable as everyone else    Everyone vomits on their way to the bus stop  everyone freaks out  shakes and can't physically speak whenever their boss gets angry at them  This stuff is normal  right The thing is that I know I'm supoosed to eat meat  but I can't mentally get around the texture   And for fruit it's the taste and how cold it is  I know these are just more stupid excuses to keep being picky  I know the answer seems so simple  but I feel so dumb sometimes  I would eat apples  their flavor is not bad  but if they have any dark or soft spots I freak out  I don't know if this has to do with my ocd but if I see anything like that I have to throw it away  I am so frustrated with myself   Edit  also thank you so much for answering Please seek out your Dr and talk to them about your depression  You can feel better  You might have a chemical imbalance that requires medication  Try to keep an open mind about it and take care of yourself opYou play the hand that life dealt you   If romance is not in the cards  so be it   There are other challenges in life  like   be the best in your field  be successful in a business and make a ton of money  walk the Pacific Crest Trail from Canada to Mexico   The opportunities are endless    It's good to hear from someone who has perspective from the other side of this  I will say  that I understood he was lonely and I really wish I could have been a companion for him to talk to  But on the other hand  I hear about all of these stories of cyberstalking turning into physical stalking  And since I know him in real life     I think he lives with his mom  and I do want to help  but I don't know if I should directly put myself in this situation again  Maybe an anonymous letter Well happy fucking 2017 to you too mate     CheersAnother virgin male here   1  I am about as nerdy as you can possibly get  except for the "do well" in school part  I only did okay in school   But all the other stereotypes I fit perfectly  Shy introverted  scrawny  wear glasses  don't go outside except for work food  work as a programmer  don't care for sports  play video games  watch anime  like sci fi  including star wars and star trek   etc   2  I'm not 30 yet  but I'm close enough  over 25   I think people like Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg have made being a nerd more acceptable in certain parts of the US  but only if you are actually successful  or attractive obviously     In terms of dating  I've noticed that nerdy white guys are fairly successful in my area  but geeky Asian guys still have it very  very tough  I think it's more that online dating and the internet have made it so you don't have to be confined to a small pool of people     Why settle for John from class when you can pick from one of the 400 matches on Tinder go outside everyday  even if it's just standing on the deck I was left with no other option than to join the carnival  So cheers to next year being better  Which for me it won't And it feeeelt so goooodI think t's just that a lot of them don't understand  can't understand   Like depression     Also  this kind of talk belongs in  r Incels imo It's completely your choice  You don't have to do it out of peer pressure  but you can if you think it would be enjoyable for you  Personally  I think you're putting too much thought into it  It doesn't matter whether it looks "cool" or not  Most people like getting drunk because it's fun  as long as you drink responsibly  You don't even need to get drunk either  A lot of people just have a little bit at a time to ease their nerves and help them relax   Alcohol isn't as big a deal once you start drinking it  Hang in there brother I don't think im picky   My current standards are a girl with a pulse   In all seriousness  im attracted to a very wide variety of girls   Skinny  large  tall  short  various races   I'm not really limiting myself anywhere   But it doesn't do me any good  cuz im ugly af You have to eventually understand that you deserve so much more and that you're worth more than being someone's victim  Don't go back   Be strong and walk away for good  Keeping you in my thoughts and wishing you strength  Eh  you know I used to grumble and not care about these holidays as well  Thought it was silly and people got way to caught up in it    Who cares  It's a fun time  Now that I participate in events and "get into it" I find that I have a lot more fun and connect with family friends compared to when I wouldn't participate  That gave me a good laugh which I don't know if that was your intention  but thank you   My point to make is while yes your ideal image is certainly one to strive for  it's not the end of the world if you don't get there  Simply slimming down and toning is also greatly preferred What I would do  I'd be mad  and just not talk to them for a while till they realize you gone  if they don't  then forget em' and get new friends  you don't gotta wait and see while still being thereoh hell yes   i am going to bed with pills long before any of that new years shit is on This man has won 2016  Congrats OPShowers  lots of em  Also luck and decent appearance   Just kidding  But the last 10 stories I have read from so called 'Ex FA's' were just people that never really been FA or just were at the right place right time  You can apologize for screaming and such  but I definitely wouldn't apologize for the actions you took  Something like "I'm sorry I flew off the handle a bit but I still feel like I made the right decision in removing your ability to set off fireworks  You could have seriously injured yourself or someone else  or even set the building on fire  While I understand that you wanted to celebrate  there were far safer ways to do so  I prioritize your safety above all else and don't want to see any of you hurt "It is up to you if you'd like to remain anonymous but the best way to deal with this without worrying if he'll follow you forever is to contact his Mother  I just hope he doesn't come from a broken household because that may be why he is like this  part of my Dad's alcoholism is part of mine  Still  I'd try it  Better to get in contact and show your concern than blocking him off everything  because that'll usually just make him feel shittier  I understand how bad it really must be for you  I apologise if I made it out to be if I were having a go at you because of how he feels because that is not how I was trying to come across as lol I completely understand  I have a bunch of my own that are kept close too  Take care Plenty of people don't like it  Totally fine and normal  Maybe some other forms of intoxication like weed will agree with you more  Okay  everyone else in this thread has given you the standard advice that we both know you already know  you're clearly not an idiot  and you know what you're supposed to be doing  and how to do it  You just don't understand why you aren't    I know how frustrating it can be to get basic good advice that you already know and can't make yourself act on  so please understand  I want to help you break through this  and if you message me I'll give you my   or Skype or something and we can talk and you don't have to be alone when you leave  or while you stay  Okay  But just for a little bit  I'd like you to please work with me here on this     I thought I was before and look how that turned out  I am a weak pathetic fucking idiot woman  I am a fucking stereotype turning statistic  I am going to FUCKING GET KILLED  I know this  So why the fuck am I going to go back   Fuck   Okay  for a moment  let's pretend this is true  You believe it  you're listening to it  so let's take it seriously for just one moment   What is it that makes you  want  to go back  What is it that makes you so afraid of walking away  of living life without him  that makes it so it feels better to risk death to be with him   To put it another way  what would you feel if he got hit by a bus tomorrow  or if he just    changed  Not became better  for you  but just stopped being the horrible psycho that he is  If he became not even a good person  but a morally neutral  emotionally bland and boring one  and just calmly ended it  If he got hit by a bus  Disappeared  Was murdered   What would you feel then  What would you do then  The answers to the question you're really asking  whatever they are  are in  that  place of feeling  of wanting   Like I said  message me if you want to talk  I know you know what to do  and because of that I know you're strong enough and smart enough and brave enough to do it eventually  once you want to do it  and overcome that want  decide to want to do something else  The problem is that right now  you don't really want to  and you need to figure out why you don't   The thing is  it's okay that on some level you don't want to follow the good advice that we both know you know  It's okay to want fucked up shit  learning how to want the right things and let go of wanting the wrong things is the hardest thing humans ever have to learn how to do  so much so that it's very hard to do if you weren't taught it as a small child  But everyone can  Everyone  Even you  Probably especially you  because we both know you understand what he does to you is wrong  and what the "correct" thing to do is  and you understand yourself  and how to control yourself   You'll be able to do it once you want to do it more than you want to stay  so please  think about that and find the reasons that make you want go back  so you can find stronger reasons will that make you want to keep staying away  We already know you can leave  we just have to find what it is that's going to make you want to stay left I got invited to stuff today but I'm so exhausted that I kinda just wish I could be at home and do nothing It is your choice  but as for letting your younger self down    Life is constant adjustment  You don't owe your past self anything and can change your mind whenever you want  Imagine it you promised yourself that when you graduated college  you would go see the BEST most ULTIMATE concert in the world  98 Degrees  You aren't obligated to carry through if your current self has learned something new  Why can't gfs hubs father with fiance Have you ever looked into the eyes of a woman who hates your guts   I have   I would rather be FA  which I have been for decades If he's with you  that tells me that he wants to be with you  and that he's attracted to you the way you are  I obviously don't know the details of your relationship based on these few paragraphs  but I can't really imagine a guy getting into a relationship with a woman whose body type he finds "nasty" or "ugly " I'm really sorry you feel that way about yourself  I've been there  and it sucks  and I hope you don't let it sour a good relationship  assuming it is one  as I said  I don't know the details     If you two care about each other  then each of you deserves the other  Good luck Oh  well that's reassuring  Thank you I live in a small town and my boyfriend's dog goes in between our home and his ex wife's  Right now  she's spending most of her time over there as we're renovating  Not too long ago  we had her over for a visit  we don't keep her leashed in the yard and don't have a fence  never really needed to keep her contained   Well  she ran up to a dog being walked on a leash and right after I yelled  "Don't worry  she's friendly " She just snapped at the dog and kind of started snarling in the dog's face  I had to drag her away and I felt really bad  but I never really thought of the fact that the woman walking her dog could have pepper sprayed our otherwise very sweet  friendly dog  I might consider finding another route to walk if it's a consistent thing in your neighborhood  Dogs are kind of like chemicals  they don't always mix well together  I would definitely consider this but also look after your number one buddy Y'all heard it here first Thank you for the comments   I appreciate the advice  You'll get a certificate in the mail soon  Thank you for your comments   I appreciate the concern  Luck   Circumstance   They just met the right person at the right time   I'm a cop caller  Because even if it isn't sound ordinance curfew  it's still disturbing the peace regardless the hour   And I pay good money to live in my home  Not going to have a day or evening ruined by the inconsiderate You're not an FA  you're an asshole and a "nice guy"  That's the difference between that sub and this one Ye  I got mine out  as an adult  was horrible  because I was getting my adenoids out to help my eustachian tubes work correctly  I asked the doc to take tonsils out also  he said only if I had multiple sore throats a year to which I replied of course I did  so he was then able to take them out too  Sore throats are no longer as bad as before without something to get infected and swell I'll take this under advisement  Thanks  Wish I lived in Montreal Laval Happy New Years  bro     Another year alone   ForeverAlone  Together  Published a couple papers with a few more in the pipeline    Started going to therapy  stopped self harming    Lost a bit of weight  gained a bit of muscle  started wearing contacts and I think I look significantly better  Only realistic goal I have is to get more fit  I had good progress in 2016 from my skinny ass start but I wanna add 7 10 kg more muscle mass at the very least  If I'm gonna be a disgusting virgin failure I wanna console  myself with at least having a great body Some people have many different circles  and it's possible that tonight they feel like being in one of the other circles  I operate this way  but have also felt very left out by other people in the past  From experience  I think that maybe if they knew you were going to be alone tonight  they would have invited you  Don't let this ruin your friendship  OP  You have a very good opportunity to grow from a tough situation  and it will dictate how you deal with more situations like this in the future  Good luck  I hope you find your peace Seek therapy to work through this if it's weighing on your mind  Perhaps someone who is trained in psychoanalysis  I don't much about you but it seems like you've been thru hellish things  Way to go for overcoming them all  You're a fighter and keep winning every battle  But for now  I hope you party first or have some fun  LolNo matter the reasoning for quitting Personal Support Worker  she does all the dirty work Even if I was completely stressed because of a co worker  That's a funny thing to see from someone in  r foreveralone They don't care about you and won't respond back  you'll just seem desperate   so no  Sorry but Happy New Year though I was about to make a goal of mine for 2017 to "talk to a girl " But then I realized that I wanted to keep my goals realistic for this upcoming year  so I just made none Oh no  I think I understood the way that you were trying to come across  I genuinely do appreciate your perspective  I think his dad was abusive but committed suicide a while ago  His mother has always been really nice  I think I'm going to find a way to get in contact with her  But probably anonymously  haha  Thanks If this is something that's bothering you and you feel like you need to process your feelings through  by all means seek out a professional  That's what we're here for As repulsed as I am by food  I'm starving  I wish I was Amanda Nunes right now and knock someone out  but then I'll probably feel bad and start crying like I want to right now either tell him the truth  or believe your own lieAnecdotally  I didn't have any trouble with this because I  the girl and therefore the person traditionally expected to have opinions on this subject  was the one who decided I didn't want an engagement ring  All my now husband had to do was stand there  and radiate a general willingness to do whatever I wanted  while I said so  and nobody thought he was doing anything wrong for not buying me a ring because I manifestly didn't want one  So I think your only real option here for stopping people being judgy at you is to delegate all discussions to your girlfriend  if she can confidently claim that this is 100  what she wants and she hasn't been pressured into it  that'll likely solve your problem   and if she  can't   other people's opinions aren't really your problem  y'know  You have some outstanding advice here  FIL is obviously one who likes to be in control and probably is not wanting his daughter to be married  So he's stirring shit up    I'd do this  Have your parents come over for dinner  and then unbeknownst to them  have her invite her parents over  And let them meet  Poison it   I have three kids   9  5  and 3    my 9 year old helps take care of the other two when I am running around crazy  I think you may be over reacting about her and her nefarious intentions  She's a 9 year old girl and it's a penis  I'm sure she's looking at it because she's never seen one    There is nothing wrong with you or your husband asking one of the other children to help    Yay No problem  Hope all goes well in the end   it doesn't matter when how often but you're not eating enough  i don't know how long you've been doing this but eventually you'll feel pretty sick and tired all the time from not eating enough Why do you think that  One of these are posted almost weekly now  So what if this place isn't positive Yeah you seem like you have it figured out  if he's just unenjoyable to be around theres no reason to keep your foot in the fireI can feel you  I fight with the same things   Bpd and Anxiety mostly  Seriously try to have some good time with your family  You may feel a little better  A long distance relationship can be  very stressful but without knowing details I can't help you much   I wish you a happy new year  Happy New Year to you  too  What's incredible is that you're only 20  Good luck in the coming year  Life is what you make of it  in spite of circumstances  And don't worry too much about the number of women you've been with  the girl that matters  won't care  Cheers  man  I'm number 3888  Happy new year  No problem  We had a similar issue in our house when there was a small break in the line and debris was getting into it  Oh yeah  good ol' comment section  Many sites don't have one anymore though  But there's always YouTube lolI've been there  It hurts  A lot  Sometimes I wished  wish   that I'd been raised religious  so that I'd at least have some hope for an afterlife  but I wasn't  so I really don't  That's a hard thing to come to terms with   This might not be useful to you at all  I'm honestly not sure why it was as useful for me as it was  but thinking about  possible  afterlife scenarios somehow mitigated my fears when they were at their worst  Just thinking "okay  but what if   " and expanding on it  world building in my mind  creating reincarnation situations and stuff  Hell  if you're concerned about the universe ending  pick another universe  You don't necessarily have to believe it  or see it as legitimately plausible at all  it's just   weirdly calming  or at least it was for me  I've considered writing a story about my favorite scenario  I think that's how I started thinking about it in the first place  actually  but that's not the point anymore  The point is that I have something to distract myself from despair when things get bad   Good luck  I hope you find something that works for you soon Thanks  that's really sweet of you to say that  It's posts like these that I really wish outsiders would take notice of  instead of blindly resorting to criticism and name calling  We aren't bad people for getting frustrated sometimes and needing a place to let it all out  At least  I don't think so    Anyway  you're one of my favorite users here so your comment means a lot  You  and most of the guys here  are good people  and I'm sorry that there hasn't been a lady lucky enough to see that  Maybe in another life I could have been that lady for someone here  who knows  I'd "save" all of you if I could  dammit   Here's hoping 2017 brings better things for us Is your girlfriend a senior as well or is she a junior   This isn't really answering your question but just for her benefit  It might be worth it for her to homeschool  You can get the same quality education if she's motivated and willing to work for it  I can't imagine all the doctors appointments and being sick and carrying a baby in a high school environment  People are cruel    I left public school in 10th grade and got an honors diploma a year later  I now  19 F  have an associates degree  It can be done  If you need advice or assistance PM me    I would really think about this right now since the best time to change is at the end of a semester  I left over Christmas break   assuming you're on a block 4 class schedule  That girl was just an asshole  Fuck her i'd like that idea  for academic purposes of courseTotally normal    Remember  YOU get to define YOUR own definition of what "normal" is for you   For me  normal is not drinking or doing any kind of drugs  Popular belief and our media culture leads us to believe that if you're not drinking or smoking  then you're missing out and not having fun or taking part in what the masses are doing  When  to be quite candid  many people  don't  drink on new years    Many people give a holiday power and use it as a reason to have no limits and just be completely silly and irresponsible  Enjoy your sober night     I'd offer to help but I'd probably make things worse    hearing some success stories  No  thank youHowd you get it           We don't have partners but we have each other  That's something  at least     Thanks  Enjoy yours as wellIt's true that pot seems more fun than alchoolI've always likes super sports  but I prefer not sitting like a frog lol  le nice guy meme  This sub is infected with feminists Let's hang outThere's nothing wrong with only eating once or twice a day  so long as you're getting the caloric intake you need for the day   A banana and some tea definitely does not qualify   this will force your blood sugar to go all wonky  it'll also force your body to try to store and reserve more calories as it's tricked into going to famine mode   Which pretty much defeats the purpose if you're trying to lose weight  Okay    the bottom line  and this is going to sound cliche  you have to listen to YOUR heart    It's YOUR life to live  not your parents  I know it can be challenging to weed out the opinions of others when they seem so strong and make good points or suggestions  but the reality is that you have to pursue and follow what your heart and gut is telling you to    Your family isn't going to be attending university  YOU are  Please do what your initial instinct was and if your family is not happy then that is something they have to work with and come to accept  But to not do what you feel for fear of what others think or say is just denying your needs and desires    Happy new year   i've never been hungover before  what is it like I'm playing some vidya myself  so I guess I'll have a drink and be there with you in spirit  I'm sorry SEVERE EAR INFECTION   WAX REMOVAL 2017 The dirty secret is a lot of us don't    I hate to admit it  but I do feel better after a drink  It only takes one for me because I'm small and don't drink often  I get a little light headed  and laugh easier and care less   I only have a drink when I'm feeling particularly shitty and can't escape negative thoughts  like tonight  for instance  It's kind of a last resort because I hate the taste and usually feel a little groggy the next day I am going to try to be happier with the things I have rather than moping over the things I think I ought to have if I  played my cards right "sue the shit out of them in small claims court"Sounds good  you in MD  LolI'm 25 and I've never had a sip of alcohol either  Ultimately it's up to you but my opinion is you shouldn't have to drink alcohol to have fun or to have a social life You look at them and tell them to grow the fuck up   Then you don't think about them again    Screw pretty assholes   man   ALL WOMEN WANT CHAD  Well I learned something about myself today too bad being a fat fuck isn't what women want  BUT FAT WOMEN CAN HAVE ATTRACTIVE SKINNY AND RIPPED GUYS INTO THEM Let me be PERFECTLY CLEAR  you are getting fucked   These are NOT petty issues AT ALL  I'd be shaking mad if I were you   I live in Massachusetts and if you go to full time work to part time work  you can file for unemployment   I'd check on your states rules for this   Look for another job RIGHT AWAY   Keep this one  of course  but start putting together your portfolio now    This is completely unacceptable     DO NOT make the rookie mistake of taking another job on the days that you a scheduled off   They'll schedule you for the days that took the other job and then say 'You worked here first  where are your priorities '   Understand rule  1 about work   It's all about YOU   Your money your growth  your standard of living  PERIOD    This is an opportunity for you  it really is   You will stand up for yourself and that is so impowering  PS Fuck that asshole Jim  I've recently turned off notifications for my messaging app and won't open it until I need it    I know it shouldn't make a difference because no one messaged me anyway but it feels like I'm taking back a small amount of control    No longer messaging people and not getting a reply  No longer checking people's last seen time to decide if they're busy or ignoring me  No longer playing a game I can't win  My time can be better spent   well i'm sure you had boyfriends while in your 20'sGetting healthy is a good but you're not going to get laid a gf just because you have abs  I thought that too years ago and it doesn't help at all if you still have social anxiety and don't talk to people much    I'd also temper your expectations as far as getting ripped goes  unless you plan on juicing it's going to take years to get to where you want We love you and no you don'twow  a lot of doom and gloom on this thread about the impending ruination of your life  i advise you not to trudge into your future carrying this unnecessary burden  the doom  c    yes you're very young to have a baby but you seem fairly resilient  looking to the future rather than bemoaning the past  and resolved to carry on    i was friends with a woman some years ago whose daughter got unexpectedly pregnant in the last year of high school  there was some drama  sure  but the family eventually rallied around   well  except the father  who ghosted    they bought her a condo and helped her pay for day care while she finished her college education  my friend did a lot of babysitting and teaching her daughter how to be a mom  and my friend bitched about it from time to time but here's the deal  everyone in the family loved that baby  and everyone pitched in    difficult timing  but not disastrous in itself   so should you and gf see this through to the child's birth  i advise you to enjoy the hell out of your child's early life  because that time really is gone in a flash    the rest of it  you'll work out       good luck I'm doing it for myself  I know no one will ever love me even if I was attractive  But running and exercise makes me feel better  Sounds sketchy as fuck   Definitely get a new lock Honestly I'm just hoping 2017 some things start bouncing my way  I know exactly how you feel  2016 was a huge shitshow for me too  but as people say  once you've hit rock bottom  there's only one way to go   I've been there  exact same situation  I decided to man up  I just thought of something I can do      goggle the names of folks and see who all have died         who I have out lived   I'm pretty damn old so this could take awhile  love your work OP  Good job mate Okay No I'm in Bama  let's meet halfway It's really simple  You know the answer to this  Get out  The world is a beautiful place with many many beautiful people out there  Trust me  I know this  You are the results of your actions  If you choose to remain in the current situation  then you will continue to be unhappy  Just go Had the same experience not too long ago  I don't know how old you are  but chances are you are around 20  25 ish  Now  the thing that "saved" me was the realization that i had all the time in the world to become another person  The feeling of urgency to achieve something is usually nothing more than that  a feeling  You can't get a great job  a nice family  etc  in an instant    Try to take it slow and do small steps towards your goals  you'll reach them eventually  Everyone has got something they can do like nobody else  so please try and put it to good use   You are not a lover of peace  are you Oh hhheeyyy   Glad I found you all  This is my third New Years in a row alone  Hanging out with my cats and watching movies and drinking   And tomorrow's my birthday  Here's to the best for all of us in 2017 I just did and it got downvoted   r bestof material right hereI've done eight months in the past  Those eight months were pretty good  I lost weight  got a new job  became somewhat social and generally felt confident   Then another rejection made me give up  I don't know if any of the benefits were down to no fap or not but I'm going to try again because my life has become worse than ever    Also I've never combined no fap super powers with my wizard powers  I could  become unstoppable  Got sick of Minecraft already It sounds like you might have more issues  if having a crush makes you so sick you want to vomit  Have you ever tried going to therapy Happy early birthday Let it go  If you can't do this and you're not ready for it  then don't do it  Say no  Your mother is probably worried about your future  and this is her way of trying to make sure that you're provided for  You can provide for yourself  Find a job and save your money  If you're not allowed to work  find a job and say you're going to school  You can take care of yourself  and you can prove it to your mother and yourself  Entering into a marriage or any committed relationship  moving in with someone  before you are self sufficient and know who you are and what you need in a partner is asking for heartbreak and misery  It's your life  Make it what you want it to be  Now is the time  You have your entire life ahead of you  Make it the one you want It sounds to me like the regular combination of soap  and body filth that accumulates in the bathwater   When you take a shower  it runs down the drain  but when you take a bath  the water sits there  in everything you want to rinse off of yourself   Nearly any cleaning product will clean your tub   3941   I feel special now   How can

sayi'n   I can make women laugh up and down the street and do  every day at my work place    It don't make a damn bit of difference  though   still ugly It's completely up to you to do or not  If you do  however  I recommend starting light with your consumption  just try a beer or two  and avoid hard liquor on your first go  Should help you from getting super drunk  unless you can't hold your alcohol very well   Of course there's always the possibility you may just not like how alcohol tastes and will choose to avoid it anyway  like me I'll be home alone with my cat  I have a little wine left and a lot of snacks so it should be OK    Maybe I'll get Uncharted 4  Good distraction keep it p and make sure she comes first  and frequently  you won't regret it Sounds like there's more going

him and it sounds like he is comfortable enough to open up about personal issues and enjoys hanging out with you  Guys are not as complex as you probably think    If I were you  I would just look for more opportunities to hang out with him outside of class or school related activities  Maybe go see a movie or go out for a drink somewhere Sounds to me  according to the framework provided  that youre doing activities for the sake of becoming social  instead of doing something you enjoy that involves other people  Idk  maybe find something that only has one or two other ppl instead of a large group  We're not experts here  try a variety of approaches   TLDR  Sounds like you should try more things you enjoy i'm sure its much more common than you think  most likely happens to guys more than girls because girls don't have to be the initiatorsAt least you get invited lolSounds to me like youre problem lies more in staying in the coversation  You should practice asking questions  When ppl seem like theyre ignoring you  try interjecting with questions that actually steer the conversation I agree with egobot  I needed four Which state and city Agree with  u JuliaH7931  Best to explore these issues with a qualified therapist   The idea of repressed memories of childhood abuse has been pretty much discredited IIRC  The "recovered memories" in many cases turned out to be fabrications Are you referring to cod liver oil  Or fish oil  the latter I believe has minimal amounts of vit D Sorry to hear that happened  But kudos  on you for asking him out  Rejection sucks but it's better than never asking in the first place  I changed my brothers diaper when I was 6  I wanted to help my mom out since she was napping  Thank you for the kind words  Its the fact that I don't have someone waiting for me when I get back more than the letters The correction  and telling them to re read is fine  but just drop telling ppl how they will feel Have a suggestion for the interrogation phase   2 second pause after hearing each question  breathe out  then answer quietly but clearly  void of emotional challenge I hope  Thats one of the reasons I joined as I heard Marines are a big brotherhood I was dumped three days before my picnic on the new years eve  I'm sorry  but you're an asshole    Here lately  when I dont feel it comes from a genuine place I just say 'Thank You " Im from the bible

isolation is normal and fine  Happens all the time when you graduate and start guiding your own life  But you make new friends and such typically  Seems like this was happening to you and you also had the shit luck of ending up in this relationship    I have pretty low standards but it doesn't really matter because im never going to get into a situation where it matters lolAhhh  to be young and in love and in Berlin   Edit  inDamn  I feel so bad for you  This sounds like a shitty situation to be in  How long have you known the friend that invited you  How long have you been at the wedding dinner already My goal  really my number one  critical goal for 2017  is to walk into a psychiatrist's office  and be bluntly honest    I have kinda that foreboding feeling  that this is my last

well  Mine are yellowish because there are tons of fluoride in water and many people who grew up in this town have shit teeth because of that  People think I don't brush  I brush circles around you fools  It doesn't matter  My dentist says it won't whiten  and I ain't got no munny for more sophisticated stuff Agreed  This is the simplest approach with OPs fiancee doing the driving in this manner  It reduces the chance of getting caught in the crossfire between her and her folks  I wouldn't doubt that FIL can push some buttons but the fiancee knows what to expect whereas OP doesn't  Sadly  the smallest I've been in my adult life is 16 18  Even though I worked out  dieted  would even starve myself  I could not drop my size to anything below that  Hence why I'm working with my doctor and

story is they were late bloomers who did normie stuff and it worked out for them or they got lucky and girlfriended married the first woman who showed interest in them I don't know what advise to give  but here's an internet hug sorry for bad wrigting I will thanks Well they're my favorite football team and gives me joy The rings are about her and for her  so she gets to decide what happens  ayooo     but in seriousness  toys or just go out and get some  Don't be afraid of your sexuality  Just be safe about itNice shaming That's interesting  I was under the impression that repressed memories were entirely legitimate   I hope OP figures out what he feels like is an issue   complains about feminism    complains about being shamed   Hmm    I feel ya  Good luck out there  though  Maybe you'll make a bunch of normie friends at Basic and end up busting out of FA after all The man's trying to make some change in his life  Let him be I'm really happy for you  I really hope you have a great

 Property management tends to lag to the point where minor fixes are just worth solving for myself   Thanks again That much chocolate won't hurt your dog  To my knowledge it takes an ounce per pound

worst  It is not bad at all  There is a saying that the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step  You are at least taking small steps to improve  thats at least better than doing nothing  So what are your resolutions  Mine is to drink more water  Thats step 1 for me in my journey to lose weight and be more healthy Lol  Good Please go on   all I can ever manufacture to say is something very generic   "the beer is nice"  "it's so loud in here"  "how's your night going " etc   That's actually perfectly fine  I say stuff like that and people say stuff like that all the time as well  The problem is  you  think it's a problem and get self conscious about it    The way out of this is to realize that  if you do indeed say something stupid or others think you're too boring or whatever  you have to  own  it  If you are comfortable with it  then what others think won't bother you  That will help you overcome your worry and self consciousness  Ironically  you'll then speak alot more effortlessly and come across as less socially awkward  So the saying "it's all in your head" is actually true I got mine out due to constantly getting sore throats every year  I had what they called kissing tonsils  They were so big that they touched each other at all times  I haven't had a traditional sore throat in 20 years  Just the occasional mild sore throat from sinus draining  I love drinking orange juice when this occurs Which side is the crazy side Haha  I thought you meant mlb giants  Everybody's body responds differently too  I've never been much of a drinker and only ever really had a couple of social drinks  It was never something I particularly liked or enjoyed so didn't actively seek it  I used to prefer vodka because it was easy to disguise but always had a few side effects even from just a couple of light drinks  Later on I realised that I had an intolerance to potatoes so I was giving myself a double dose    I also have something of a histamine intolerance now so my body cant handle it anymore  What you might be feeling could be something like that  As much as it has a socially acceptable image  it isn't what you would call healthy and we are all built differently Thank you   I will be take a vacation from Tumblr  Instagram and parts of Reddit  gotta keep tabs on some subs for health reasons There are some issues there and none of us really want that at all How am I supposed to know what's normal  I'm alone on new years eve  haven't had a girlfriend in a year and am way too old to be getting into fights on the internet  I hope that what you're experiencing ends and you become happy in every situation  Have a happy new year   Should I confront him physically   No Can you point out the inaccuracies in this account please  Where is she wrong in this instance  I've gone to all of my friends weddings alone   It sucks but the best you can do is smile and be happy for them on their night Yeah I'm from NY I'm sorry that happened to you  But everyone has a breaking point  and once past that decisions aren't really as thought out when compared to the result from those decisions     Dumping someone compared to focusing on myself so I can start getting my life together     Of course it's shitty and could be done in a better way but people are different than you in every sense  Don't even worry about that douche  do just you  To you   but the science is still out on effects of gmo crops in their respective  localities  I agree that eating gmo crops is safe   Do you need someone to talk to  I'm sorry  do you want to talk about it Then I suggest waiting  Don't make any decisions until you are sure  If you are never sure  then so be it  I'm pretty sure you can ask to have a photo of you taken off facebook  Check their policiesI'm going through a similar thing  I recently realized I tend to be too pushy  persistent  and sometimes aggressive when pursuing friends or romance  Honestly  no one is perfect at communicating  We're all just pushing our sausage fingers into a glowy thing in the hope that someone else is listening    There are other people that have posted actual tips on this thread  I am not one of them  Damn  I saw this too late  Would have gone with you but I literally got off work at 8Any other ideas  I understand how you feel  but maybe try baking apple slices with a bit of cinnamon on them  Should be very bearable and tasty at that point  If it doesn't work out  let me know  I'll come up with a few things  That's not halfway Good luck and have lots of fun Thanks so much I promise I'm not knocking him at all and I apologize if it seemed like I was I am on that road also  Only thing I am getting clear is that I am a sensitive person and have to focus on people   I am bisexual   that is sensitive and considered  don't waste a second with people that is harsh  dumb  or a combination of that  and favor humanity over beauty If it's any consolation  staying home  watching TV  and drinking is basically my plan too What are you looking for  You say you don't want to be the type to seek revenge or hold onto a grudge  that you don't want to let a thug like him have an impact on your life  It sounds to me like you already know what the best course of action is Well  I regret nothing  I had them out when I was 31  ish   because I was sick of dealing with tonsil stones every day  I used to have what I thought were terrible allergies  runny nose  stuffy sinuses  sore throats  etc  but that cleared up after the tonsils and adenoids came out    I'm all for science and stuff but I'm sure glad I did it  thank youPeople absolutely do respond to physical appearance   To a depressing degree   There is actual research on this   As a woman  it's striking how differently  better  people treat me when I do the full makeup  skirt  jewelry  etc thing and better fit the mold of what our society considers attractive   So of course I do that when I want that advantage   BUT  it makes me respect those people less  for being such superficial dumbasses   Sometimes I wonder how different my life would be if I worked harder to be "hot" or whatever   I'd have more people in my life but probably not quality people Idk  It's been like four days and I cannot stop thinking about it  He used to make lots of plans for us and now he just removed me from Facebook  I did nothing before or after that   I'm really sad    I would drive to his home and wait till tomorrow to see him  or to his work  But he's not like me  He hates this kind of things  these romcom scenes  I'm a hopeless romantic crying for him at the new years eve and for him there's no coming back  It's good that you now know where it all began  The feeling you get when things finally begins to take shape is amazing isn't it  I'm glad for being able to help  Frankly speaking  my new year has so much more meaning because of this comment dialogue  Thank you for sharing with me    And now that you have started to put things together  you should get your self esteem back  Finish this process that you have started  You will feel in charge of your life in no time  Now  it won't be all glossy and shiny  It might be  You might get an adrenaline rush  It's amazing when that happens  I love adrenaline  But remember to not be afraid and start questioning everything once the adrenaline wears off  And feel free to talk to me anytime you want to  If no one else  just talk to yourself  That's the one person you can always count on being there for you    A very happy new year to you darling   Thanks  Ill update in 13 weeks The problem a bad relationship can cause you is NOT just emotional  but financial and legal   Many divorced men become destitute or homeless when divorce court imposes impossible alimony and child support  Some men are falsely accused of rape and spend years in prison  It can be much much worse than being alone  That was the reason I chose FA decades ago  In my book if you dident do this your pretty much a lameGod I wish I could make this THE post of the year  I've been in this exact situation before and it hurts more than anything feeling so alone while surrounded by a shit ton of people  No one cares who you are  you're just invisible to them  And the best part  When you try to explain to normies they refuse to understand My plans with friends fell through  Girl drama is the worst  Most likely going to cry myself to sleep tonight  In NYC  Absolutely    NYC is where you go when you don't want to stop the party  Being from NY  I know a few people that have that exact plan  You leave before it burns you out though It's really down to what OP feels  but I wouldn't do more than 5    An idea is not worth shit  Ideas are dime a dozen  It is implementation and execution that matter   really nice  What an understatementGood luck not getting her pregnant I am assuming you have some hobby relaxing activity that can at least even out some of the tension  right  Having an outlet is important She's a junior and has been considering home school before any of this happened  I'll discuss this with her as well  Thank you so much for reaching out  Hey  The liberty of having Internet friends is you can be anyone you want to be  Who cares what they think  Be who you want and do what you want  No need to be embarrassed   Everyone does their own humming and dumb stuff too Yes  it all worked fine i tottaly got over most of it  am almost thankfull that it happened  i forgave myself some time ago but i can't seem to forgive him in any way  and thats still affecting me for sure  I feel like smashing his face in when i think about itBetter than celebrating a year full of disapointment  at least for me No matter the reason  You should have went to your boss or HR Ilife there was problems   Congratulations  you are transgender  PM me or go to r asktransgender if you have any questions  Use the code UJ2D74 for your complementary pickle jar  Edit  that may have come across as insensitive  But seriously I would see a gender therapist It's an illusion  I swear  I only seem like I have a plan  I'm winging it  But I'm trying to get it done  1  I'm too scared to kill myself  2  I don't want to put my parents through that kind of pain   3  I have a tiny smidge of hope that things will get better and it's enough to keep me around   4  Distractions  I distract myself with everything that I do  be it work  uni  movies etc just so I think about it less   If it's any consolation  you have a whole  fresh  clean new year to explore and find something even better Dude    the cops won't use your name  I call the cops for stuff all the time  I see a drunk driver  I call  I see road racers I call  It's just so they have a name  Trust me  They won't document you and make a file on your ass Well  I'm not eating an ice cream cone  so your New Year's Eve is already way better than mine It seems that you think that something is "wrong" with spending your time alone  Why is that  Why would spending time with yourself be worse than being all alone in a loud  obnoxious environment  If anything  I think it's sad that someone would have to DEPEND on other people for their own entertainment  It means you can't even enjoy yourself   And also tell me  what are you "getting from the night" apart from bleeding eardrums and horrible alcoholic breath Horror movies don't scare me  unfortunately Not many positive things have happened to me  One thing I can think of is that I got my first sales on my Etsy store in 3 years  https   www etsy com uk shop KokoroCards   I also went to Paris in the summer for one night  all I could afford   My first time overseas Yeh yeh she ain't a perv at her age  She just wants to help her little brother and it's we ridden cause he's got a weird thingy and she don't  Fucking white knight Good job  But don't worry    20 is young as hell  you have so much time it's not even funnyI know she's not your kid so you don't really grasp it  but that's her kid brother   Seek professional help please  Not us reddit professionals It's not an issue because everybody is consenting  everybody is safe and everybody knows what they're doing  Assuming that they're doing it properly  of course   I would never in a million years lay a finger on my boyfriend  but I sometimes have days where I'm a switch and I'm feeling dominant  For me  it's a very maternal feeling and the punishment feels playful for the both of us  On the flip side  it's the exact same case    and  quit saying "can't function move" as if that's some catch all term for disgustingly messed up  abusive acts  I don't know if you're intentionally generalizing but there's a huge  huge difference between abuse taking it too far  and being "unable to function" because your ass is too sore  or because you've had a particularly intense session that'll take a day or two to recuperate from   Also  very seldom does masochism have anything to do with straight up beating  it's often whipping smacking  pinching pulling and awkward positions  that are being slowly worked up towards  A dom doesn't just drag his sub by the hair into their bedroom  beat the living daylights out of her and then fuck her  A good dom knows how to do the BDSMM equivalent of foreplay and will bend over backwards to make sure that their sub is okay   I get that you're focusing less on BDSM and more on fetishes as a whole  but that's still pretty off  So what if a fetish or kink will occasionally affect you outside of hot n' heavy times  It's not like normal sex can't do that  It's pretty standard for people to leave sex "glowing"  unable to sit down or generally hot and bothered  I don't see the issue  I guess Thanks Lol  Learn to drive one handed yo Already back at home   Already back homeMe too  Not at this exact moment  but yesterday  a few days before that  every day for two weeks awhile ago    It comes and goes  I just told someone they had their whole life ahead of them to make what they wanted of it  And I realized that's still true for me too  It doesn't matter if you're 19  30  60  or 85  You still have the rest of your life  Everyone's situation is different  But your life is yours  If you're not satisfied with the results of your decisions  try making a different one than normal tomorrow  See how it goes  I've made some different ones  Some help  some don't  Pay attention  Keep what works   I agree  I called the non emergency number and they said they'll get someone out when they can  That was over 3 hours ago  And they're still setting off some serious stuff that is rattling my windows  So they either didn't show up  or the dbags around here ignored them  Ironically  the Sheriff's office just enacted special

You literally can't stand up for yourself as an adult without getting beaten   That's pure wrong     I'm not saying you're a saint  but your father is out of control   He may be "honorable " but he's damaged and is doing his best to pass the damage on  as abused people  and he was one  usually do   He probably convinced himself he's "being a man '  But it is wrong for him to hit you simply for disagreeing   There is no excuse   It is wrong   Frankly I don't have good advice    You can keep taking it  you can avoid him  stay away as much as possible  you can tell your teachers  who are bound by law to tell the cops and then who knows what will happen   But I don't know  maybe a foster home is better than this shit   Hopefully  I will too  I mean  I love this particular woman more than life  but she doesn't want me anymore  So what's the point of being alive without love  And I doubt I will ever find love like her's again  I haven't loved anyone like that   ever  I was even married for 14 years  until she cheated on me   I can't get interested in another woman enough to even find out  I have no children and will end up old  alone   in a nursing home  more than likely   So  I'm ready to go  I tried to get God to take me a few times this year  but nothing  I don't believe in suicide  because it's murder  So it has to come without any intervention on my part  I'm ready to go

URIs 3 4 times a year  It's been over two years and she has had one bad cold since  The ENT doc said her tonsils had more crevasses in them than normal which harbored a bunch of viruses bacteria  Long story just to say things aren't always cut and dry  I had to go to my sister's wedding alone and i had to be in it  After the ceremony  as the bride  groom  bridesmaid  groomsmen  and immediate family walked up the aisle  i had to walk out of that front row with eyes all on my up the aisle all by myself  Felt like one of the worst moments of my life   It probably won't change much of the advice but

comments 5ldjdn im finally doing it update  Ah  a woman's instinct is strong indeed  but you need strong evidence in case she ever tries to act on her feelings  I think you should just try and separate your bf and your bff from each other  Do you think your bff would act on her feelings Future reference  do a tldr   I read about 90  of it  Let me try to help a bit and make things as clear as I can  I  also  am 25   also have a sister who is 19  close to 20 so u and I can kind of relate    My sister doesn't live with me  I won't let her move in for this reason  I am not her mother and I refuse to tell her what to do    You're mothering your sister  Knock it off  Your sister is 20  she will grow up on her own time line and she will do what she pleases when she wants to  If she pays her portion of the bills then leave it at that  You could ASK her to help with doing things but her bedroom that she pays for is none of your business and her laundry problem isn't your problem to worry about either   If you've already established that she isn't coming with u and your kid and husband then let things be until the move and tell her ahead of time so she can make arrangements  Thank you for the idea  I'll try that    it means a lot Oooh that actually sounds really good  Thank you  it really helps  you seem so kind and patient All you can do then is file a complaint at the station  File one about the neighbors and file another about the seemingly long or no response  Nothing will likely happen  but it will be on record at least  That way they have a pattern for next time  Presumably July I mean  you're right   Guess I was just looking for opinions people maybe in similar situations or with similar feelings   Not necessarily seeking "help"   Yep exactly what I've noticed  Also because serial monogamy for a lot of us just feels better  I notice a lot of semi break ups    Like  you never moved in with the person  but you two just "fade out" and go your own ways after a month or two of dating  as you move on to others    Then sometimes you may get back with someone else again from before  who knows  The alternative is sex with lots of strangers  Sure it sounds great in the fantasy of porn  but in reality    I'm not so sure  I tried it a couple of times  I remember hooking up with a girl and for all intents and purposes it was supposed to be a one time only thing since she lived in another country  But of course  we felt super awkward afterwards given those conditions in effect  In fact realizing what she was doing  she felt ashamed and wouldn't talk to me  So instead we ended up becoming friends on Facebook and talking frequently  This was now like 6 years ago and we still chat sometimes  we have similar tastes in music   So yeah even one attempt at anonymous hooking up didn't work for me  If you have any interest in hanging out with the classmate who texts you  you could try texting her back and say something like "That sounds like fun  I should totally go with you guys next time " Or you could try texting someone else if you have their contact info  It doesn't always work  but sometimes it does   I have read from so called 'Ex FA's' were just people that never really been FA or just were at the right place right time    That's not true  I did a lot self improvement and worked really hard to mean new people  normieI can see you've put alot of effort in this post and have great ideas  but I don't think this is the best way of following them  I know that we have FA meetups here every now and then  or do we  I don't remember  but wearing something like a badge singles us out even more   Another big problem with this is that even if I identified another FA  what would make me want to talk to them  I know some people like me are deathly afraid of talking to strangers and have panic attacks just thinking about it  Hell I can barely keep up conversations with normal people there's no way I can go chat up with someone else  even if they are FA  To be honest the thought makes me very uncomfortable   Either way  I think there should be an easier way to interact with other FAs in real life  but I can't really think of one Happy New Years to you too    Move on and grow up Can you tell us more about your background  What's your life like  Might help us with our answers  Also  happy New Year     You do realize you're literally acting like the stereotypical neckbeard and "nice guy"  right  If this is who you truly are  then this is the reason you're FA  plain and simple This is something the both of you need to discuss and agree upon  My fiance and I don't believe in marriage   Ironic because he is my fiance  lol    We are engaged but the whole engaged to be married thing   not us  My ring was a  200 walmart ring I chose  I lost it  neither of us were too upset and now I found rings we both like for  30 a piece online  It's not about being engaged  it's about feeling connected to one another when we aren't together  Kind of a commitment  loyalty  connection ring  Idk how to explain it  I'm not a traditional woman by any means so I see where you're coming from    Also  if it's just a ring she wants   don't go blowing 10 fucking k on it  Lol  Spend 10k elsewhere dude  That's absurd I pretty much just had a smoke and some snacks  then went to sleep  Of course  until I got woken up by next door and ended up watching science fiction shows  Some good shit on TV right now  shame everyone else is missing it   To be fair  I was going to go out  but then I found out nobody else is going and I just got back from visiting family in Austria  so I've got some pretty bad Jetlag  and I'm still disappointed from going back to gross British coffee    My best friend is coming over tomorrow anyway  the only reason we're not dreading the new year together is because they're having their weekly horrific migraine  Their new year is probably much  much worse Prehistoric times   "You  me  sex "  https   www youtube com watch v myvaeC f95o Move on Well  are you okay with him sleeping with other women  Can you love him even if he isn't monogamous  because he doesn't seem to be living that lifestyle  happy new year guys  Both my sisters out with their husbands    I really wish I had a girlfriend  This sucks  but gl next year Looks is what gets people interested in the first place  you fall in love with someone's personality after you fall in love with someone's look  There's no fix to this  it's purely biological  And it sucks Still two FA guys in that clip It seems wrong to use people like that Congrats   Happy new year  I am not okay with it  I'm not sure I'm capable of being in an open relationship  You started some shit with a guy  he beat you up  You used it for motivation   Now you want to go back and stir up more shit   You haven't been in a fight since  That's a good thing  If you've stopped threatening people then that guy did you a favor Hey man I'm in the same boat  Wanna grab a drink  There was once a time when men pretty much bought their wives off of their families  but you still had to have money and the relationships probably weren't  particularly  healthy   You'd probably be finding books more along the lines of "How to murder your husband and run away with the hot neighbor guy" Ok I will try to talk more and make some thing happen  Thanks for the reply  I have tried the cold approach many times  it didn't work Never  ever  be someone's second choice  We're you wrong for going through his phone  Technically yes  but he's cheating on you which is a lot worse   You need to confront him about it  Sure he makes you happy and makes you laugh  but if he's not fully invested in your relationship  you need to leave him You're not alone in this  You sound like my fiance and I sound like yours  Literally  to a T  We've both been at our wits end and thought that the relationship just wasn't worth sacrificing our time or energy for anymore but we're working on it and decided that the way we actually feel towards one another is more important to work on versus walking away and starting all over again with someone new    What it comes down to is whether you truly love this woman or if you're trying to convince yourself that you truly love her  There's a huge difference between love and lust  in which I am sure you know now  Love isn't easy man  Not by any means  You have to work on it  work for it and want it more than anything    Show her more affection  Seriously  Do it  It'll make a world of difference  Dedicate time to her  without technology  Turn off both of your phones  take her to the park on a starry warm evening and have a late night dinner at 2 am  Plan dates she has no idea about  Do something  It sounds like the spark has been lost between the 2 of you  This is the issue between my fiance and I   Matter of fact  I packed all of my clothes and my son's clothes last night because I was just done with it all  Within 24 hours my fiance has made me fall in love with him all over again  How  Small changes  He use to not kiss me and show me he wanted me before I left for work  Today however   he let me sleep in as late as I needed before I had to get ready for work  when I was getting ready he'd grab my butt and call me sexy and actually flirt with me  He tried to put me in a good mood and the way he kissed me    he hasn't kissed me like this for years    Small changes make BIG differences  You do need to share with her how you feel though  And she needs to tell you how she feels as well because I can promise she has some emotions she's holding back  Just report it  Select the "other" option  and state why you are reporting it  We tend to check out anything that gets reported  and especially anything that gets several reports  We don't care if you put "he sounds like a dick" in the report reason  we will check it out anyways and remove if necessary From what I have read  typical antidepressants  SSRIs  plus Wellbutrin  do not affect intelligence   But prolonged use of anti anxiety meds like benzos  Ativan xanax etc  are proven to cause long term brain damage and impaired cognitive functioning   Google for the details  and decide if it is worth it for you Ive tried being "more confident bro"  ive "hit the gym brah"  ive "shaved brah"  ive "grown a beard brah" etc etc and swarms of women have not come to me yet   happy nye to you too dude  You sound like a good bloke  hopefully 2017 is a better year for all of us It has nothing to do with looks  Nope  nope    Daily reminder plenty of misogynists get mad pussy  Broke my heart while reading this  but it's so true   But where will he go  He's supposed to stay here until March  I'll feel bad for just throwing him out on the street You're most welcome  Happy new year to you both   Even if someone oozed confidence but was still lacking in the looks department he would be constantly rejected left and right   Can confirm  this is pretty much a description of my life Contact the Department of Health and Human Services for your state  Resources will be listed on the website  There may be involuntary hospitalization options  though that can be difficult  Adult protective services may also be an option    You may need to realize that you can't control another adult or help her if she doesn't want help  You may need to keep your distance or limit your time with her to protect yourself   I just decided to do what I knew wouldn't lead to me being upset or angry and drank by myself at home  I can't even go outside anymore without wanting to throttle someone You are you  That is enough  It really is https   i ytimg com vi yjk7SgxNCjQ maxresdefault jpg if you get the referenceIt does help but only temporarily though  because once you are back to sobriety it all goes back to shitIs it    Is it  It can help a little every now and then for some people  but for a lot of people it can actually made depression worse  Drinking alone or regularly is far more likely to make it worse I had completely resigned to never meeting anyone to spend my life with  I found someone that I hit it off this October  And while it didn't work out for various reasons  it made me realize that these things pop up at the weirdest moments In my opinion  probably the best thing about 2016 is that it's over now I threatened him after the fight  i didn't start it up he grabbed me from a beer line and instantly punched me didn't even see him  I become somewhat illiterate apparently when i talk about this subject still  It's hard for me to express it exactly cause of all the things i told myseld thru the years  this should explain the situation a bitIt's because most lack the social skills  I think a lot of people would be surprised at how easily you can intimidate a dog  Growing up I would walk my dog all the time and we would often encounter aggressive dogs roaming around on their own  One of these dogs came running up to mine and was acting like he was going to bite my dog's neck  Both dogs were very large  but I stood up tall and yelled at the dog  He backed off a tiny bit and I stared him down while I pulled my dog further away from the aggressive one  Be confident  be scary  don't show the dogs any signs that you are afraid    Also  another piece of advice  When I am walking my dogs and I notice a dog in the distance I pretend I don't see it  More than half of the time if I don't pay attention to it  neither will my dogs and when the other dog doesn't get any reaction out of the others it will usually go on its way  Your dogs rely a lot on the way you are feeling  If you're nervous they're going to be too  but if you feel relaxed and comfortable they will also   Maybe get some distance if you're finding it hard   Yes that's exactly his problem  Couldn't resist   I agree with your advice Sorry  it's just very difficult to be taken seriously when you have mental disorders and not a physical disability  let alone 'anxiety' which as a word is so overused the severe sufferers can never be taken seriously  I just don't think this is the place to dismiss anxiety disorders though as many FA have genuine social anxiety disorder diagnosed by a professional and such which really affects their lives  Thanks for the kind words and you too I did have another submission on this subreddit  One thing that I've learned about all the experiences I had was instead of being bitter  I've learned to become more compassionate about others  We all have different battles and we need to be more understanding about others  Don't let the evilness of the world blind you to see that there's still goodness left and the world is still beautiful to live in  When the world is unkind  be kind enough  I did have a blast last night  To drive off the negativities and evil  as a cultural tradition   I had a casserole and a spoon to create noise as noisy as possible last midnight  hahahaha  Alcohol helped me by being more social  Which girls like  But I like weed more  Just more healthier  You should come clean to her  Explain it to her exactly like it is on this thread  If she reacts negatively then it confirms your suspicions  if not then she may be unintentionally acting this way  or getting carried away trying to feel like she has a big friend circle  Honesty is always the best policy in these kinds of situations  I've found    shower obsession  Still haven't gotten old for me  HNY  7 AM here  very quiet Maybe take up a form of meditation and above all  let yourself be happy  Let everything that bothers you go  Don't let logic get in the way just breathe and let yourself be happy You're using chrome  reset your passwords  and you won't have to worry  All you need is a few seconds I think you're overreacting  they probably thought it was funnyAnxiety  I have it  I take medication for it  It sucks  well i'm pleased this wasn't a tale of suicideClearly you were doing it wrong brah Can you go into details please  Where  What did you say  Them  Etc  I'm extremely interested in this Fairest thing  Tell him exactly what you said here  If he's been patient with you so far  he might be willing to wait it out   I say wait it out because there's no better time to bring it up with your therapist  That's what they're there for  to talk about problems   tried it  it "worked" if the goal is to speak with some random stranger for 10 minutes  however  if the goal is to form any kind of lasting  meaningful connection then it failed miserablyIt breaks my heart that I'm still single and people are getting treated poorly in other relationships  Like  no one asks to get cheated on   As for kicking him out  honestly  I would because he lied on three different occasions  but realistically that won't sit well with anyone   Just talk to him and say that you want to break things off with him because he's obviously not committed to your relationship  For safety concerns  I'd have a friend with you when you confront him Just FYI  AAA and a lot of local groups taxi services will do free rides on NYE and other holidays   so people don't have to drive drunk or pay crazy uber surge prices  So you can keep that in mind for next time Just alone in my room empty place I live in I wish I had someone with me but I don't just listening to music the only thing that brings me joy in the world Can confrim  used to work for AAA  They'll tow your car and take you home Why  What happened What is the reason  Is your cousin a bitch  Kind of seems like itI can relate  Happy New Year o ok brah ill try doing it right next time brahYeah I feel like I'm wasting the time half the time it's not response Uhm yeah  leave  Get the f out of that relationship now  You're only hurting yourself  Once a cheater  usually always a cheater  This is the THIRD time and you're asking for advice  Girl  know your worth congrats  my mom is the only one who has called me so far  technically it's not 2017 for another 45 minutes in my time zone  so i'm gonna wait by the phone for additional calls This sounds like great advice  I'll try it  Thanks very much Rich and powerful  charismatic  and he didn't look like a potato  I have none of these things going for me Yes  He is not protected by rule 2 since rule 2 is for FA'ers only  Alright man  Happy new years Happy New Years I'm a total nerd  I don't care  I'll be a fracking nerd if I want Maybe a more practical first step would be putting your city in your flair Thank you very much hahaNo its just her friend is only 18 and still with her parents so it was the parents rule that they could celebrate but no driving or guys over  all I get is being ghosted  guys over 60  or guys 10 states over   Not sure if this is actually what the gay community is like in general  or I just relate so closely that I don't know anything else Thank you You mean more scary  I mean this  dude understandably is kinda in shock but his post is making think me think he doesn't quite get it  He seems to think he is still going to carry on and do as he planned  That it's totally cool that he's gonna rely on mommy and daddy  I feel bad for him because he's kinda fucked unless he makes some difficult sacrifices and works his ass off  Midnight hit and the fireworks went off  I stupidly turned on the TV and saw the couples kissing which hit me in the feels  Everyone is having fun out there and I'm here alone pathetically sobbing  This is hitting me directly in the feels  Good for you man  Way to start the new year off right  I tried the whole bar club scene and that didn't work  I have tried the cold approach in stores   I would tried to talk with girls   Most of the time they were not interested   A few times when it did go well they already had a boyfriend or I wasn't able to take things further Thanks  You seem nice as well  I doubt 2017 will be better for any of us but maybe we will get lucky  It's doubtful considering our past  so I'm just hoping a few of us make it out  I see other people sitting alone in coffee shops and whatnot  Sometimes I wonder  maybe I should just walk up to them and ask if I can join them  There's probably about X   of people that would be extremely happy to have somebody to talk to  and Y   of people that would wonder why tf is this creep talking to me     What do you think the X and Y values are   At least if you're a gay guy you can still get laid whenever you want  I mean  if it's going to be with that 60 year old dude in the corner with genital warts then sure    Haha  thanks  Yeah  it's 12 25 am here in The Eastern US You too I don't think I'd be interested in advertising this in public  I think you're suggesting that it wouldn't be common knowledge  but we're not a secret society  people would find out   I'm also not too inclined to try to befriend someone  just  because they're lonely  There are a handful of regular users here who seem cool  and I'd really like to talk to them more  but there are also people here who drive me nuts  Simply being the FA bucket doesn't mean we're automatically going to like or relate to each other    I am a bit hesitant about posting this but my counsellor keeps saying that I need to be more confident   Sorry if I'm kind of shooting down your idea  I hope this doesn't make you feel shitty  It's just my dumb opinion Maybe it's selfish   I think I'm afraid that he will move on and I'll be left with nothing  But leading him on isn't right  either  That is something I've never even thought about  So trippy This hits close to home  I'm truly sorry OP  I know how painful it is to feel like you don't belong anywhere  I've had a few similar experiences to the ones you've posted and more that still haunt me everyday  Things that happened when I was 12 that I still think about at 3AM at 20    I think the worst thing is that I haven't changed  I'm still the lonely  awkward  and unconfident kid I was back then  hoping that a girl might like me one day  Hoping that I could change myself enough to make that a possibility  I feel exactly the same about the majority of what you've said    If you ever need to talk to someone or share experiences and thoughts with  I'm always online  I get acne because my hormones are fucked  and I have really sensitive skin  I was the kid that was allergic to facepaint  for fuck's sake  so I can't use any kind of products that help with it  The only thing that can touch my face is plain  unscented  uncolored soap Sorry  that's painful   But    I hear a ton of implicit beliefs in your missive    Things which you think are real or true  which shape your experience and interpretation of life    things which "tell you who you are" but rob you of freedom and true self  and leave you alienated in your own world  unable to experience satisfaction  unable to be at home with life  trapped in a past based identity and cut off from the natural richness of being yourself   I love the fact that you're tired of hiding    That's about 40  of the battle right there    "Breaching the ego's walls" is an expression that is apt    the Dark Side of each human is something that we generally want to hide or dress up  in order to conform to social norms    But that hiding makes it very difficult to penetrate into the nature of the darkness and see through it clearly   So sharing is exactly the right thing to do    But it's not the end of the road  by any means   In general  the road has two invariant rules   you need self awareness  and you need courage   The self awareness shows you where you're trapped  and the courage is needed because when you understand a trap  you see that it takes courage to leave it behind    The traps generally come with some kind of addictive bait that keeps you from just opening the door and walking out   You have to be brave to leave the bait behind   I think that you probably don't understand the road very well  though   forward progress involves letting go of fixed beliefs about who you are    Your brain dump is just chock full of identity claims    things like "    a person that values himself as thinking very logically "  That's an identity claim    it's a fixed idea about how you are supposed to be so that you'll recognize yourself   There's bait in that trap  the bait is certainty   "I know who I am" has a bait taste to it    a flavor that keeps you hanging around the dispenser  even though you're caged thereby    This is something to be shed on the road    that addiction to believing yourself to be some fixed "logical thinker"    It's not that logical thinking is bad  it's just that fixed beliefs about your self definition are things which diminish you   All of them   The unbounded possibilities of authentic being cannot be "boxed up" in such self limiting ideas   That kills off your wholeness  that kills off the unity of self    But it buys you a superficial certainty about who you are   The bait   I could go on  there's plenty of that kind of raw material in your post    But it's much better if you re read it through that lens and identify the "clinging to self" by your own inspection   Freedom has a price  the price is the loss of certainty    You won't know who you are in that same comforting and repetitive way    But you'll grow like a forest in rich soil I thought it'd be either suicide or hooker Well I'm kind of like you  Idk if your really shy and awkward like me but I pretty much don't spend all my time studying and like to go out  I love basketball and play 3 times a week but yeah I suck   I'm not that athletic or at all but try to be active as much as a I can  I just started lifting and I hope to get a better physique  IDK the problem with me is my quietness and my social skills  IDK if you go to parties or really sociable but I kind of consider myself like you someone that doesn't want to be too popular or a super nerd  I wish I had someone who was like me but I can't  IDK if I am a nerd but I try to consider myself a person with sense Ahh that's fair  Guess you will plan your evening a little better next time  I'm going to add something   You're   FAR   from the only person to have ever been in your situation  and there's a lot of work that's been done on the best course of action here  I'm speaking from experience  not personal  but from relatives and friends who had children at a very young age      Option A     If abortion is off the table  consider adoption  It really is the best option overall for the child  for you and your girlfriend  and for those around you  It can be a tough thing to do for the mother in particular  but a healthy infant is extremely likely to find a good home with thoroughly vetted parents that desperately want a child  Talk to your girlfriend's gynecologist   they can direct you to the right people to help with the process     Option B    If you are determined to keep the child  this is my advice  throw away your pride  and get all the help you can get      If you're in the US and you do not yet get food stamps EBT  apply   and then go back once the child is born  Talk to a social worker and see if there are any other benefits you qualify for  and accept anything you can get     Talk to your parents and her parents  and or any other relatives  Tell them you want to go to school training etc to make sure you have a good career in the future  and you need their help  Accept whatever they can give    If you can  move in with your parents or hers  Don't be in a rush to get your own place  Not paying  much  rent is a HUGE amount of money you don't have to earn    If you can  don't change your plans for education job training  If you don't have plans  now is the time to make them  Your child will have a better future if you have a good career  and aren't trying to raise a family on a minimum wage dead end job  It will be a rough few years   you will have little time for partying and road trips while in college  But you can push through a part time job and school  and still finish in 4 5 years  Consider community college for your first 2 years   it will give you less of a financial burden  and let you get your education started while your child is in his or her most demanding years   Basically  do all you can to not let the child change your future  It may seem like the "responsible" thing to do is "be a man"  go out and get a job  and hope for the best   but asking for help and then having a rough 2 3 years for the sake of a good stable future after that is well worth the investment   If you absolutely can't get help from your family  can't take care of things with a part time job while going to school  and have no other options   at least try to move away from fast food  Try to find a job as a plumber  welder  or other skilled trade  If you can apprentice under a skilled boss  you can make money comparable to most college degrees within 5 years  and potentially a lot more after you become a master yourself and have your own business  Plus  a lot of people eschew "blue collar" work like that as something not worth doing    meaning job opportunities are out there   Retail work is "easy" and "obvious"  But don't let it be your endgame   it is going to plunge you into a never ending  cycle of just barely getting by   leaving you little to no time to pursue a better carrier   Good luck Yep  got a scared dog on top of me  and an indifferent cat by my toes    It's getting really warm actually  now that I think about it  Hi there  I'm Jen  What kind of cats do you have  I slept all day and woke up at 11 pm  they were blasting Muzak all day  but what can I do  I'm the weird one who sleeps all day and stays up all night  Gotta suck it up and deal with it  It's 7 30 in the morning now and  very  quiet I spent it alone sitting here with you guys  I am so fucking pathetic and tonight just reminded me I'm going to be a 34 year old virgin this Summer  Girls find me ugly and creepy  I can't even make friends because I'm so pathetic  I hate my life and despite years of effort  was unable to improve it  Hey thanks for taking the time to write this  I am actually amazing at keeping my sugars where I want  My doctor wants me to be around 120 150 at all times and for every 10 good numbers I have a bad one  I'm very well balanced and eat well    These are my cats  http   imgur com PVNisrp   Orange guy is Henry Beans  calico is Amelia  after the pilot  and the black one is Nugget Dumpsterborn  first of his name  Yeah  that's his real name Pretty well actually  I made a few friends by approaching them as strangers in public places and striking up a conversation  Normies obviously won't respond well to this kind of interaction so it won't help you befriend that generic Stacey but you'll meet some cool people if you grit your teeth and bear the inevitable rejections Definitely take up science classes  Biology  Anatomy and Physiology  and Chemistry  See if you can take the AP level classes for those subjects   As for colleges  start looking into schools in your state with good nursing programs if you don't want to go out of state  The local community college by my house has a good nursing program and people usually transfer after doing two three years there could just fly there  no real need for a car in college anyways  He would be considered creepy well i just moved to italy because my dad got a job on an american military post  People don't adopt because they have to  but because they want to  Adoption could mean a better life for the child and the new parents Unfortunately  yes     I want to go to sleep  but it's kind of impossible right now  It's so loud and noisy because of the fireworks  Is there an early college program at your school  Try speaking to a counselor and start there  They can give you information about your options  If it were me  I would start taking classes at a community college  At my high school  there was an early college program for those at least 16 yrs of age  in which at the end of the two year program you'd have your GED or Diploma as well as an associates degree  Not only would it be saving you a bunch of money in the long run  but it would also prepare you for a more rigorous school experience if you decided to pursue medicine  Going along with that  your local community college may have a nursing program or something that sets you up in the medical field  I would try their nursing programs or whatever they recommend before ever looking into the for profit nursing schools    I'm 21 years old and only now decided what I want to study  Don't sweat it  especially since you're still in high school  Good luck    Ack  That doesn't sound too bad to be honest  At least you have a pet keeping you company  That's better than nothing  Probably not  despite the social interaction and pretty girls i think this experience has shown me that i do want to be alone forever which honestly im cool withOhhhhhhhh  Sorry  I'm not quite familiar with Italy's education curriculum  but I'm sure Biology  Anatomy  and Chemistry are all offered so I would start there at least Boy I wish I had something worthwhile to spend all my free time on  Maybe then I wouldn't feel so alone  It's a delicate situation  a wrong decision or indecision can cost you  That's   well it's the ugly side of life  But if you explain it and he reacts negatively  that's a good sign staying with him isn't worth the effort  right   I think  speaking as a guy  that if he's really interested in  you   he will be more than understanding and patient with you For what it's worth  you taught me the word "gaslight " so there's that   Well  atleast you're a  normal 21 year old   pffft   I'm really sorry  though  this is super shitty  I mean I never had the opportunity to get shit on like this  I was just ignored     always  I'll count myself lucky  damn I'm sorry OP  https   www reddit com r

like a successful night  Happy new year buddy hahaHope is the first step on the road to disappointment    On that note  congrats  Don't screw it up I don't know whether this is a recognized fallacy but you're making a common thinking error in assuming that the existence of something is evidence for its necessity  The fact that these books exist doesn't mean someone needs to read them to successfully navigate the dating world     Happy new yearFedora  neckbeard and a swarm of flies because of not showering is not enough amazon overnight it  I dont know  get it yourself then fly over there  not much you could do at this pointThat sounds like the type of person I'm going to grow up to be  The weird one who stays up all night and sleeps all through the day and has no real job  Then I'll probably complain because I couldn't and didn't get enough sleep  Yeah thats fine just be friendly  and remember your 18 and his daughter's 16  If this guy isn't a creep he'll see you as a kid in his eyes  Be friends with him but if he comes on you tell him straight up that the age gap is to much and you have kids  im not looking to be a mother figure or sister figure to these kids Personally  I wouldn't  There's no obvious reason for a 50 year old man to go out of his way to meet an 18 year old woman except  frankly  for pleasure   And he's a lawyer  it's his job to be persuasive and appear sincere   And evade direct answers to questions   And he has gone out of his way   This is not something that grew slowly   He is actively pushing things along   I feel it fair to say  as a 60 year old man  that he has an agenda     definitely meant more scary  thanksOh my god    That sounds horrible  I know this won't be much condolences to you  but happy birthday and happy new year  Hopefully  this year will be a better year  even if it started out shitty I have to go pick up my little brother from a party sometime soon  So I was told  Hope he calls me soon  I'm falling asleep  The only social media worth using is twitter  You can see news from most companies there   just don't follow real people  Aside from that I use Instagram to share what normies call 'artsy' photos with my family so they feel like they didn't raise a waste of space  Even if I do screw it up  now I know it's possible  and I've already learned a lot  pol  KappaIf it's an electric eggbeater you probably broke it  You can get another for like  20 on Amazon  Just use it for only eggs in the future   This was hilarious and heartbreaking  I think you need a tremendous amount of luck to "make it" as an author  but uh  maybe try just writing about your life experiences  Like a "Me Talk Pretty One Day" kind of thing  If you luck out and get some attention  people would probably be into it Congrats buddy  That being said   obviously martial arts is not close to the most efficient way to transform your body  I'm good with everything else hahathanks  same to you  We just broke 4000    quite sad tbhWhy didn't you just not drink so you could stay at the party I meant transforming physically and mentally   No other single physical activity does that as well as martial arts Happy New Year Yeah  I get what you mean  I feel like I'm wasting my life away  Maybe you can pick up some hobbies  Are you interested in anything in particular  I dont know but this has been the nail in the coffin for whether or not im deciding to be live alone forever because things always end up not working out or there are 50 solutions and im too stupid to see themHonestly I have the same problem with my cousin but much worse  He's jealous of me and makes my life litterally living hell  The best thing to do is to just accept whatever he's doing and just show him love  Because honestly in the grand scheme of things this really doesn't matter  He is your brother  He will be the only one with you once your parents pass away  He will always be there for you so just stick with him and tryYou didn't read the sticky thread  did you I wish I could fall asleep and fix my life  In fact  I should probably try to sleep  But anyway  I hope you guys have a happy new year    Hell  id drive Weight doesn't belong on this list Hey  thanks dude  It's kinda nice knowing that I'm not alone  even though I obviously wish that you didn't have all that  I appreciate your comment regardless   Either way  happy new year  man  may it be a good one  Why are those 2 things related  Some times a bunch of little issues build up and express themselves in one big way  You probably weren't that upset over the football game  Maybe other things have been getting to you  too  The straw that broke the camel's back   Also  hormones  At last    All the best  Don't come back Congrats  Where how did you meet her Interesting  So you now have lasting relationships with these people  or otherwise stemming from these interactions The hardest part isn't the exercising  It's the time sacrifice and diet change   Make sure you find a routine that isn't longer than 30 45 minutes  I was doing a 2 hour routine and it burned me out after 6 months Sounds to good to be real Which ever side you dont agree withI met her while camping lmao  She was actually at the campsite next to mineIt sucks spending new years alone  I feel yah  There's maybe a silver lining to this timing  it's a new year  time for new beginnings  I don't know the full story but I would say detach from him completely  don't message him  this is a new chance to re define yourself  yourself as something different  I seriously hope your 2017 is fucking awesome  I'm so sorry  I contracted HIV at the age of 20  and I have no idea how I would've managed if all of that had happened a year earlier  So props for working on rebuilding your life   it's a long  hard slog  but as you're finding out  it's eminently doable    First thing is to take care of your health and get on medications  If you haven't done this  get to a doctor or a sexual health clinic ASAP  Getting to an undetectable viral load will  with any luck  calm you down  You'll feel better  and just as important  it'll make it so much harder  maybe impossible  still an open question just how low the risk of transmission is for a person who is undetectable  to pass along the virus   As for everything else  you're not going to be able to live a satisfying life  with or without HIV  if you keep looking for others to validate your worth  Your worth does not change when you get HIV  just as it does not change when you get a cold  You have an infection  albeit an especially severe one  and you deserve it no more than anyone who gets the flu deserves a week on the toilet  You're not unworthy as a human being  With regards to dating  my initial thought is to tell you to slow down  work on yourself a little bit  then jump back in  Learn to appreciate yourself a bit  If you want to keep dating  you can try out dating sites that cater to people living with HIV  but you don't have to  I wouldn't disclose on the first date personally  the only rule is to not do anything that risks transmission until you disclose  This may mean playing the role of perfect gentleman the first few dates you go on  which is fine  Just remember that lots of people are in serodiscordant relationships and quite happy in them  Loads of resources exist to help you out  like  here  http   www aidsinfonet org fact sheets view 613 and  here  http   www healthline com health hiv aids transmission risks faqs serodiscordant couples Prevention3    Now  if I can pontificate for a little bit  don't you dare say the virus bars you from living a fulfilling life  There are about 37 million people living with HIV globally   am I supposed to actually believe none of them can lead a fulfilling life  Am I myself consigned to a life of misery  What about Magic Johnson or Edwin Cameron  BFD South African judge   They've done alright for themselves  Is your life going to move in a different direction than you thought it might  Undoubtedly  Does that direction have to be less fulfilling  Only if you allow it to be  But don't for a second tell me that my  or your  situation is hopeless  insinuate that I can't be happy  or imply that I can't do meaningful things  I live with HIV  I'm not a bloody vegetable   PM me if you want to talk  Why are you presenting that as a fact  It's pretty strange to use such definitive language when describing things that can not be proven  That's what I've been telling myself for a long time now   I'm still waiting for the let down  but that's dangerous to do  because subconsciously you're undermining yourself and your relationship by thinking like that Probably  I think I will wait for his birthday instead  Thanks Dude  David Sedaris is like my number one favorite author  I would love to do a similar thing  with humorous anecdotes from my life    You are right though  "Tremendous amount of luck " And I mean I don't think I've demonstrated that I have that    I'm glad you enjoyed it though  I mean ultimately  what would make me feel best about all my rejection is if I could spin it into some comedy and cheer other people up  so again  it was really nice to know that you thought it was hilarious   Happy new year Part of me wants to pick up an instrument and expand my knowledge taste in music  I was considering asking to join my school's band and go from there but I feel no drive or motivation to improve or do anything  I don't feel depressed or get suicidal thoughts but it's a terrible feeling and I want eliminate it in 2017  How about you  Are you interested in any particular hobbies  Is there something that has always interested you but you've never actually tried it  Overheard my divorced neighbor lady today talking about last year's NYE  She was fed up with poverty and shit and couldn't wait to get hammered at midnight  then she proceeded to vomit all over the Christmas tree  Happy New Year Of course it can't be proven  But this is how I went from being lonely all the time to having confidence in my words and actions   These are my ideas and my opinions  and I can only hope that someone here can use even one little part of it I've relocated and we're no longer in contact but yes  the friendships that came of those approaches were just like the friendships which stemmed from meeting people at school or university or a workplace Ah  cheers  Enjoy your new word lol     Well  atleast you're a normal 21 year old  pffft   Yeah  Total relief that  Thank god everyone in my age group is depressed and riddled with anxiety to the point that they have trouble functioning   Anyways  yeah  thanks man  I appreciate the comment  Have a great new year GOOD FOR YOU FRIEND  I HOPE NOTHING BUT THE BEST FOR YOU AND YOU HAVE MY LOVE AND SUPPORT  EDIT  capsOh I'm consciously undermining myself   You're story seems so alien to me I'm a having trouble accepting any part of it as true  What do you mean by fake exactly    What exactly is "normie stuff" anyway    The usual  school work  social hobbies activities  drinking  going out with friends  showers  And with those experiences and age they become less inhibited and their social skills develop  hence  late bloomers   I wouldn't consider someone who escapes FA at 25  to merely be a late bloomer     And so what if one of them "got lucky" and met someone they were compatible with by   pure chance     Just answered your own question  They can't replicate pure chance     what do they have to do or prove to you for you to approve of their success   3  sexual partners or 1  if they choose to settle down right away  but are able to get more interested if they choose to  Basically they have to show that they can replicate their success and it wasn't just a fluke   Not saying their 1 2 success's are meaningless to them but they don't hold much weight when seeking their advice  Just like you'd rather ask a self made millionaire business owner rather than a millionaire lotto winner how to make money What a way to start the year  Happy new year to you as well mate     have a good one  "be yourself"   but here's a list of things you need to do and how to dress and act  yeah  okI can't blame you for that   If you would have asked me anytime during the last 15 years if this could ever possibly happen to me  I would have laughed and gone home and cried myself to sleep   I still tell myself she took pity on me  or I've been misreading this whole relationship and she's actually using me to get at my brother or something   It's difficult to accept  and I don't think I'm fully there yet Are your shoes loose  If your feet slide around a little  that's a point of friction and the whole forms  Try to tighten your laces or try an insertaww I really love all cats  I got mine from the shelter ones a small black and white named chimney and the other is a smokey  black  polydactyl  tiger ish boy named gremlinYes     Change them immediately  Happened to me as well  Someone took my keys then stole my car  Get your locks changed  Did you know the person or was it just some randomer  Is if possible it was a person you'd met before and just not remembered them I have my doubts  However if this is true best of luck to you  you guys are generalizing girls Not all girl go for looks Its about how you present yourself Example How you dress Confidence not to the point you become cocky  funny and this list can go on    You should put a disclaimer that this only applies to retards  Scared for a month  You are horribly  horribly retarded  Thanks Same to youYesIm a guy and I identify  with this so much but it must be even harder  as a girl since you're supposed to be the emotionally intelligent sexWell Happy New Year  for what it's worth coming from a rando on the Internet  I hope you got those calls DudeSo if you're able to make friends and you actually have friends   what makes you FA in the first place Right  right  Still retarded  My girlfriend has an IUD   400 for 5 years  Or birth control pills  Or condoms  Figure it out if you really think so  then break up with your gf and stop having sexThis is not about facts  This is just from my own perspective of what I have read  So it is not true nor is it false  Either I missed your story or you did not post it    And lets be honest here  If the post is filled with platitudes and "If I did it you can do it too" bs  Those people never really were FA otherwise that shit would't be even written in the post My two daughters were sick constantly  One was almost held back due to having colds and the such    BOTH had their Tonsils taken out on the same day     Neither have been sick much since then  their mother and I regret nothing  antarctica   i hear land is suuuuper cheap down there Wow  that was hard to read  I'm sorry all of this happened to you   I'd hate to break it to you but shit like this still happens when you get older  I'm 29 and I lose friends for no reason all the time  They just stop hanging out one day and when you know it  it's been years since you heard from them again   One of these was my first and best friend I made when I first moved to where I am today  we were inseparable for years  and now  we don't even talk to eachother   All you can do is move on and find better friends  46 years old and never had a New Year's kiss this is a great expression of your feelings but without some substance here idk how you expect us to help youHey buddy  I've been where you are  It gets easier  You both fucked up  in ways neither of you probably understand  and won't for a long time  Try to live your life  enjoy your hobbies  maybe get some new ones  It gets easier She won't do either  Period  She needs to give her head a shake yes sir  that's generally how small claims are sorted upon the necessary task of removing shit from peoplewot jpgNope These are things I did  and they worked for me You need to find what works for you If your partner isn't willing to work with you or if you can't trust them  why are you even with them I appreciate that  I posted in this sub to voice my raw frustration than to get answers  I expect nothing at all really  This is my equivalent of screaming in the middle of a mall food court or something  A letter to no one You should definitely do that  I think you should try to join the school band  Maybe joining it is the first step  Any instrument in particular you want to learn    Oh  I see  How long have you had those sort of feelings  Anyways  best of luck  Hopefully  you do overcome it  Let's hope 2017 is the year for all of us   I have a lot of things that I am interested in  but I have difficulty actually doing it because I'm all over the place and easily unmotivated  But as of late  Judo   I don't have any offline friends currently  Poverty has completely fucked my ability to meet and relate to people I was joking  Normie like to think their success is the result of hard work  However when they are pressed for details of what they actually did they won't or can't explain it  That attitude is not going to help brochacho this is an incredible blessing  despite not having the NEED to work   you need to treat your life as a responsibility or else you will be miserable   find something that you love and work hard at it  lazy is universally hated I never said it has nothing to do with looks  But if you're acting the way you are  you're just shooting yourself in the foot   The overwhelming majority of guys who are misogynists don't get girls  only the very  very attractive ones and it's solely because they're attractive  Don't use a small amount of shitty people to justify you being shitty  Good ol humblebrag  Even on NYE lmao Why not  Sounds like you know how to do it Disclaimer  Fish Oil shown to be useless in cardiovascular health specifically  Study not broad enough to declare fish oil outright useless I know that feeling I'm guessing an FAer didn't need everything to be perfect to be in a relationship with someone haha  I'm going to be honest here  it might be a little harsh but I went through a very similar situation and this is my experience   Your parents should 100  get a divorce  Your experience with your parents sounds exactly like mine and my parents stayed together anyway to make sure I had a family growing up  The toxic and constantly stressful conditions I grew up in were absolutely not worth it  What I'm trying to say here is that when two people know they shouldn't be together  no matter what the underlying circumstances  there shouldn't be a justification for them to stay together   Your parents involving you like they are is also a monumental failure on their part  You should have next to no involvement in the arguments  logistics  they should not be talking behind each other's back to you  and they should not be asking you to relay messages or make decisions for them   Time will heal these wounds and you will know it was a good choice  especially if they can have a healthy relationship after the smoke clears   As far as financial support  you should try to get on your feet as fast as possible  Even if you "decide" for them to not divorce  it won't change the built up tension  which will continue to get worse  and if it snaps and they do it anyway  you'll need a backup plan for sure   Good luck  my friend Same  brother  sameMy boyfriend was 19 when I met him as well  Been together 3 years now  I was his first kiss and everything  Hope to be like you guys   And congrats on a long relationship    hard to move on isn't it though  they are all wishing me happy new year  but I'm not sure if they really mean it thoughThis is not your decison to make  And shame on your parents for putting that onto you   You need to tell your parents to be adults and make the decison themselves  Or is not yoir marriage  It is there's  I "be myself" by playing video games and watching anime in my room all day  no gf yet   And inb4 you tell me why this doesn't work  if I have to take up hobbies that I hate and act like how I wouldn't  then I wouldn't exactly "be myself "Pick something for this moment I don't drink for the sake of not liking the feeling so completely understand   I also don't drink at all anymore because I want control of things and I'm 22 male who use to drink all the time I saw some polydactyl cats once down in Key West at Hemingway's house  They are so cool looking    I adopted the two kittens this year and are getting them used to being cuddled I'm financially crippled so there's not a lot of activities I can engage in  Anything beyond walking distance is too far and anything that isn't free is prohibitively expensive Sorry  I misunderstood  It is 7 am so did't really see the  normie I would look for one in CanadaIdk everyone seems to try to live to conform to others  I feel like I one is like me  How come Dude calm your shit  It was 5 years ago  You need to move on with your life and forget about it  Stop holding a grudge because you lost a fight  It happens    Move on Thats truly horrible  I clicked on your post because I hate coming home for break too  hopefully its the last time  since I graduate soon   but your post makes my time here seem like a breeze  I know you didn't ask for advice  but try to support your brother as much as possible  You both are in this together  Keep going to therapy too  and keep your head up  You'll be back at school soon  Ideas are a dime a dozen  Execution is everything   Legally you don't owe him anything  but in addition to the emotional fair aspect of keeping him compensated  there is a term of art in business called the nuisance factor    If your idea becomes successful and you totally snub your friend  there is a good chance of getting sued    Look at how many nuisance suits Zuckerberg had to deal with at FB    The better way is to cut him in now and in doing so force him to sign a legal release absolving you of any liability to him for taking your idea   The best way to compensate your friend is with stock options rather than straight equity   5  is probably attractive from your perspective  and 10 15  would be a more generous "finders fee "   You could also throw him a board seat if you appreciate his vision and advice     If you are serious  a lawyer could help you form an LLC and get the capital structure in place    But for now you could just sign a 1 sentence agreement with him that says you will do those things once and if you get more traction with the idea  that is  once you get the app close to developed and get a little seed capital  Probably not a router problem  It's most likely your service is just shit either because your provider is boning you or your bandwidth is being chewed up by other people watching Netflix payola for their contributorsSome people do  some people don't  Maybe teens do more than most  I guess the older you are  the less you care if people judge you for being yourself Why it doesn't  I think it does  A good number of people probably overeat and don't exercise enough but I'm sure there are some people who have legitimate medical problems that caused weight issues Lol it's hard as fuck to become hercules esque so I doubt it's a issue getting abs however is hard but doableIf you are working maybe you could move to a shared flat  you don't have to stay with your parents   Also  you could look for a counsellor therapist   or at least someone you can trust   and start talking about what is worrying you  You really don't have anyone Don't kick him out  What he did is awful and cannot be excused  but he flew to spend 3 months with you so you at least mean something to him  I normally would say talk it out but   3rd time   that's not working obviously  I don't know what kind of person he is but be better than him and simply tell him he has to find somewhere to go or fly back asap  They say once a cheater  always a cheater  But hey  who knows  Either way  you don't have to deal with this  It's hard enough being in a long distance relationship and with the absence of trust and loyalty  this isn't going anywhere  Good luck to you I'm gonna take a shot in the dark and day you're maybe 14  You're severely overreacting  Maybe just unblock them and relax  Act like nothing happened  and it'll never get brought up again I was in the middle school band but didn't care enough to join high school band because the high school band seemed up be one big joke  I might go for the baritone    I've been feeling this way since may of last year  I'm just confused and I feel like I'm facing a midlife crisis and I don't think I'm even at the halfway mark  s let's make 2017 our year  I see people complain about 2016 and I feel like we often forget that what we should change is how we act  That's what makes a difference  not the year      Let's stay committed and motivated in 2017  But don't depend too much on motivation  Motivation is more of a feeling and it can go away  Instead lets go for good habits and stuff  Then to be fair you weren't that socially awkward  If a guy who doesn't know you at all decides to talk to you it's understandable that you were short with him What medical problems  That is not true  I'm positive weight doesn't belong on this list  It's a lot of effort for the rest your life  It sucks but get used to it it's very important Bingo  You'll be fine  Learned a lesson in muting your mic when you're not using it lolYeah Im a teen  It sucks  I mean I wish I was at a couple of parties and had friends but no one relates to me I guess  I mean i love basketball and sports but like everyone just wants to do that stupid snapchat bs and I just can't talk to anyone It was within weeks he started improving  It has been a year now and the difference is mind boggling  Steady improvement all year  damn that's great man  my 20th bday is next week and so far no luck   your post gives me hope tho  do you have any advice  was this girl like a good friend of yours or someone you met recently So what did you do for the remaining 29 minutes and 30 seconds   Just kidding m8  Congratz  D I hope this is the start of a fantastic 2017 for you No   When visiting a couple always sit in between them  preferably on a couch made for 2 Since when does playing sports not help you find friends  The times have changed I'm in your boat buddy  I'm two years into my CS degree and the only reason why I took this route is because I'm good at it and I don't want a labor job  been there done that     My current strategy is to just keep working through college and hopefully I'll stumble on something that I actually would see myself doing every week for a few years  We're not the only ones either  apparently a lot of people have this problem  Worst case scenario we finish school and still have no motivation  but what we do have is that fancy piece of paper that should make us more money than a fresh hs graduate I love the caps  Thank you so much You don't have to be lonely at herpes only dot comHaha yeah  More of a lesson in not taking things too seriously tho Throughout life you'll learn that people can be pretty shitty  Sucks you had to learn early  If you still care to be friends with these people  you could try to sit down and ask them  maybe one on one  whats going on  Otherwise  just move on with your life  Maybe try for a fresh start when you go to high school  if you can    Chin up though  you have a bunch more New Years Eve's to enjoy with great people you'll meet in life  Happy New Year Wat do you mean  You acknowledge people don't play sports that much anymore  I think my biggest fear is a ways down the line when the hurt has worn off and tempers cool  I've seen similar family drama boil down  simmer and then suddenly the person who made the change for the better gets blamed for the leftover rift  I don't want my husband to resent me one day because it's been made very clear to me that I will be the one to sever our ties     But that's more my paranoia than something he has made me believe will happen  I know this anecdotal experience doesn't mean that's what's going to happen  for one my husband seems even more upset than I am  just not very good with words and knows he probably wouldn't handle it right  but I suppose in the end part of me also wants to take what I see as the highroad  Some good advice here has me giving them a couple months to get jobs  but when I think about the lease only being about 6 more months and a good  solid  final point I feel like if I give them at least that much more time  a bit of a final warning  I can truly say that I gave them all the time they could need without glaring them down  At this point I don't even consider it being a martyr because I'm not doing it to be altruistic  Instead of lighting a fire under them where they scrape by and make it over the finish line  meeting some measly deadline that should have been a year ago  there's instead a brick wall they will suddenly come up against where they will turn around  look back  and see that they did not do everything they could have  or at the very least the sprawling unfairness  and I can say goodbye  I'm not exactly rooting for them to fail  but at this point I would find it all too convenient if they suddenly get to work  That's not a good precedent for down the line  none of what has happened is a good precedent even months ago  and I'm not stupid anymore  I'm sad about the situation and various other things  but there is an end in sight at the least Maybe you could focus on yourself instead of comparing with others all the time  because that's the only thing you really have control over And the military really is a good option   if  he marries this girl  If he doesn't  he can't consider her a dependent and it's unrealistic that he'd win custody in court over the baby  which would need a care taker when he goes on deployment anyways   But if he did  the pregnancy  birth  and healthcare while serving would all be covered and they'd pay him extra for having family    However  the military will only work if you marry the girl you got pregnant with  or else it's a crap shoot and will only make life more difficult  It's very unlikely that you two will stay together anyways  and the service breaks people  Like  I've never seen more depressed people like I did while deployed on a ship  It breaks hearts  marriages  and people's sanity  The struggle  is  real  It's no fucking joke  Don't consider it an easy out    I was saying I'm surprised you play sports and can't find friends  Most of my closest friends were made this way Cease contact  do not go to lunch  absolutely do not humor him anymore  If he shows up to your work make sure you let someone know  Let the police know if you have to  If he starts harassing you definitely let the police know  Not trying to scare you  it's just better to be safe than sorry I don't know girls I talk to tell me I'm funny  kind  have great personality and like talking to me but they never want to be my girlfriend I think my looks is the biggest deal breaker maybe I'm just talking to the wrong girls    I'm not one to usually say just walk away but this is a sketchy situation  She's playing games and being manipulative  these tendencies will only get worse as the relationship progresses  Stop visiting subs that condone sexslavery and rape then lolFriends  family  and our health care system  What you should do is schedule an appointment with a therapist once the holiday is over   While it's normal to feel lonely at times  it's a little alarming to shift the blame on everyone  and humanity as a whole  to blame social media  to want to throttle anyone you see outside  to see everything as disgusting and decayed   and to cope with all of this with alcohol   It sounds like you have some form of anxiety at the least  perhaps something else more complicated  and a therapist  can help you identify and remediate  even if there is no underlying issue  Seeing a therapist is not shameful  no more so than seeing a doctor for a physical problem  Right on manMy standards are pretty much not obese  overweight is fine pretty much everything is fine not that it mattersYour advice is very sound and thought out  There's a lot I will be plucking from this and some that my husband and I have already thought about  Particularly the bit at the end  scheduling time away following our breakup  That's definitely something we should consider  At any rate  we do have an end in sight  We definitely aren't legally obligated to them and we don't owe them anything Even if he's not religious or part of their personal community  that's what they  should  be there for  So hopefully only advice ive ever gotten is to suck it up until you get used to it  i can work a 60 hour week on my feet no problem  but it takes a bit to get used to it if its not consistent or you've been off your feet for a while  I knew a chef once who I had seen work 100 hour work weeks on his feet when we were short on staff  great man too its just too bad people start to lose their sanity after that much work  Every so often ill do a stretch at work to loosen up and it seems to help  GoodluckThis is actually quite sweet  I wish he could read this  That would probably be all he needs  Why not plan for a 4 0 and bust your butt to get it  You can do it   it makes everyone and everything on earth suffer and feel scared   Few years   Shit   something like that is happening in 3 weeks  https   en wikipedia org wiki United States presidential inauguration  TBH  I didn't read the whole thing  But I can tell you that that want to get divorced and want your blessing  They wouldn't ask you unless they wanted clear conscioses   Tell them to go ahead with the divorce  You'll all be happier  No  I really hope nothing like that happens in my life time  Sorry   hahaI mean there is one relatively easy way but yeah it's not supossed to be easy since suicide is rarely the right call even though it may seem thst way Happy for you budI'm glad everything got straightened out  I know you wish you could drop weight quicker  but that's not what it's about  It's about commitment and lifestyle change  I hope you can stick with it  someday all the guys will wish they were with you I would sincerely like to call you a douche nozzle with kindest regards for suggesting an abortion    Nah but forreal  put it up for adoption  she'll have a lot more mental psychological issues breakdowns with an abortionTake some time now to practice on the highway  You could even go out with your dad on the highway s few times  as well  You could always look for a ride share for someone else to drive  or for companionship  who is going back to Texas for school just as you are    If you stick to about 8 10 hours of driving and maybe 400 500 miles a day it will be a reasonable trip  I've done it in all sorts of weather  If you belong to AAA you can a free trip pack that will break down the routes with note about construction or go with a good GPS    In general  breakfast is the best meal of the day on the road because it is the cheapest and you get the most for your money  Have your car and tires checked out so you won't have any mechanical problems along the way    You can do this but it will cost you  all estimates for 4 days  gas   120   motels   350  and food   100   I am assuming that you stay at standard good motels and eat at least two good meals a day  With other expenses it may cost about  600 total for the whole trip    You definitely want a car in Texas   Edit  Last line Everything we do is based on fear anyway  It is way more subtle but still is there  This is true  There are sketchy invalid tests sometimes  but a clear positive is always positive   Waiting for final results might just mean waiting for confirmation via bloodwork  which actually has more to do with confirming the hCG levels are high enough to be a healthy pregnancy  My doctors office doesn't even offer confirmation bloodwork unless requested  a bfp home test is proof enough   That being said  even if the pregnancy isn't viable  which this early is still a possibility   parents should still be involved like    now Well  try to think from their perspective  Why would they invite you  Why should they invite you  Answer these questions and you'll answer your own    Problems might seem random and with no obvious solution  but it's only until you really look into the problem that you begin to notice some things  I read your post and it seemed okay until the "It's as if everyone thinks I'm part of someone else's group  so in the end I'm part of no ones" part  That's the part that raised a red flag  Your assumption is that the reason you aren't invited anywhere is because people just think you're part of someone else's group  but I can tell you that's not how it works  It might apply to attractive people as you know  but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you're average looking  so that this post will probably maybe resonate with you    The case is probably that you aren't a memorable person  So you don't stick out in people's mind enough to make them think  "hmmm I want him at my party " Well why don't you stick out  Are you a boring person  Could you honestly say that you stand out from the crowd  and that others would agree with that  Keep in mind that you don't have to be VIP special for someone to invite you  it's that you have to stand out of the crowd just enough to be noticed  If you don't  then how exactly will they differentiate you from the others kids in class    If you aren't making an effort to connect with people beyond a "hey" sort of acquaintance  don't expect them to make the effort to send you an invite I don't know  It doesn't really matter though  There's no reason for a guy his age to want to "befriend" you  especially the way he did  From what you described either he's crazy or he wants something sexual  Either way there should be no reason for you to take this any further  and if he starts pressing that's immediately a bad sign and you'll want to start taking countermeasures  That's just an If though  He'll hopefully just leave you alone and that'll be the end of it I mean I don't really play  I was Never on a team just played pickup a few years ago  I also just started going to the gym and joined he frisbee clubI don't think he'll be enough to start something world changing  Who knows tho  I don't know politicswell atleast you have good morals stillI don't have any friends to whose weddings I could even go  so your situation could worse It depends upon your field and your job prospects  You have to judge that for yourself because there may be many more opportunities in the US  despite the draw of your homeland  I mean pre internet dating was all about your networks       Who do you go to school with    Who are your neighbors    Who are your friends  and in turn who are their friends    Who do you work with     Anyone you dated was usually someone that has some form of connection to you whether it is geographical  family  friend  etc     Because of that  your dating pool was much more limited so people were much more willing to "settle" because you really don't know who else is out there     Nowadays people have so much choice so people are much less willing to settle  So many people think "the one" is out there and they're willing to hold out for them  I didn't read all of that  I'll admit  I got broken up with 3 4 months ago  and its still really hard  But lord  I wish I had someone as afraid to lose me as you were of losing her  Thanks for the feedback  In the future  consider saying "I'd like to take you out"Do you know why your Dad doesn't want you to get one   I would start the conversation with that   And honestly  if you are looking to go to higher ed  it is probably a worthwhile trade off to wait a few years for the tattoo  because college is a serious financial commitment  assuming that you are in the US   It's possible that your Dad's motivation may be narcissistic and a want for control   But it is also quite possible that he is considering things that might not occur to you   At 16  you still have a few years for growing   if you get a tattoo now  your changing body shape might stretch your skin and distort it in ways that aren't flattering   Are you going to be paying for the tattoo yourself   Good work can be pricey  and when you are older  and likely have a little bit more disposable income you can do more research and pick a great artist without having to worry as much about the cost   Upkeep   if you participate in any extracurricular activities  keeping it covered and properly cared for during the healing process might not be workable   And finally  I know that teenagers hate to hear it  but a lot of things that sound like a great idea when you are a teenager do not seem like a great idea to you just a few years later   it doesn't always feel like it  but the judgement part of your brain is still doing a lot of maturing now and for a few more years   If I had gotten a tattoo when I was 16  I would say that there would be at least a 75  chance that I wouldn't be happy with it now Im so sorry you experienced this  The shit that you have gone through is just shocking and I honestly feel for you  I agree with what the other Redditor said about how difficult it is to make it as a writer  but I also think its not necessarily impossible  Maybe you can just write as a hobby  Also  I think that you should write about your life experiences    "Things I liked  the length  1 100 words   Things I didn't like  the plot  characters  style  voice  dialogue  and themes  If Im correct  1  100 words is around 2 3 pages  Was it a short story or just a few pages into the piece that you were working on  If you dont mind  I can critique your work honestly and try to provide constructive criticism    Anyways  happy New Year and hopefully  it is a better year I would definitely move to the US  i think a change is always nice and its not like theyre tryina put you in the middle of nowhere like kansas or something so yeah id say do itSounds like you're on a good path man Yea but no one is aware of it  I want people everyone to be so scared to the point where even the closest of friends start screwing each other over in order to get higher groundIt sucks but he is your legal guardian and you're a minor therefore what he says goes  I'm in love with tats  Currently planning out my full sleeve  money and time  with the artist  However  him threatening to not pay for your college is shit  College is a struggle as it is and loans suck  However  college isn't his responsibility either  You're fully capable of going to school and paying for it yourself  I don't think he'd legitimately not pay for your schooling if he planned on doing so if you got a tattoo but I do think he's right in making  wanting to make  you wait  Did you like band in middle school  Did you play baritone in high school  Why did you think it was like a big joke  That's awesome  you should definitely go for it  Maybe the high school band is actually better than you think it is  Btw  tell me how it goes  when and if  you join    Oh wow  so quite a while  Have you told anyone about it  like your family   Haha  so fake it until you make it  But yes  we should  2017 should be our year  Thanks for the advice  I'm gonna take it to heart  I kind of feel better about the new year   Anyways  good night  The fireworks have finally stopped  thankfully   So  I'm gonna go to sleep now  See a doctor  Anti depressants can really work for some people  It's taken me trying 7 different ones over the past 10 years but I think it's worth it  Yea I hate how people are born rich and with good genetics while others are cursed with a disability they couldn't avoid and live a poor life  I want everyone to suffer together and see what it feels likeIt's a lose lose situation anyway you look at it    No for self promotion I'd like to think so but love isn't enough and let's face it most of us here are broken in some way and don't see a "fix" coming anytime soon    Either we don't have energy for change or just mental issues or something we can't change in rare circumstances  all I know we are alone in this world and suffering for it  We have a physical and mental need for companionship and if we don't find something to fill this void what do we have   I hope you guys are able to find help from a therapist or something because this is at eating us from the inside and every day a part of us is lost   it dies and as time passes there is less and less to recover  So I hope you can find something to fill this void even if it is just partially so you can put it in the back of your mind and have a fullfilling life and maybe find love one day unexpectedly What'd u do  Make concrete I went through something similar  It sucks  But    Its not the kid's choices  We have no place and no say in our parents' marriages  Recognizing and accepting that is a step towards adulthood    Edit  wrong pronounI was brought up with Islam but don't believe anymore  Those who believe in the religion will always pull the context card and try to justify the filth in the Quran using history or hadith or sunnah  Bottom line is that the Quran says many times that it does not need any of these to be understood  Therefore  the book is meant to be taken as is  You sister must have gone to college to be an officer    If you join any service  such as the Air Force  it will only be for 4 years and you can take tests and choose a career field that may give you a real foundation for the rest of your life  Being stationed anywhere in the world is a crap shoot but there are real opportunities for travel and adventure so that's the luck of the draw    It's okay to make mistakes and try out new things because you can always make changes and moves that will enrich your life  If you don't make choices they others will make them for you Mostly because I can use plant based ones in salads and foods as a flavour enhancer   Also  CBC marketplace in Canada did a show on fish oils   They ran several lab tests and found most fish oils to be rancid by the time we even get them   Once they are rancid they can actually be toxic   I can get Hemp seed oil locally lroduced as I live in the prairies I think that may be the real problem  we can't get passed our looks for ourselves in the first place Thank you for your bluntness      Elsewhere here I mentioned that I'm hoping for the end of our lease to be our cutoff point for somewhat selfish reasons  Of course it won't be the day the lease is up that they find out we're not happy  I'm sure they already know on some level  but we will give them warning   At this point I don't feel like I want to salvage the situation because they have proved to be more than a little inept at adult ing  If they get jobs and contribute at some point in the next couple months  great  especially because that would mean they might be more amenable to moving out on their own  but at this point I cannot see myself living with them any longer I don't recommend drugs for this  no    I do have experience with LSD  it's been a long time  and I don't think it's necessary for self understanding    I was a Zen student  so I like mindfulness practice as a growth tool   A more thorough take on my view can be found here  https   antiblog quora com The structure of transformation srid C3lYCongrats mah dude  enjoy this feeling of happiness for the rest of your days Sorry you're gonna have to get better internetYa  it's not fair buddy  I completely agree with everything you said  I was born rich with good genetics  It's also not fair how you want people like me to suffer for things we couldn't avoid either Thank you for sharing this  I'm much younger than you and I now feel a sense of hope for myself   For awhile I've had friends hooking up and even losing their virginity at a young age while I'm here geeking over games and computer stuff   Thank you again and congrats   I agree with those here who advise caution  HonestlyKidding's post seems to be on the mark  You should follow Mcdok's advice and cease contact because no good can come of it and he had way too much experience to be texting an 18 year old woman with the line he's given you Current research does not portray saturated fats as harmful   and show they increase total cholesterol by increased levels of HDL cholesterol  Furthermore dietary cholesterol does not effect serum levels   Aside from algae  there are no other sources of DHA or  EPA     I do not believe a person is capable of eating enough algae to get adequate amounts without using some form of concentrate     Plant based is such a vague nonsense term    Is beef plant based  as cows are vegans   Print one on your computer I haven't been diagnosed with depression yet depression because I haven't gone to the doctor yet  I don't know how am I going to explain this to my parents  I just know I have struggle with suicidal thoughts for as long as I could remember but never attempted  I thought they were normal  Also I've been isolating myself more and more for almost a year now so I get really nervous and anxious when I see my friends again  I don't even know if it's depression  I don't want to self diagnose myself  That may be true  The post makes a point though  We mourn and honor those who die in the accomplishment of the mission  but once the mission is over we forget about those that lived through it   Lost friends  Broken homes  Broken minds  Financial struggles  The occasional taboo of being a former service member and the struggles that brings from finding jobs to social life    Edit  Thats why you see a lot of vets looking after other vets  How old are you first it would helpExcept it's not just you or other people born to succeed  it'll be everyone that suffers  Only way things will be fair  and people will finally feel what the less fortunate have felt all their lives I am hoping to be happily suprised   but I doubt it and if god is real why is there so much disease starvation etc  Why hasn't he shown himself if he wants us to follow him  Are we expected to follow an invisible entity without any proof other than hearsay  No I  Expect there's something awaiting us alright  a void  an abyss pure nothingness swallowing us up and going to a dreamless sleep eternally So true  I was in five years  It's not an easy out but the benefits are good  At the very least his kids healthcare would be covers if they did joint custody  Which it sounds like there's no trouble in paradise  It's just general stuff  Trying to talk to people more often and become someone who is fun to be around  Like  I'm an introvert but learned how to stop using that as an excuse  I used to be pretty quiet which is okay  but you have a lot more fun if you actually  do  something I'm suspicious that my mom wants to divorce  but she's worried that I would be hurt by it  How do I tell her that I support her if she wants to leave him but stay in my place and not try to play marriage counselor Lolhttp   www cancer org cancer news omega 3 fatty acids linked to increase in prostate cancer riskThis is the first thing I thought of  too  Your shoes are too big I wouldn't say anything specific  Just trying to be more talkative with my co workers and take interest in their thoughts and feelings  It absolutely wasn't something that instantly became part of me   took a year and a half to get to where I am now  Step by stepHave you let it cool down completely   If not  unplug it  let it cool for several hours  and try again   But if that doesn't work  then it's probably dead    people like that are scumbags but yeah pretty solid advice I guessI'm agreeing with you o oHow is your resume and what are you applying to New year new you  put that all behind you   HAPPY  lolSame  I did five years as a HM  Saw so many pregnant women with deployed boot husbands and shit sometimes worked out but there was so much stress placed on both parties  I just don't want the OP to think all issues will be solved because recruiters love to play this scenario up  they know they can snag people in with situations like this  OP won't have anything to barter with because his options are so limited on what else he can do  Weed helps but the damage has already been done  I try to write a poem every day on my blog as self therapy as well   http   the54thdeadline com Right  You are targeting me haha  Fuck man  I have everything I could ever want in life  but I also had a stroke that kills most people that have it  I have some nice issues because of it  Everyone knows what it's like to suffer I'm going almost through the same thing right now with my parents showing signs of needing divorce  and I wish they asked me what your parents asked you  because I would 100  say yes  From what I've seen of some of my friends' parents  if you can't live with your spouse  and you divorce  everyone gets happier  There may be bad blood or a little legal trouble in the beginning  but it is not damaging in and of itself  For your situation  I can see where trouble may lie  but only you know whether or not the risks you listed are worth your parents' freedom from one another So why are you going after randoms on Tinder if you're so worried about this  Your logic doesn't make a ton of sense Why do you feel this way  If you need an ear  I am here for you pal  I take Klonopin for anxiety and ketamine for depression  I haven't noticed any side effects beyond mild drowsiness from the Klonopin  and no side effects from the ketamine Yo I'm like tipsy right now from NYE but can try to give tips  Friends went to bed  party was at my house  so I decided to get on Reddit before bed since I usually stay up late thanks to work lol  Unfortunately idfk how to explain this in a way that makes it easy  But it just happens over time when you take yourself out of your comfort zone  One thing that helps is to force it on yourself by joining a club organization or getting a job or something similar  Before joining choir in high school I just came home and played Minecraft or Runescape all day all weekend  By the end of high school I eventually had friends and even a prom date due to choir  If you just put yourself out there it will be a decent experience even if it's awkward to begin with Good advice In the USA  arm's length Thank you for this  It may sound like 'just a cliché'  but it was the encouragement that I needed to hear  We spent part of our night out at her friend's house for New Years  In just a casual night out  we got to talking more again  On our way there  it was mostly silent  but on our way home  there was hardly a break in conversation  I guess I forgot how great of a team we really were  We got home  ate  and fell asleep to Criminal Minds on the couch together rather than her or I just jumping on a game  I think we really needed a night out as we haven't been out together for quite a while  Waking up to read your message has helped inspire and strengthen what I was starting back towards in my heart  Again  thank you so much for such a heartfelt response  This has to be a troll post  right  I guess that post that made it from the front page brought a lot of new people in My personality is a completely rotten turd by this point  joke's on thembro it's not just you  what about all the good looking college guys and girls who just party all the time  make love  and don't need to worry about anything because of rich ass parents  They live life on easy mode  their struggles is not getting 100 likes on an instagram post  fuck themThanks  man because  as cliche as it sounds  the closest thing to an "answer" is Be yourself because at the end of the day people will like you for you It's time to get a real therapist and get to the bottom of this  Do it now while you're young Hug bro  Talk about interest  Music  hobbies  books  Don't talk about family  work  politics  religion Damn dude   it was rough before the birthday plot twist   It takes years to appreciate somebody's great personality   This is a really great point that a lot of people seem to miss   Have my upvote Do you have any idea how stupid you sound  Have you ever had an original thought in your life I was in the same boat as you  I graduated high school with a 1 9 gpa but after hard work and determination I cruised through undergrad and now i'm in a masters program with a 3 5 gpa  Don't settle for anything less than the best  Set your goal to be a 4 0 and work your ass off to get as close as you can  Nothing beats hard work  Believe in yourself Congrats  Now go and never look back   They probably do mean it  Maybe they're not as close as they once were  but that's no reason to believe they're being intentionally deceitful or mean spirited    They're probably not "betraying" you or anything so intentional  They're just growing away from you a bit  and it's okay if you grow away from them too  Maybe someday you'll all grow closer    I'm sorry that your evening sucked so much though  I really hope tomorrow is better for you  If you're into guitar and want something new to distract you  may I suggest you look into Mike Oldfield  He was the third person to ever knock themselves off the number one spot of the charts in the UK  after the Beatles and Bob Dylan Come to Butthead   I know it's not just me haha  You didn't know me before posting this  Just consider their position though  They were born into their situation just like the people with disabilities  It's unfair to hate someone for something they can't change   like being black  gay  FA  or rich and attractive  Honestly  simplify your goal Don't think of the minimum of what you have to get in order to get in this 1 university  Your goal should be     Grind today  the next day  and the next day    If you strive for the best  you will go to the best  All you have is your best  If you give it your all you will get something great back  And I am proud of your effort to strive for more after getting a low GPA in high school  Some would quit  and you are not  Get that 4 0 Thank you so much   I hope you have a beautiful night    You're welcome  It's a very uncomfortable position to be in  so I would prefer to help you through it   u Tall Mickey is right about peanut butter as well  It carries plenty of protein if meat isn't your thing  so the apple peanut butter combo is definitely a win in two fields  I wish you luck  Hope your appetite curbs Well  there's a lot that is disappointing about this sub  but I like it when we support each other  I wish you all the lady luck too      Happy 2017 It's really not  If you keep trying and and keep pursuing  IT WILL HAPPEN  I promise you  It's the dedication that keeps certain people interested I know I'm going to have a miserable year because I'm still alive I do the whole emotionless thing  it just makes my parents think I don't give a shit about what they're sayingYeah but still suck at sports and not big yet even though I am working outI'm trying to be strong as possible  Thank you and Happy New Year  Stay safe out there bioavailabilty is higher in meat products for some things  however something like algae oil gets rid of that problem on the omegas  but plants can and do supply all necessary nutritional needs I box read party  still feel empty and angry    Even four months is not very long to know someone before moving in with them  especially if it's their place and you're essentially a guest  I get that living with your mom and stepdad is less than ideal  but from what you've said it's a stable and loving environment  just with too many rules  That doesn't seem to me like a good enough reason to leave  Doing chores every day is a reality no matter who you live with  and a curfew is annoying  but it's mostly for safety and is a pretty good idea as long as it's a reasonable curfew   If you feel like it's too early  maybe bring that up with your mom  as an adult living under her roof  you should have balance and compromise between the two of you   Also  don't underestimate the value of being able to save the money you'd otherwise be spending on car insurance and phone bills   I know from experience that living in someone else's house is tough  even if you get along well  and that it's a lot harder when it's an adult who's not a parent  I lived with my uncle for a few months while I was apartment hunting  He's great  and it was amazing to have a safe place to go  rent free  while I was figuring things out  But at the same time  I couldn't really be a full adult while living under his roof  but also didn't have the comfort of already having a parent child routine  because I'd never lived with him before  I suspect it would be the same with your girlfriend's parents  You're an adult  but you'd be in their space and dating their child  which kind of makes you a child too  regardless of age  It's uncomfortable to feel like you're in someone else's home   All in all  it seems like you're in a decent situation  and you shouldn't throw that away for an awkward one just because it's not ideal  Save up instead for your own place  with the girlfriend too if that's what you two want wow  that's deep   Even if someone oozed confidence but was still lacking in the looks department he would be constantly rejected left and right   I knew guys like this   Everyone liked them sure but dating  love  sex  etc   Oh yeah hell no I wont ask them  They'd make a big issue out of something that isnt serious  and they would do the exact opposite  these are alcoholics   I am trying the gluten free diet when I get home   I got flaked on too by friends this year and it does suck  I'm sorry you had that happen  happy new year  i don'r know if I want to go into detail  I just kind of want some general tips for me because I sometimes think I say something mean because of timing or just something that shouldnt havebeen saidI didn't get invited to do stuff but I'm exhausted from working the holidays    Might as well pick up a new year's shift  That's the spirit Hey  I'm at my first party ever as an adult since my bf of 15 years passed away 4 years ago  I already had social anxiety so as you can imagine it just got worse   I'm actually in the spare bedroom now  waiting to pass out because I actually had some drinks  Im drunk but it didn't suck and I had fun and I didnt get sloppy  I think   Go you  Go me    PS That took way too long too type  Maybe make a video of and instead of twitch live straining  just upload vidWhy is it only people who don't even post in this subreddit  or lurkers  allegedly  that make farewell threads    And judging by his post history  OP wasn't even FA before this god sent relationship of his   I find it pretty bizarre why people do this  I'm thinking it's just personal catharsis with the pretext of giving hope to us i also think that i may say some rue things  for example  by sometimes not accepting food offered by people im visiting  sometimes they make weird faces  so i think i said something  wrong  other times  I feel as if Im too harsh to people and as if they are thinking what im thinking which may result in me acting douchy  for example answering a question sarcastically like the other person should know the answer to  and saying things like "duh"  but i think in some cases this is good because their maybe some really obvious info that someone was supposed to know but they dont No  there's no guarantee that it will happen  You're a so ignoring the fact that most people here have been trying different things for years and nothing has worked  The whole "be yourself" thing doesn't work because that person is exactly who people dislike   There's no guarantees at all and people end up alone all the time  It happens  Good luck OP  I'm bisexual myself and I know what it's like to come out to family  I hope it goes brilliantly     If it's ok  keep us updated  I know it's annoying  but be happy they just want you to have a good time  They just don't understand what a good time is for you I tried it and unfortunately it didn't work  I really wish instagrams help center was better yay Did you get them working again  I just use the default iOS keyboard Perhaps if you spoke to your mother about it  he might take it better from her    Sounds terrifying and like an accident waiting to happen  Good luck get a vasectomyHi there  Im definitely no trained professional therefore I'm just giving my advice based on personal experiences  as I've struggled with depression and anxiety for a few years now  Im also young so I understand    It definitely seems like you have some anxiety  and mild depression  based on the mood swings and low self esteem  Don't take my word for it tho  I definitely suggest getting a real diagnosis from a trained professional   What I can help you with is coping skills  Coping skills is one of THE MOST important skills to have  So with the anxiety  what I recommend is breathing exercises  Focus on your breathing  and just have your internal cheerleader yelling   Keep telling yourself "hey not everyone is staring at me  They're looking at me but not judging me   AND if they are it's rather rude of them " Just reassure yourself and eventually you'll start to believe it   With the mood swings and depression  tell yourself this  it will past  Think about why the sudden shift  why you're feeling that way  what you can do about it  and do what you can that will positively help you  If you can't do something that's fine   Understand some things are out of our control and that is okay   When or if you start having violent wants  separate yourself from what you want to do  acknowledge that won't help you and distract yourself  Read a book  play games  ANYTHING to distract you  Distraction is very useful and helpful   I hope I helped a little bit    if these symptoms get worse or develop anymore please get help  Don't be afraid to ask for help  I was  and waiting only hurt me more      That's what you tell yourself  But TRULY put yourself out there and Test yourself  the results won't be anything worth doubting  people are not made to die alone You wouldn't be on this subreddit if you didn't feel that there was something wrong in being alone  So  do it and try  because if you don't you will live with that regret and that's a live you don't want to live You're absolutely welcome  Awesome to hear that you guys had a good time and evening  Happy new year    It is easy to lose sight of things  especially one another  Just keep at it  Always choose her at the end of the night  Not a game  It's been a common problem for my relationship as well  He would come home and jump on his video games instead of spending time with me  We rarely get time out together since we have a 7 month old but the time we do get together makes a world of difference   Best of luck    Sending you guys tons of love for the new year  I hope it's good to you  You know you're great  and you know you're deserving of love so test it and stop wasting your time I recently read  don't recall source  that one strategy is to throw a handful of treats in the direction of the approaching dog  to distract them while you do a U turn  I haven't yet tried this   Another thought might be to carry a miniature air horn in case things do escalate  I've heard this can sometimes break up a fight  but wonder if it might make the situation more traumatic for my already reactive dog   I live in a tight urban area where off leash dogs are becoming a huge trend  despite our leash laws  I've currently been diverting or blocking to avoid eye contact between the dogs  I have no reservations about using citronella or pepper spray if myself or my dog is in danger  but I worry about all three of us getting hit w  it  or rage from the other owner Can confirmI love Jackson Browne  He says exactly how I feel in his music  Weird  Make adult decisions  Suffer adult consequences  This isn't a game  If he doesn't do something that sacrifices his time  sleep  and sanity he will end up a poor loser that's a drain on everyone around him  In short he would be fucked  It's totally doable  But he isn't giving the vibe that he gets the gravity of his situation  But I'm not surprised  He's 17  He's naive  He's charting new territory so of course he's leaning on his parents  Are you doing OK  I'm good at chatting and telling shitty jokes  I've been there and I want you to feel OK about the next year   Then you must keep searching for that random thing that helps you out  For me  it was cooking http   www battlesports ca rage room    You're welcome  I'm also good looking  but very small endowedHappy New Year everyone You're right  My brother got a horrible girl pregnant and now he's going through hell  We used to have fun together but ever since this bitch ruined his life he hasn't been the same I meant to put this under her hahahaha If you are thinking  as per bronson  that the person is whatever he is bcoz of they way he was raised then read about steve jobs  The greatest entrepreneur  He was abandoned by his biological parents  He used walk miles to iscon temple so that he could have a nice one time meal  U can read more about him but the point is  it is possible to overcome the past experiences  We are the people  yes me too  And ur story reflects mine as well  who have to concure the past which many might not have experienced  We r not kids who were raised by reasonable understanding parents  I am glad that u are able think this in small age of 15  There are a few things you can do  if you have a friend that works at one of those places and they are a good employee  have them talk to a manager and they can tell a manager that you applied there  second you can try calling wherever you want to work and ask them if they got your application  this will increase your chance of being hired since it'll show that you actually want to work and it'll make them see your application  Good luck  "You wouldn't be on this subreddit if you didn't feel that there was something wrong in being alone"  Well that's not true hahaGood advice  Keep it short and regular  Long workouts will bore you Nope no one will like an broken mess self improvement may make yourself better and likeable but telling someone who obviously isn't in a good place people will like you for you just like that seems a bit shitty She sounds depressed because she feels like she has to hide who she truly is from her loved ones  Especially you  you're apparently the person she loves most  yes  Imagine feeling like you had to hide yourself from the person you love most because you felt like they wouldn't love the real you   I think you need to be unconditionally loving and open minded and accepting towards her and I'll bet you her life does a 180  Show her you love and accept her and that you support her regardless of her orientation  When you do this she will get better No  it's actually what I and many other people here actually experience daily  We've "put ourselves out there" and have been rejected every step of the way  We've been trying for years whether you want to believe it or not and have failed every single time  We haven't seen any results  only failure  And yes people aren't made to die alone  that's why it sucks to be alone  But that also doesn't guarantee that you'll ever find someone  People do die completely alone  It happens   We're on this sub because it's literally the only place in our lives where we can vent so we don't go insane by holding everything in    I'm really curious to know why exactly you just blatantly ignore the fact that most people here have done nothing but try for years and have still failed repeatedly  Why is that so hard for you to understand Who is the real her though     the stress of not getting any is far  far less than the stress of getting a girl pregnant  If that's the case  then why the fuck is Tinder such a successful app  Are so many people willingly subjecting themselves to this traumatic stress  Why are you even bothering with sex if it ails your mind so much    If you're willing to take it  but on the fence  I'd take the offer with its pay  but not hours  to your current management  See if they want to keep you or not  Experience To not see 2018 I'm so sorry you've had such a rotten year  It will get better  My first year of college was very similar to yours only I spent  5k on the boy who landed in a psych ward himself and I got pregnant  However  if I can recover  you can recover  too    Baby steps  Keep breathing  The human brain isn't fully developed until at least 26 and the judgement center is the last to finish up  When I found that out  I forgave myself for a lot of stuff  So keep moving and trying and it will get better  HUGSThat's a really productive goal man  I'm going to start setting nutritional goals based on health instead of body composition  Good luck Ya I wish there was a zombie apocalypse so Ellie could be my gfBoth hemp and fish oil are primarily unsaturated fats   Meaning they have several double or triple bonds between carbon atoms  which can easily bond with oxygen atoms   All unsaturated fats are susceptible spoiling rancidity     Saturated fats are less susceptible to spoiling or going rancid as there are no double bonds between carbon atoms  WOOO get it bro  this can open doors for you Floridian here  bust your butt  get that AA with a 4 0  I believe in you  It'll be hard but you can do it   And you should be able to transfer to any college    Also for the record UF   FSU in every educational aspect  And our grads have higher average salaries  Yeah I hope I win the lottery would be pretty crazy other than that no thanks I can live without world war 3 or some new super disease  Sounds to me you want a zombie acopalypse to happen I can get why you would find some parts appealing but I doubt you would press a button that would make it happen if you had one  because the amount of death and suffering would not be worth it  Also most pets would die do you want to live in a world without puppers and doggo's  And internet what about dank memes man Have you talked to your academic advisor  If not  I cannot recommend doing so more  This is the exact stuff they deal with Trust me on this  the older you get the less you care about people's respect on the internet Why the hell are people calling videogames vidya now  totally serious and curious here You still can find someone to be with  if you are willing to compromise  play more video games I'm sorry dude   I drove my car into a ditch at exactly midnight tonight and didn't do shit for fun so stuff happens    I can tell you that I stopped caring about holidays for the last few years and it feels amazing    It's just another day when you've had enough heartaches   I lost one of my best friends over growing apart amongst other things    It  happens to everyone when they get older  I'm in my 30s  but most people get content with what they've got   I spent Christmas nursing a hangover and opening an awesome present from my reddit secret santa   And it was great    Also my car was fine after driving into that ditch tonight but the police were awesome and it made my night that I was so lucky      I'm hanging out with a friend next week who has a new kid and feels lonely too so we'll be there for each other   Just need to stay close to the people that matter   Idk why you got downvoted for that I upvoted again hope you keep this energy trough 2017   LMFAO  thats what brought me here  Looked at my phone and started feeling depressed but coming to this sub always cheers me up  Big XOXOs Op Do what I did  eat chips and watch Bob Ross make paintings    I'm great at making detailed plans  but not so great at the action thing      Hi OP  just wanted to comment and say I really resonate with your post and particularly this comment    I made a really similar post a few weeks back asking for some advice on 'self love'  I haven't delved into all of the suggestions  many are books I don't have time for at the moment   but maybe you'll find some useful things there  1 6  You're a fucking idiot  Find someone who appreciates my audio engineering skills  In other words  get some clients  People say "do what you like and not worry what others think" regarding my music which is baloney because I have to impress someone to score a gig You don't have to hug  If she's the kind of person who's like one it could be a good idea  but if you don't know then that means it's too early for a hug anyways In the future you might need to warm the butter before using your eggbeater on it  It might have broke it indeed The mature thing to do here would be to sit your parents down  gently point out some issues  and say that this is why they should go to marriage counseling  They got married for a reason at some point  maybe they've just lost their way  You obviously care for your parents  so help them through this That's a good idea   Thank you  My part of wales is towns and villages and I have a car so I think for me putting the county is better I wish you both the best of luck as well  Even if things may never be perfect for us  all we can do is live with a mindful purpose and just "keep on keepin' on"  Happy New Year      I read it and still don't get it I didn't know either  but apparently it started on 4chan   http   knowyourmeme com memes vidyayou don't deserve anything at allIt's a cliche answer but  I plan to make working out a regular thing  The most I stuck to it last year was around a month and I only have a year or so to get in shape before I enlist  So aside that and continuing my education that's my primary goal  My "work" is basically just sitting at a desk  listening to music  watching videos  browsing posting on reddit  etc   so I don't mind  I work tech support in a call center on the night shift where calls are exceedingly rare  I enjoy what I do  so the calls don't even really bother me  but the vast majority of my shift is spent doing what I'd do anyway  So when I'm at home  I play games on PC or console  and at work  I just do internet stuff  Getting paid to do this is pretty amazing  I'm not rolling in cash  but I get enough to live comfortably "Period" is another method of birth control  although it severely limits how many times a month you can do your thing The hemp and flax seed oils I get  are locally produced and refrigerated during transport and at retail    I feel this is safer   Fish oils can't be used for eating  and taste like shit as pills   I think I will stick with the liquid versions I currently use   I like the science behind what you are saying  even though I don't understand it   The CBC marketplace that exposed many brands of fish oil to be rancid at sale permanently turned me off of fish based oils that would make sense You're not stupid  you just don't have a lot of experience  You just didn't think about other options because you were in a new situation and you were nervous  These things take exposure and practice sometimes  Next time you'll know There has to be something we can come up with   What if there was a social media group  maybe a private one  where we could say we are sat in x coffee shop and post it when we are there       I don't know  I am just throwing up ideas at the moment Wait does the message essentially boil down to accepting failure and faith  Because if that's the case I think I got it  Also what's livejournal She has to show you  The person she hides from you is the real her Find my purpose in lifeI actually was debating picking up FFXIV recently  but I don't really want to pay for a subscription  I also already own Black Desert so that's my MMO fix for the most part  On top of owning Destiny  But I'm down  Here's my realistic goals resolutions  Get in shape  Continue practicing guitar and become proficient at it  get treatment for my SA  Just those three  I think I can achieve these three by summer time   Good luck to you with your education  Where do you want to transfer to  what's your major   I'm going to set a reminder for 6 mo and ask yall how your all doing with your resolutions   RemindMe  6 monthsThe sub is pretty cheap like 12 99 and you get 30 days free  And I think I saw the base game  not HW  for like  10 on Amazon   I have BDO as well but I can't get over how restrictive it is D  What's your PSN I initially left a comment saying I really resonated with your post  and didn't think I had anything more to contribute other than linking to another post I made earlier asking for similar advice    But I just remembered some things and for what it's worth I thought I'd share    maybe it could help   First  one of my counsellors told me that a history of negative self talk is incredibly difficult to get out of  because it's your brain's go to way of processing responding to the world    Developing positive thoughts is literally something that you need to train your brain to be able to do  She encouraged me to start small and try to focus on a few things I could tell myself that I genuinely believed which would help me feel better in that moment  I was extremely frustrated upset with myself because I thought I had gotten over my anxiety  but she said encouraged I take 'baby steps' and acknowledged that it is a long  long process that won't be fixed in a day  These little positive statements are similar to CBT but not as onerous  Although generally it would be great to practise challenging your thoughts and respond in a way that kindly questions whether what you think is true and or helpful    I also recently discovered this subreddit and I'm trying to really internalize the positivity and love in these posts  https   www reddit com r wholesomememes   Know that you are worthy OP  You are not your past  The fact that you're posting this means you have the self awareness that many people don't to acknowledge you may have hurt people  but want to be better and do better  Take pride in this    After reading your post another few times  I also wonder if it would help for you to write a letter or email or post to these people you feel you've wronged  You don't have to send it  but it sounds like you have a lot of guilt resentment that maybe you could let out    Even if it's a "Hi       I know it's been years since we talked but I have been doing some reflection lately and I feel terrible about X  I was hurt  but I shouldn't have done what I did  I'm so sorry "   There's a chance that if you do send it  the person may not accept this apology  so maybe be prepared for this  But you are not your past  and every day is a new day  and this is a new year    Wishing you well OP  Also leaving this quote to remind you  as well as myself to be hopeful for the future    "Just because the past didn't turn out as you hoped doesn't mean your future can't be better than you ever imagined "     My mom AND dad both wished me happy new year  go me Getting a high GPA in high school is like medaling in the Special Olympics  Sure it "counts" but there's bigger leagues  Yeah  it's like 30 days and you can level all classes to 20 IIRC   In addition Stormblood is coming out next summer so you get caught up by then This is what scares me about the internet  you can have these awesome friendships with some cool people  and then all of a sudden they're all gone and you have nothingNo  I just said that because that sub is filled with toxic people so frequenting that sub won't help in any way  and if you're there people can assume your one of the toxic people and lash out  Also I never said or implied you deserve bullying for the actions of others but maybe the reason people don't respond positively to your posts or comments because you seem hostile like saying fuck you for no reason  To finally not be a pussy and kill myselfYeah  I didn't get one message either Of course it was 4chan haha wtf thanks for giving a link I apreciate it I sold my old PS3 with all of my games  and bought a PS4 on Black Friday  Maybe it sounds miserably but it's really important to me  because video games help me not fall into depression Some of us just have crippling depression   I actually already have HW from an old Humble Bundle so that's set and my PSN is Munishin  Hello  I see that your relation with your mother wasn't the best either  I'm sorry to hear that and thanks for your help  If you don't mind the question  did you decide back then to go to the tech school  I want to attend another school too  I don't like what I'm studying and I'm afraid it would be too late now to change schools  But also my parents chose that for me  so I should be grateful and appreciate it  or not  I don't know  I'm feeling guilty to admit I don't like what they did for me  I mentioned those living conditions so that I can compare it to others'  to the people that don't have those and their problems are real  mine are not  I'm just complaining  I would like to contribute to the society with all I can  but I can't solve everything  then I'm feeling guilty  I will check out the book you mentioned  I know our problems aren't the same so I will instead read it rationally  I hope you're doing well  have a good day I wish I could be a neet Hello internet stranger and happy new year  I'm very glad that you are now willing to seek professional help  It's a big step to take but it's a step that makes all the difference  Sometimes  when we're stressed out or facing depression  our opinions and view of the world gets clouded and warped  A therapist will help you clear up that cloudiness and help develop the tools to flourish    If you ever need a friend or just someone to talk to  feel free to DM me  I've been in similar shoes  and heck  am still facing mental health battles of my own   maybe we can help each other  Besides  I always like talking to new people    Yeah I assumed that hence why I said non incel's may lash out there because allot of people there are toxic  with all the worshipping the elliot guy thinking we should have acces to pure young children for sex stuff and let's not forget the sex slaves lol  Why not just be in this sub  they are pretty similar in purpose but it's less toxic here  Hey  I know this might sound like a stupid and random question but were you the group of guys and girls at the Jarry metro station at approx  1 am headed towards Cote Vertu Sorry I couldn't finish in the post it said the purchase was official but I checked my bank info and it charged me for the 3 failed purchases And remember  in the grim dark future there is only war I was basically the same  very little social skills  rarely got out of the house    And one day  I decided to take up a sport  So I chose longboarding  and decided that I'd also overhaul the rest of my life in the process  I got involved in a lot of Facebook groups  started getting out and going to group rides in the city  Soon after I started talking to some of them a bit more  asking to learn the more difficult part of longboarding  sliding   I started hanging out more and more  and made a ton of amazing friends  Now I've got highly improved social skills  relative to the initial 0   great friends that I love and a sport I never get tired of    Try something new  Get involved in a community  You'll see how quickly you make friends who you share an interest with   Good luck I understand it's your house and you feel she should take her responsibilities seriously  But you can't drive her to do them cuz from what I understood she's extremely adamant  What I suggest is you stop taking any sort of initiative to help her out  She's gonna be a crybaby about it  no doubt but eventually she will have to do what ever is required from her  Be extremely rude and tell her that you'll kick her out if she doesn't do her duties  It might be her room  her laundry but it's your house and your life she's disturbing  Give her and ultimatum and do not let her take you in a light way  I think it's high time you stop letting her ruin your family life  She must understand your priorities are different after marriage because you have a new family and son to look after  You can always tell your mom to take her back in  No 20 yo is a responsibility of someone else except themselves I wouldn't think so based on your description  Sometimes we get stuck in parties we don't fit into  Don't blame yourself  It was an awkward situation  give yourself permission to feel weird  and move on to tomorrow  I don't think there's much to be learned ruminating on this Sounds good  You're very lucky  3Update   50  fluent and it's not even inauguration yet   I hope to be out by mid year at latest Don't focus on the long term  Make a schedule for yourself and focus on your goals one day at a time  Most of school is about jumping through hoops  If you jump through all the hoops and do a generally good job  you will meet the minimum GPA  There is no point in focusing on the big picture if you cannot handle the day to day routine  Break it down and focus on the daily work load Obviously this is different for different people  but I'll give you my view of adult life after highschool  I'm 21 now    You don't have 'bffs' in the adult world  'adult world' being that time when you get sick of partying hard every weekend   Your friends consist of people who you can visit at their place and have a nice dinner and talk about interesting current events  or perhaps go out to a bar and have a couple of drinks  Your definition of a 'friend' changes  I have plenty of friends that I never see outside of university and work  and I couldn't tell you where most lived  I couldn't tell you what their favourite colour is  or when their birthday is  or their middle name  or how many siblings they have  Half of the time  I forget how old they are  From my admittedly limited experience  being incredibly close with any one person always leads to drama and falling outs and petty fights  and most adults are simply too busy and too tired to deal with all of that    But I enjoy spending part of my day with each of my friends  and that's all that matters  I'm not going to mentally rank them according to how much they mean to me or anything  As for trust  I wouldn't trust anyone with really sensitive information as everyone is a gossip in some sense  and I wouldn't want to give my friends that temptation    So  no  you're never going to find your 'perfect best friend'  but neither does anyone else  Life doesn't get easier after highschool  as highschool is one of the easiest times in your life  After you turn 18  or 21 depending on your country   you have to take full control of your own life and accept the consequences for any choices you make  There is no one to teach you how to fill out the forms properly  and there are serious ramifications and no second chances if you get it wrong  But life is  better  after highschool  Freedom of movement and larger social circles mean that you'll never be stuck with any one group of people  If you don't like your friends  you just find new ones  If you can't find any new ones  you just move or you suck it up  Take this for whatever it's worth    I used to have a mentor when I was younger  and I'd say similar things to him    His response   "Ask her to get a sandwich with you "  Granted  he's considerably older than me  so that exact phrasing might be a little dated  but the idea and thought cuts through all the overthinking that I typically spin my wheels on    Asking someone to share a meal with you is pretty low risk  low chance of rejection  and sets the stage for progressing if it's something the two of you are both interested in   If she's into someone else  she may just say no to make her situation clear to you  in which case  you have your answer and you don't look like a goon   Also  it's just a thing people who are good at being sociable would do   I'm bad at that  so I had to be told this    You haven't made clear what your current level of familiarity is with this person  so you might be past this stage  but if not  maybe that helps put things into perspective   Edit  I think what my mentor was suggesting was literally "hey let's go grab something to eat sometime"  not "hey I'd like to orchestrate an elaborate courtship outing involving dinner at a nice restaurant" Lol why     take him a blanket and go the hell to bed  You tried I'll add you in a bit Well see now i'm just confused you want a relationship yet hate all women  and I kinda agree with the bluepill sentiment but your simply not going to find allot of confident men here since this a sub about being unable to find a relationship  If you just want sex but don't wan't to wait why not go to a prostitute Hang in there  Cliche as it sounds  it's a new year and there's always chance for a new start  or to change  Always here to talk  stay safe and a very happy new years to you    Read your syllabus  attendance and class participation are likely part of your grade Australian woman here  Don't move to Australia with him unless you're 100  positive you and him are rock solid  I know plenty of young women here who moved across the world to be with the Australian man they fell in love with  And many of them have gone on to have a child only to have the relationship fall apart  You will be stranded in Australia with no support and unable to leave the country to return home with your child  I'm not saying all relationships have ended like this  but I live in a very multicultural part of Sydney  and meet many foreign woman  particularly Europeans and South American  in this situation and they are miserable   He is a waste of time honey  Don't bother  All the best xAt least your character is strong  I'm only level 85 in bloodborne  last night tried dueling like 8 times and lost all of them  everyone has these overpowered DLC weapons and advanced yolo swag bloodknightvampirebeastmage builds  And here I am  Keemstar4997  who knows two things  hit fast with R1 or hit slow but big with R2  Neither of them is paying out so far If you handed in work late  there are penalties applied to your final grade  Some professors will impose a limit but mark you normally otherwise  so an assignment that is a day late can only get a maximum of 80   even if it's perfect  Others just scale you down and take off points  so you might lose 10  from your final grade  regardless of what grade you got  Unless you've already taken that into account with your calculations  probably just accept your grade  Prevention is a hell of a lot different than treatment   Studying people who are already diseased isn't a fool proof way to say "this does nothing"  Drugs will help but it's important to be highly aware of addiction and dependence  That's a shitty situation you're in friend  Im sorry for the stress she's put you through  Do you mind if I ask how old is your sis and the girl in question   I have never dealt with your exact situation but it's just a more recent flavor of rebellious teen sounds like  They think they know everything and everything their parents say is wrong  the girl probably acts out at home as well  either that or their parents view themselves as "progressive" and let her do whatever she wants  I e  walk all over them     To be honest  there's a hair thin line that you have to walk with your sister that's somewhere between "this girl is bad for you  we don't want you hanging out with her because we care" and "we accept you for who you are and we just want you to be happy"   It's essentially letting her figure it out on her own but giving her just enough guidance to not get herself in trouble        This may not help much but the best of luck to you and the most important thing is that you stay strong and try not to explode from the ignorance I've found them all to be unbearably boring and repetitive and just a massive waste of time  My brother played Archeage for a while and it was painful thinking about how someone could spend their time monotonously grinding for  nothing   I agree entirely  But you almost have to go out of your way to do that poorly  It is good to have the feedback   Thank you for replying   In a lot of cases I guess we probably wont like the other person   But then just a smile and a little "Hi" from someone like ourselves would brighten our day I think  and make some of us feel a little less alone and isolated   It could be the tiny little spark that brings two people together next time their paths cross Making friends as an adult gets harder I'm sorry to say  You may make some acquaintances at work but it's ill advised to make much more at work  as the saying goes don't mix business with pleasure and there are very good reasons for that      In highschool you're forced to hang around lots of people  this makes making friends much easier  Likewise in highschool you can't get fired and your livelihood doesn't depend on it  That doesn't exist in adulthood  you have to actively seek friendships in adulthood         There are no perfect scenarios in life  Instead of focusing on a perfect ideal of what people should be and trying to squeeze real people into that  just find people you get along with and go from there  Perhaps your problem is that you've found yourself attached to the wrong friend group  Contact xbox support and tell them what happened  they should be able to credit you or return the money back I definitely understand where you're coming from and I'm going through a bit of a similar situation as well at the moment   While I really don't want to be mean and even though I know you had the best intentions  I can tell you that what you did was only for you   I'm not calling you a bad person or anything  but it's just the truth   What happened is that she decided that she didn't want to talk to you anymore  and going no contact probably helped her to move on   When you contacted her it brought up a lot of feelings that she likely wanted to forget or had moved on from  and she just didn't want to go through it again   Again  I have to say that doing what you did doesn't make you a bad person because you genuinely wanted to be positive and apologize  but unfortunately the best way to apologize and to help her is just to leave her alone   Best of luck though and happy new year What does it mean when someone acts this way   i just dont rly get it So sad to read this    I hope you get tested and treated very soon  Sending hugs   Nah  it's grinding for phat loot  Ionno  I prefer MMOs over everything else to each their own I guess  c   Your friends consist of people who you can visit at their place and have a nice dinner and talk about interesting current events  or perhaps go out to a bar and have a couple of drinks    I'm old enough to be your grandfather and this is completely wrong           Your definition of a 'friend' changes  I have plenty of friends that I never see outside of university and work  and I couldn't tell you where most lived       Those are acquaintances  not friends  Huh  27 for me  so I guess I can believe it Try not to worry about it too much   It's very normal to feel bad and maybe even a little guilty as well  but you did the right thing   Just keep in mind that it would have been worse of you to string her along when you didn't really feel anything anymore   The only thing you can do now is to avoid making her life confusing  as in don't constantly call or text without the intention of getting back together  and wait it out   Time is really the only cure for these types of things   Best of luck and happy new year I can't speak to Italy or American education overseas  but I do know this    Take all the biology and chemistry courses you can  All of them  At as high a level as you can  If you can take anatomy  even better  If there are any other courses that relate to medicine or that you can relate to a subspecialty of medicine that you care about  right now   E g studying psychology  sociology  or a foreign language  or even computer programming  then take that too  Also take statistics and learn Excel  which is good for anyone  Become a strong  self disciplined student   Then volunteer anywhere medical  Hospitals  clinics  blood drives  fundraisers  nursing homes  anywhere you can to both get a feel for the field and and network  Network  network  network  Getting even one recommendation from each place you go can help you apply a lot of places  Be wary though  you won't be the only kid doing so and the field is infamous for big egos  bad manners  and hyper competition  Toughen your skin   Then do any projects you can related to medicine  Tinker with low grade medical tech  see if you can put together a small study of something  get an EMT or equivalent license  and so on  Basically put yourself in the mindset that you are already in medicine  practicing medicine at the level you are qualified to  and working through to practice at higher levels  This is your life 24 7  enjoy it and don't lose frame   And then start working on applications  Sell yourself as an existing asset to the medical community looking to advance  not some kid who just wants to be a doctor  And be prepared to still be told no because the competition really is that tough   And then when you do go somewhere there is a whole new world I am not qualified to speak for   Good luck  Whenever you see each other you both say that you are going to hang out but  you both know that you never willThere's a ton of medication for it depending on your diagnoses  I was expecting at least one guy who I'm friends with to send me a Happy New Years  but apparently he's not in town   and I'm afraid to think what he did on New Year's Eve    Sounds good  For friends from college they're pretty much people in my club that I have a bunch of classes with  I'd consider a good amount of these friends to be good friends  It's a big group so it's hard to be friends with everyone   Most of my other friends are from high school  like 4 6 or so  or previous places I've worked  I consider all of these people good friends  We've only stayed in contact for so long because we're all pretty good friends now   The only surefire way to make friends is to find a thing your interested in and join a club or something that does it  For us it's a club focused on computers and programming  For you it could be anything  There's a club for tons of stuff you're bound to meet people you get along with   Work is more hit or miss for making friends  And then usually they're just work friends  not invite them over to hang out friends I really liked bad Ben  It's on amazon primePlease don't hurt yourself in any way and if it's getting serious please consider the hotline in the sidebar or a therapist    Keep in mind that the whole new year new me thing is just something that people say when they don't really know what they want to change in the new year   Think instead of new year better me   Try to think about some aspects of your life that you want to change or improve   They can be general as long as you make specific goals to target them  both big and small   When you start reaching them you'll feel better and better   Best of luck and feel free to pm me any time if you need to talk Nah I don't think he has APD Hey man  I was in the EXACT same boat as you     I had exactly ONE friend from high school  and he was my best friend because he was my ONLY friend  Anyone else who was "friends" with me either didn't get close with me  or only used me to get help for projects    I didn't have real friends in high school  I'm in my first year of university  where I met people with the same interests as me  didn't have that in school   and I could easily make a group of friends    It's been 4 months since I made these new friends and now I know that I could trust these people with my life   Hang in there man  you're only in high school  Even if you don't end up making many friends in university  you'll be able to at least make 1 REAL friend  and that's what matters the most   My one friend in high school is still one of my best friends  and he helped me get through high school    But just because I had one friend didn't mean the end of the world for me  I knew that I had to get out of high school  because I wouldn't find the right friends here   I just kept my hopes up for university  and it worked   If you need to talk more  I'm here  PM me whenever   I'm actually having a really hard time tonight  new years  so it was nice to read that  My SO and I are having a hard time because we're long distance and ready to move in together  but it's not easy to make that transition  I've been on the verge of tears all night     And I've been feeling super clingy towards him but resisting it as much as I can Hah  That was good  You drank    and it was not safe to drive    Do they have family close by that you could reach out to  You could also contact a suicide hotline and ask for help on the subject thanks a lot  I can see her getting more defensive if I approach this in a confrontational way    I'll take balance as the key word here    Money is awesome  It allows you to eat better food  take frequent nicer vacations  live in a nicer area  not worry about bills etc  Pretty much everything in life outside of relationships and health are impacted by how much money you have  I have a great life outside of being FA and I wouldn't feel this way if I was struggling financially Call the bank Hence my disclaimer "Obviously this is different for different people  but I'll give you my view   "  It's my definition of a friend  and it has never changed  I have never invited anyone over to my house  even as a child  so maybe my view of friends is a little different  good job I'm so sorry and I understand completely how you feel   Going off of what you said in another comment though  remember that it's only been four days   Give yourself time to be sad and remember that it's a natural part of the healing process   You won't be getting any better if you're hiding how you're feeling and lying to yourself   Speaking from experience  be happy that he removed you from Facebook   It seems like a cruel thing to do but trust me in saying that you don't want to be seeing what he's doing anytime soon   Try to also delete ways to contact him and this is the most important thing   Delete his snapchat and phone number now  along with pictures or anything else that will remind you of him and hurt you   Doing this right away will help you very much   I completely get your situation and how hard it is  so again I'll say that it's ok to be sad   Remember though do not contact him or anything of the sort   Try to detach as much as possible so that you can heal   Best of luck   Stay strong and pm me if you ever want to talk about it or vent   I know exactly what you're going through and it's the worst feeling in the world  but I promise you'll get through this I would accept it and leave  Dude gave you so much leniency and even when you skip class and crap and hand stuff late and shit You can be nerd  emo  punk  introvert  extrovert  anything you want  people doesn't really care  If you are attractive  chicks will love you  If you are not  they won't  I played Dota 2 for a long time  got to know a lot of people who had high ranks and literally played all day all night  despite being like 22 24  I always imagined them as spotty fat virgins  until a Dota 2 group for my country was started on facebook  I got invited and saw many of my long time online friends  Boy  I was wrong  80  of them were normies  with pretty girlfriends  One of the biggest nerds in our group  who even joined to an official hungarian team and played tournaments for real money looks like a badass viking  with tall  ripped body and with godlike beard  He always showed us pictures of him with his new girlfriends  they looked like fucking models       Just imagine  if you would attend to paid tournaments of some video game  and practice all day all night  what would girls  or anyone  think about you  You would be a pathetic sad loser  who still plays stupid video games at the age of 25  But apparently  if you are attractive  you would be "cute" and "aaahhh  such a nerd  3" If they use social media like Facebook you can report them and facebook will dispatch the police EMT I think    Facebook suicide report  https   m facebook com help contact 305410456169423    Other than that the best thing you could do is ask if they want to talk on the phone and call them and assess how far they are in planning    suicide guidance checklist   http   www suicide org how to help a suicidal person html  is a good resource on what to say     The best option is to get them to call the suicide prevention hotline 1 800 273 8255  even if they are just super depressed they will have a judgement free resource to talk to that will help them cope     I hope everything works out   Just try and be as compassionate and caring as possible and reassure the person that you are there for them while trying to get them more qualified help Honestly just focus on school and get that 4 0 then worry about where to go later  Colleges don't matter  Your degree and knowledge and shown skills do   When you have that 4 0 colleges and universities will be trying to suck your dick for you to get in   Also because you might change majors or coursework ideas etc  Best wishes  Happy new year Happy New Year   Hope I die this year What do you need help for Oh   yep  I can relate to this "That after college  you don't really make many new friends and life is mostly lonely "  I'm sure people saying this have not graduated from college and have no first hand experience  Sure it might  seem  to them that people live boring lives because their lives aren't constant partying as a 20 something  but this is not the real case for the people they are walking about   Life is what you make of it  One should not to put blame on something else if he she feels lonely or feels like life is not fulfilling the expectations   It is what it is  Another night at bar   but for a purpose   New Years Eve  I saw friends which was ok  But now I'm home  drunk  4 30am  sad  New year resolution   stop going to bars I know  I get nothing  Not even a kiss on new years   '  It's 4 30am  I'm home now  drunk  sad You should continue to look elsewhere and assume the job with him won't happen but check at the end of the month  That's when he said he would know more  I think you already let him know you're interested and it is important to follow up  but I don't think you will gain anything by asking sooner  You are gay too Can you provide links for those claims  "Proven to cause long term brain damage" is a serious statement  Thank you   resolutions are for people who lack initiative  MeYeahPut a letter in their mail saying   Picture "this hose that you usually use to water your plants draws from our water bill  We do not want that  If you do not fix this issue within a week we will cut the hose off  literally  "  As a teen she isn't going to rebel  just is and you have to understand this inside of that context  This isn't really something for a sister to deal with unfortunately  this is where your parents need to just cut her off from this girl and accept she's going to be mad about that for a time       For your part  perhaps the only thing you can realistically do is try to explain to her after your parents cut her off  that this girl has a lot of emotional problems that your sister doesn't want to get mixed up in and you think your parents cut her off out of love for your sister and the desire to see her succeed  It's so much work that I understood very early that very few people would stick around long enough to discover it    So I got a 6 pack and at least some women loved me  It was for my abs but I still had more people loving me  I don't think the blood room is a good advice    You're young you have time to learn emotions  Your parents seem to be the extra worried type  is it true   Look on Google about assertiveness  it might helpThose are acquaintances  Perhaps you've never had friends  I'm not in engineering  but I am in physics which encourages a similar style of thinking    We learn to think logically  critically  and in an efficient manner because we have no other option  We're given questions to solve that are difficult  intricate  and confusing  and getting it wrong is not an option  Those who are not capable of taking all that they have been taught and reading up on the things they have not  or are unable to apply all of that  will fail and drop out  In some senses  I think it's a self selection process so I'm not sure how successful you'd be at improving at logical thinking if you're not predisposed towards it  Only the physicists who are already logically minded  or who can learn quickly  will get through to graduation  But there is certainly something about realizing that you're going to spend the next 3 7  depending on if you go for a PhD  years of your life having to solve those problems  that makes you work to streamline the whole problem solving process  Same  kinda have to stick around due to family  Hopefully random chance takes care of it for me You're right about the work being hit or miss   the few jobs I've had I'm only close with a few of my coworkers  Good to hear you've made some good friends in college  looking forward to that myself Yep  it's 10 30 am now and zero message    And say that they were all saying we were friends  Some of them told me that a few days ago   But there is always this feeling of "maybe they are waiting for ME to send them a message   and if I don't they will think I don't care about them and I don't want them in my life" Sadly  Most girls already have someone  And if the girl is alone    Most likely dating someone EVERYONE DOES  BUT WOMEN NEED LOVE TO GIVE LOVE NOT HATE  It's not stooping low if you just enjoy yourself plenty of people do it and it might make you happier   Also I am far from a "normie" but in this case ill take it as a compliment   Computers    imo take a big self built tower at home and a minimal laptop Hope it goes well OP  I really wish it goes smoothly and your parents understand  D I am bi myself so it makes sense of all of the stresses  but just let yourself be free Currently trying to keep my hopes up too  I only have like 5 months left so that's not too bad  Thanks for the encouragement  looking forward to finally leaving high school behind and moving forward Same for me    Life is going on  uneventful That's certainly true  But I game as well  mostly on Xbox one  and I've met a couple girls who do as well  It is possibleNo girl is going to find me attractive just because of my clothes  or because I'm funny  Most girls date based on looks entirely  especially in high school and university  Not like it's a bad thing  I'm not bashing them  they have every right to do it  It's just a simple fact Let's agree to disagreeAbsolutely disgusting  Long headaches and constant drowsy feeling  I'm in a highly introverted and isolated field of study  so it's the norm amongst my colleagues and peers at least  Different people have different expectations for their friends  we don't all have to be the same 22 Here  guess I'm still a rookie     I really needed this today    Could have done without the crying  but they were happy tears and I will not be ashamed of looking like a blubbering child right now  Great job  So much people keep others in their life because it's easy and familiar  It takes guts to remove someone from your life  At times  its best to let things break for people to truly appreciate their true value  What I would do for your sis if I was in your shoes is to ensure that when things fall apart  the lesson is leant with minimal damage as any other solution I can think of will be a short term solution as the same mindset would still be in place that met her to fall under that girl's influence  Just minimise the emotional and mental damage and let consequence teach the lesson  I don't know honestly  If she sends you nudes just like that  before you guys even met  that is a huge red flag in my opinion  Are you sure she wasn't fake  I'm not unattractive nor obese so in theory I should be able to obtain a reasonably attractive GF  but my skills are below par  When I search dating sites the girls I click on lead me to realize "these girls will get hundreds of messages and will have plenty of suitors who are either more attractive or wealthier than myself"  I'd like to think I have reasonable physical standards but at 34 I want someone who doesn't have kids  doesn't want any new kids  and is financially responsible  These traits are difficult to find I actually kind of liked FF  It was the first MMO I've ever played  I quit playing it for a while but I've been thinking about getting back into it  The downside is that it tends to pull away hours at a time Hi Vix  I'm 20  this is kind of an alt account and I don't want to share the country I'm from  I'm sorry  Also I feel that would influence maybe the replies  not only on this sub   You seem to have a lot of hobbies and your days surely aren't boring  it was just so uplifting to read what you wrote  I think even though as you said you're the opposite of me  there is something we seem to have in common  but somewhere the whole theory splits  I want to find that point   ''You only get one life  so make the best of it ''   And I think I took it too seriously  I don't know what makes me an asshole person that's opinion is to be part of everything  be everywhere and do only good deeds  I want people to notice me  to be a hero  and as I have only one life I must work all day and all night to save as many as I can  All my other problems in life are secondary  inferior  I only care about this  I only want this part of me to disappear  or to be solved  I feel way too bad for being so egoistic  Whenever I made those rewards for myself too  I had the feeling that I didn't deserve it  or rather there should be no reward at all  only work and work  and then my death will pay for it sometime    ''A person can't be productive 100  of the time  or they would become bitter and sad  Or they would feel guilty and empty inside ''   What if someone's that disappointed that they don't mind being sad and guilty  because they feel it's their ''job'' and they need to carry on doing it whatever it takes and whatever else they will miss out in life  and they shouldn't complain  This is what I'm feeling  I can't relax or schedule 1 hour of video games for example anymore  I'm now home from the college and I haven't had any good moments since it started  one day I said  screw school  my job  and everyone in the world  I'm going to read and play games all day  cook what I want  dress how I want  call up my friends  listen to music  I especially love the piano  it always makes me cry in joy  This happened I guess about four days ago  then I decided to write this post because I felt incredibly childish  irresponsible and guilty of that day  and I wasted it on doing nothing  The fact that I'm feeling guilty and deep down I want to have fun in life  that makes me guilty too  and it goes round and round   I promise I will try  or find exactly what I need to try  what I have to do to stop this  I want to thank you for your help  and have a happy new year   Unfortunately  that means you don't mean as much to him as he means to you  for lack of subtler phrasing  which is incredibly sad  From the sounds of it  you deserve someone a lot better  Trust me  there will be people who will make you laugh like he does  that you know you can trust  Go catch em  girl    Lol  I love it  I think that people who can easily find a new partner are less likely to give 100  to their current partner  Human nature  sadly  A lot of people on this forum sound like they would be amazing dedicated partners   ' Well my friend told me she loved me  But she fucking lied  I found out she just told everyone that  My sister said that she had to remove EVERYTHING when she had her car shipped from San Diego to Honolulu  The military paid for the

' The problem is that anxiety and depression themselves cause cognitive dysfonctions  It is hard to prove  studies are still run and we need bigger studies to have results  As these fields fail to get the big financements    The interest for Alzheimer the last years in Europe will surely give new tools for assessment   However for now the benefit risk ratio tend more to the use of antidepressants and bzd following strict prescription rules  Do not ignore the benefits of anticonvulsant when you have depressive syndrome with a "blurred anxiety syndrome"Holy cow  I read this post  and then went

friends  Just standing around awkwardly while everyone else kissed  It now also 5am  I'm finally in bed   but have cried my eyes out   ' How often I already said those exact words man this Thread is sad but very familiar I really  really tried to make it work  But sometimes  there comes a day when enough is enough  Personally  I am a firm believer in not telling anybody  They own their life  and often suicide is a last resort in gaining some form of control  To go to the police or the family would almost certainly make the situation worse  as no amount of argument  forced restraint  or  most likely  lack of understanding from loved ones  which is most often what drives them to the position  will change their minds   What you need to do is step away and allow them the room to figure things out  If they're telling you  then they're far less likely to act upon their desires  You need to wait until they are back within a period of normality  and you need to bring it up with them  Talk with them as a friend  but do not push advice  and do not order  These actions will only make the situation worse   Hang out with them  have fun with them  make them feel like they're worth something indirectly  without ever pushing the topic If you like RPG's try out Witcher 3  I just picked it up on PS4 and it's great  I wanna play Overwatch so badly but there's no sale on it in the PSN store and the full price for it feels a little too expensive Go with a half truth half lie approach   You didn't know the punch had alcohol in it until after you'd already had a glass   You only drank one glass and it must not have been very strong  because it didn't taste that bad  But you wanted to err on the side of caution  and didn't want to risk driving afterwards   If they insist on trying to make a big deal about how alcohol got into the punch tell your parents that you're not going to get anyone in trouble  and you had hoped that you'd proven your judgement by getting a ride home  Tell them that will have to be enough for them   It's tough to take the "righteous anger" angle when you're lying your ass off  but if you can it's super effective Wow  gay guy here  32  but I feel your pain  I'm sorry you've gone through all this     Great   I do the same    Don't feel sorry for sharing your passions  You'll always find people who will appreciate it even if they don't show up  And that's fine  but what makes an acquaintance verse what makes a friend are objective definitions  not subjective      I think it only becomes cheating when you feel the need to hide these things from your boyfriend so I don't think you cheated  I also think it's normal to like the attention   However  I think you should be careful because it sounds like you could find yourself in a position where you do end up cheating  Slippery slope and all    Gay guy here   but yes  it's all about looks   ' I need money for video games and computer hardware peripherals I agree  I'm in the same situation  Quitting doesn't mean you gave up  It means you were aware of what was going on and you chose to stop  Be strong  This too shall pass I hope the links to the proper subs help     Sounds like anxiety  I agree with the first post that you need to talk to someone and maybe get some meds  One of the ways anxiety manifests is through racing thoughts and worry   As a fellow lover of the Herb  are you

drivers what you're doing and give them space to figure out what they're doing   It may help to enforce a rule  people can decide if they want to ride in your car  but they can't tell you what to do

 Mum and I have reconciled  but I can't be here at the same time as other folks  That means that   a  I can't do Christmas Easter here anymore  and  b  I need to jump ship from this place  the earlier the better   Thank you so much for your advice though  I honestly think it's good advice and I lost nothing by giving it a shot  and it at least made me feel like the more reasonable person in the

basically caused me to fail a few classes in college What does sjw mean Passionate  extremely touching  Thanks Of course the definition of friendship is subjective  If I believe that I'm friends with someone  and they also believe that we're friends  who can say otherwise    I hang out with my friends when schedules permit  I go drinking with them  we have inside jokes  we go on trips together  I have helped them out when they needed it  and they have helped me in return  we give and receive advice between each other  I have had my friends cry on my shoulder and I have done the same to them  I would not hesitate to protect their name and I am sure they would do the same for me  What arbitrary standard of yours do my friendships not meet  Is there some minimum amount of money or time I have to dedicate to them before I can call them friends  Is it  100 and 15 7 hours a week I drove from New York to Oklahoma in June  The big things for me were    Make sure you've eaten  When you're getting sleepy and you can't really pinpoint why  taking a break and getting some food in your system can be a great reset  Had to drive all night through Tennessee Arkansas  and taking a half hour stop and eating some Wendy's salad made the biggest difference in my mindset and energy levels    Keep yourself occupied  but not so much that you get distracted   I made up some awesome playlists for the daytime  and enjoyed comedians or books on tape for the evening   Don't make the mistake of finding a comedian so hilarious you almost swerve into the next lane laughing  it's scary     Use AirBnB if it's an option for you   This saved us a shit ton of money  honestly  I had someone with me  so I felt less weird about staying at another person's house  but you can often book an empty house apartment if you plan ahead    You can go 60 on the highway  Just stay in the right or middle lane  and as long as you're not blocking people it doesn't matter  It'll save you gas  and help you feel in control and not like you're rushing  because honestly going 10 20 faster doesn't make that much of a difference     Start planning now  and map out places you're interested in visiting  if you have any extra time  This will help you stay motivated and excited instead of nervous    If you're worried about budgeting  buy lots of chips  yogurt  and sandwich supplies and make yourself food instead of "eating out"  Try to avoid night driving  it's just shitty and stressful when you're first learning  Get enough sleep and wake up early   it's worth it   Don't be scared to get off the road if you feel uncomfortable  It's better to lose some time or have to make another plan than to get in an accident     I hope this all makes sense  I'm not 100  sober right now  but I know that if I save this I'll never come back  and I wanted to give you advice because I made almost this exact trip this summer    Anyway  best of luck  and I bet you can do this  I hope the drive goes well and you have some neat experiences along the way  Why didn't you go I hope it is something that is easily fixable   But if not  i'll tell you what you will do   You will be okay   You will talk with your doctor  maybe get therapy  maybe try meds   Lots of other things can help  like meditation  diet changes  exercise  Depression and anxiety can get better and can even go away in some people     Best of luck to you Why would you have bird flu just because you came in contact with a bird of some description  O o       You take the bird to a vet and go from there  Actually saving the bird is going to cost you moneyThanks   I was honestly starting to think horrible things of myself just for liking the attention  Anyway I do not go to parties without my boyfriend anymore because I don't even want to spend time without him while I could spend some with him since I love him so much You have rich fantasies  have you thought of wrighting novels  It can help because it is not just talking   It is focusing on thoughts and how they affect how you behave and how you feel   It is kind of like investigating a puzzle and then figuring out the best way to put it together Call the local animal welfare charity and ask them for advice on how to take care of him    Side note   That  is the face    of a man who  truly  regrets his actions  Bite the bullet and admit you took the safest possible option considering the circumstances  Apologize for going against their wishes  as well  They're your parents and they likely won't believe any bullshit story your nervous 18 year old brain can come up with You really need to stand your ground   I think just the fact that it's not your property  is enough to warrant it being a bad idea   I would reply with you thought you married an adult  rather than someone willing to make stupid decisions just for some fun   Obviously not  since your genes were passed on to you You could contact the dojo and speak to them about this  they can give you advice   Or email them with questions  shut the duck up  What did the duck ever do to you I'm really happy for you  Congrats on the year long relationship  heres hoping for many more with her These are good questions for your doctor   If you don't have one  maybe go to a clinic and get a referral for a general practitioner   They can help you figure things out  maybe it is physical  maybe not  and refer you to a specialist if you need Interesting how the worthless people can end up with a balanced and fulfilling life    It's like if putting bacteria count as your first measure of satisfaction was not a very good strategy   And how do you deal with all the bacteria in your guts  Quite disgusting really I'm sorry about your situation  It's a very difficult one to navigate  The most important aspect in dealing with it  however  is rapport and being non judgmental  Being non judgmental doesn't mean letting her walk over you  though   How old is your sister  If she's at about high school age  gr 10 12   I think it's definitely possible to gain trust by having a friendly conversation about her views and also getting her to understand nuance better  Make sure she knows you love her   Help her use her own words and thoughts to better understand the factors underlying what she believes  Afterwards  it may be helpful to direct her to better sources than her friend  such as the  Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy  https   plato stanford edu    As a search engine  it's very accessible  Based on what you two end up discussing  you might have some key words to suggest Ages would help Transwoman here  Came out at 16  never looked back   Life may be hard after  Make sure you are safe  Much love  and I'm always here if needed  I send some hate messages to the guy last year  blew some steam  although im not angry on myself anymore  i am still very much angry on the guy   Five years ago  you threatened someone  and they kicked your ass  and you threaten them again a year ago   You created the first situation  and didn't learn anything    because i didnt revenge a beating with a beating   What makes you so sure you wouldn't get your ass kicked a second time  and by the same individual   Since you started the situation  you deserved the first beating  and since you are trying to instigate another situation  you would fully deserve a second one    Now my advice need is  should i confront him phisically  He was twice my size back then  it's more balanced now    He will defeat you again   And again  and again  and again   He has the confidence of having succeeded once before  and with each successive win  he will gain even more confidence  and you will lose more confidence  And this is how it should be  since you are starting this   You need to grow up and act like an adult   It isn't very mature to contantly go around  trying to instigate fights There are two kinds of cheating  unplanned  and deliberate deceptive     Unplanned cheating is a scenario like meet someone at a party  hit it off  get too drunk  do something you otherwise wouldn't and regret it the next day   While I think this is really shitty  if you don't have enough self control to stay true to someone  you shouldn't promise to stay true to them  it's understandable for a partner to forgive this as a one time event     What you have is not an accident or a one time event   It is an intentional  planned  continuous pattern of deception   Your boyfriend was lying to you every time he promised to stay monogamous  and was dishonest every time he talked to you because he was falsely representing himself and his commitment to the relationship    IMHO  if you can't trust his word on such an important thing  you can't trust his word on anything else either   So unless you want to be with someone that is literally 100  untrustworthy  I think you should leave this relationship and find someone better     Finally  you say you love him  and that's a powerful thing   But  and this may be the most painful but also most important thing to realize  the person you love may not exist  and may never have existed   You love a concept of this person  but that concept probably also includes honesty and integrity   The persona you love  loves you back   The persona you love would not intentionally deceive you or lie to you    However the person you've got is dishonest and has little integrity  he has continually deceived you and lied to you and apparently considers this to be an acceptable way to conduct the relationship with you    Therefore I argue that  by a certain interpretation at least  the person you love doesn't actually exist  he was an illusion created by the person you've got   It will take time to mourn the loss of this  and that's okay   But it's important that you do so  because otherwise you will just be continually deceived and lied to for as long as the relationship continues   Feels like I'm reading my own thoughts  12 24 pm here  and still nothing Me 17 M  Gf  17  Guy 17 18 not sureI'm OG hood but all 'da hood' is for me is a collection of terraced houses and I've lived in worse   We had the odd SJW saunter in dictate then fuck off back to their palatial homes in suburbia   Weren't called SJW's back then they were urban facilitators on 40k a year   You can hit them with reality if you like   for instance one 'urban facilitator' called round in a brand new VW Golf GTi somebody broke in and stole their car stereo a blaupunkt  they got their stereo back and the thief was given a tickle party down an alleyway   They tickled the bejasus out of him  by tickled I mean kicked they fuck out of him   You let these self righteous cunts see the reality of a life they couldn't hack you'll  see the back of them soon enough What book is thisThe OP was written as "look how there is nothing we can do"  as if it was an account of a typical difficulty of a paraplegic in every day life  But ended up "look how much I am a smug asshole thinking I am some sort of superior Asperger  while I am just an asshole "  This post shines a bit of light on why some "normie" tend by default not to make much effort to deal with people socially awkward  All of your friends say Hi Ask in  r personalfinancePay for actual driving lessons Lmfao  Oh sorry man that is so shitty  I don't even PVP in Dark Souls that much anymore because online is basically dead   Leveling to such a high level as me takes an extraordinary amount of grinding and knowledge of the finest locations of soul farming  Considering this all seems premeditated  you are acting like someone with a PD  and they would discharge you the second they could  Look up narcissistic PD and antisocial PD Man  right now since I am on break I am having the same sleep cycle   o  Yeah  that makes sense  Yeah that sounds like someone was playing a prank on you  Why would she send you nudes but then say you aren't attractive I know what you mean  Even if you can't be with them  it's a sweet  sweet pain  Honestly  if those 2 are what you're looking at for a differential diagnosis  I doubt that it would be accurate  They have very little in common and manifest COMPLETELY differently  They're also the two most self mis diagnosed disorders out there  I did  I love post apocalyptic fiction  In particular  the types that expose the darkest and grim aspects of human nature  Walking Dead  Dies The Fire  The Colors of Chaos  etc   The backstab one another for personal gain kind of plot  Or depictions of a brutal future   I have trouble finding this movie  but it was made in Australia  It tells the same story as me  And the title is called "Chink"  Five letters  I want to see it   Whoa  I commented before reading this  This sounds like legit PTSD  See an MD and get into some therapy right away  it's important to deal with it early before you develop 'coping skills' that ultimately make you worse off  PTSD is best treated with combo of meds and therapy  however  the meds need not be long term in many people  Good luck my friend It sounds like it is shot  and time to get a new one   Small appliances and kitchen gadgets like that sell for so cheap that it is unlikely that anyone would even work on it to fix it No  no it's not lopsided  If I recall correctly  it's 50 50 nowadays  It's just that the games YOU play have more men   women flock towards other games  games you probably would never touch  Usually any life simulation or otome game only have female players  same situation  except i was the one who got pregnant  you guys might stay together  or not  but your child will become a blessing at some point  maybe you don´t see it now  i def didn´t  but you´ll realize it soon enough  make sure you guys talk about how you want to raise the baby if that´s important to you and try your best to plan your futures  also understand that even if you don´t stay with your gf  she will always be the mother of your child  you´re stuck with her forever  so try to not let things get nasty even if you guys break up  at least for the kid´s sake  people do this all the time  have accidental babies and still succeed  and especially if you have help from your parents don´t let it go to waste  both you and your gf need to remember to follow your dreams bc or else you will resent yourself  the baby and each other for your failures  every decision you make affects not only you anymore  so make them well  and good luck There's tons of literature out there  but you want to associate your physiological response in a way that benefits you  Gradual exposure can be the best for severe anxiety  yet if you feel yourself getting nervous  it's time to backtrack and calm down your body's response  The more you associated a HR of 160 with a certain situation

and I've never ever seen them eat a toy   They may eat plastic that smells like food but even then most of them Not  You're worrying about absolutely nothing in that respect   Also   Idk how toys affect the growing of herbs   You should just communicate with the parents   Drop the bucket of toys off at their door with a note  saying that the kids are losing toys through the cracks and perhaps a rug or play mat would solve the issue   This sounds troubling  I do hope you change what you can  and move on  Hope you had a good night as well People name their houses Well welcome to this sub Report to whatever authority is there The people before hand did  and you can't change it back to numbersAre you sure you cant qualify me for psychopath  And which ones are "incurable"  No pills for relief or a cure  Otherwise I get the boot    I have contemplated that I may be antisocial  My dumbassed family thinks I have Borderline PD    I should start writing novels about myself  This isnt the first time that I got suggested to write a book  Even since high school  people wanted me to write books  I have the same problem  weed seems to be the only solution for me I saw this earlier today and it kind of ruined my day tbh attract her more than the other guy  that is the only way to influence someone to choose you We don't diagnose 'psychopath' in the DSM  it's considered antisocial PD  It basically means you'll do whatever you want to benefit yourself regardless of how it affects others in layman terms  Go visit any max security prison and you'll find the majority fit that criteria  Antisocial PD's do not go to psych hospitals  they go to jails The ultimate men   womens painless waxing experience whether your quest is to relax  boost your energy  improve your skin look younger

in a room full of people and feel alone any day This is the correct answer Look  man    just because you may not have achieved any of the standard "achievements" that society tries to force down your throat  doesn't mean that you have accomplished  nothing    Take stock  give yourself credit for what you have done   Don't worry about the shit you haven't done  Not everyone is cut out to live up to "standards"     "Standards" aren't really standard  you know   Just like common sense isn't really all that common   And if not this  then take the job for less hours and more pay and use that extra free time to better yourself to earn even more if you think you can go ahead  but for me to fix my sleep schedule i just take a nap around a good time to sleep so like take a nape round 10 later today and do that every day until one day i sleep all night  sounds weird but it works for me http   friends com definition of friendshipI'm glad somebody asked  I was lost from the word go What do you pay

awesome  Now call Animal ControlIf the majority of people here in America were like your dad our country would definitely be a lot betterEven your story is boring    id rather watch my granny count stamp   How about you stop giving a fuck and make choices you will regret the next day     Hell I got a hug and cheek kiss from some drunk stranger   Idk what you're going to pick up from this and damn my hands are tired from all this typing  1  You should try video games out  have you played the last of us   missing out  2  Fuck whoever said that because there are so many different types of girls into different types of guys  No person is the same  although we have a pletra of pathetic basic minded individuals in most communities  3  Ehh young girls are creeped out by public boners so whatever dude 4  The beauty of this is that those girls were never worth your time  I sure as hell wouldn't want a girl who would shun a nice guy just because she wasn't into him   5  Fuck those bitches  keep on talking to people  yea it will hurt sometimes but you'll hit succession some where I know it and if you don't then it's better you tried your best than to ponder on "what ifs"  6  Again fuck those people  7   Pray at church instead of being so conscious of the females around you   I think being so conscious about what other people think is a huge problem  Seriously just stop giving a fuck man  in middle school I got bullied because I have Hyper hidrosis  my hands got sweaty AF  and so many people called me out on it and I really let it bring me down and it made me awkward around people I didn't know  Now though I make fun of it and don't give a flying fuck and people see I don't give a flying fuck about what they think about it either   8   I never liked clubs and always felt out of place there  shit will always feel awkward if you go to the club with a iq above 100   9  That's just how it goes sometimes but it happens to the best of us  10  Ew people like that are pathetic af  I can't stand people who just wanna be with the cool crowd  Shows a lack of individuality and character    you got lucky you lose nothing from losing that girl I guarantee it   11   Just by her reaction    again if you were a guy that she was totally into  would you really want to date her   A girl who reacts like that  Idk I like my woman kind   12  STOP CARING ABOUT WHAT OTHERS THINK 13   Scumbags man  I wish to god I had the opportunity to beat the ass of dicks like that   14  Remember it's YOUR troupe  YOU own that shit  15  Feels like shit right  Seeing the girl you like get with a prick  You're not alone because allot of us has seen this  You know what i say  On to the next one  16  I also had social anxiety and what I did was start not giving a single damn about what other thought nor think about what people think of me and my life has gotten 500 times better  There is prescription out there for social anxiety that you can get through your doctor if you push hard enough but that's up to you  17  Sorry but your moms a bitch  get away from toxic people  family or not    18  Keep on following your fucking dreams because this shit is supposed to be hard and your supposed to stumble and your supposed to fall on your face  You'll get up and fall again but at the end of the day if you keep going and trying then I think you'll make it bud  I did terrible in high school and everyone thought that I was going to be worthless and now I'm on my way to becoming a doctor at a top tier medical school    so yea work hard and you will be rewarded  19  Please stop this because it's gonna make you feel worse and just make your own online profile  I can guarantee if you keep doing this YOU WILL feel worse  20  Might be hard to believe but I'd care if you died and I'm others would too  If you're fat then start hitting the gym  If you believe that you are ugly then no biggie because ugly is subject to opinion and everyone has a different opinion  With enough practice you could pick up any girl    I see one of my less attractive friend pick up stunning woman and how did he do it   Simple pick up lmao  Your girl will come around just watch   Apologies for the terrible grammar     rush game was strong Exact finances aside   Ask yourself the following questions    How much more dangerous is it  Without knowing exactly what it is you're doing  it's difficult to say whether or not it's worthwhile   How likely are you to get a promotion   pay raise in your new job    How likely are you to find another job offer    Which job is full time   permanent     Would the people who've offered you the job  negotiate on their opening salary    If you dislike your current job and finding another one is going to be slim pickings  I'd think about taking the new job  If it's highly likely that you'll get another offer  then I'd opt for waiting for another offer that's offering better conditions and pay What this sounds like is possibly he is suffering from self esteem issues  Possibly he's rejecting sex because he doesn't feel like he's good enough for it  or he feels embarrassed naked right now  It sounds weird  I know  but self esteem can do all sorts of shit to a person  How long has he been like this   This could also be stress related  Perhaps he's just worried about money or his security  Stuff like that can make someone feel too anxious to get down   Best way to know is just ask him about it  Try not to be in a nagging way  but just that you wanted to know if something was troubling him  Either way  it sounds like there's something making him nervous  And for only 5 cents an hour    I actually thought I was going to have something to do this year  but the person cancelled on me so I spent the day alone again Meaning  Thank you for the reply  yes that does make more sense  I suppose I was nurturing a small hope of getting back together with her as well  I guess I was wrong  Cod liver oil I know how you feel  It's not always easy being the one that's always there for everyone else  But for what it worth we're here for you  Even if we never meet just remember that there's always a few people here who understand  relate  and want to be here for you  You owe that money  period  Pay it back  Pretty sure it's illegal to live in your car in most places as well       Have you not considered trying to convince the landlord not to evict  The notice isn't the end of the story if you act fast enoughBe proud to be seen as trailer trash  I've been with women who thought I could do better   Yeah I'm with you sooo your problem is  People with a low opinion of you or your family ask them if I'm so shit then why the fuck is your superior being of a son daughter with me  Take this with a pinch of salt  but I've personally been trying to change this about myself too and this seemed to work for me  just got to practice  We all did it as kids  Make faces in the mirror  Making faces in the mirror will help you get accustomed to the facial expressions that you can make and maybe even help you get familiar with new ones    I started like this  When doing your morning routine  just take a minute and analyze yourself with a resting face and be mindful of any emotion that you are feeling  Could be anger  tiredness  happy sad  anything   Take that feeling and try expressing it on your face   Play around with it  go subtle  then exaggerate  You might surprise yourself with expressions that you thought you couldn't make  Get comfortable with you  then try to express that with others  Have fun with it  make it a game  I hope that helps at all  good luck and happy new year    I agree with your posted definition    Friendship can mean different things to different people  take a video of yourself tying your shoes and post it   maybe you're doing something different than most people Youre more attractive than you thought  Congratulations   Also  there isnt anything called standards  Thats great  but what same happened to me last week except      I didnt lose my virginity    I'm sixteen    She didnt want any relationship at all   but I'm happy for youEhhh  I'm pretty sure those statistics include girls who casually play games on Facebook and on their phone when they have literally nothing else to do  I guess you could argue that they are "gamers " but personally I wouldn't count anyone that casually plays games only because they have nothing else to do at that time a "gamer "     otome game only have female players  Well yeah  otome games are visual novels for females  I would imagine that there aren't many guys who play otome games  but I bet there are as many if not more guys playing the opposite version though No  I really am not great  I know this for a fact I mean  we can't judge your situation  Ethics isn't clear cut  You should pay her  it's the right thing to do  but it sounds like you'll be homeless if you do  What's the question  P S  Let me know if you do try it and if you get any results  I REALLY hope you do message Ausgekugelt and consider taking his advice  It's sound  You're stronger than you know and you do seriously deserve better than this  Once this is all over and you're free of this vicious cycle you will have a clearer perspective of how poisonous this relationship is  Feel free to message me if you want someone non judgemental to talk to  I'm on Reddit at least once a day and I will respond quickly     Best of luck  This post sounds unhelpful Perhaps if you were to give us an idea about anything about it   Country  what the area is known for  what the house's old name was  and so on   Features of the house   I live in an area where there are a lot of ranches that have names  but the houses itself never do I sent her a text earlier in the day after he cut someone off but she isn't comfortable with confrontation  I'm not sure if this is going to play out any further at this point  but I'd much rather not go on a trip in an area like this with him in the future if he's driving   r 2meirl4meirl  You ain't alone buddyOh my gosh  You and Burt are the best   But yeah  you 100  do not have bird flu  or cat AIDS yaaaaay    Just call around for bird friendly vets in your area then stop by with Burt as soon as they'll see you   Then have an awesome life with your new tiny bro Hi   I recognized myself a lot in what you wrote  What helped me tremendously   making friends through shared hobbies  I know 4 people always happy to play tabletop games  another 3 always ready for video games  2 co workers with whom I can talk recipes and cooking stuff in depth  3 people to go rock climbing with  etc  It makes socializing painless because we are doing something we enjoy  and shared experiences are very nice to have    I usually shot down invitations to 'just hang out'  no shared activity  until we grow so close that I actually enjoy to do so You can ask your ISP telephone provider to increase the gain on the line  you can get a repeater also   Repeaters ain't cheap   It's been years since I've had to deal with networking and I fuckin hate it  boo hoo I've to set up a new network for myself next week   But ask your sip telephone company increase the gain first before you start pissing about with repeaters n shit Dude   i threathen him after the fight  He grabbed me from a beer line and punched me before ive had the chance to understand whats happening And your mentality that someone can beat you up because they did it before is very unbased on anything  Thank you for your advice anyway Landlord found out about the dogsI'm kind of confused as to what "problem" you would like addressed hsr  You say you have yellow fever and prefer asian women  That's ok  we all have personal preferences and exclusivities  Then you say you idolize women  and that you would like to learn to "love" women  Sorry you're getting downvoted but your message is just getting losr  care to elaborate  That's awesome dude  Hope you got a lot more for new years  Next step  get one erryday Yeah man  As someone who is done with school and has no friends either  I agree with and relate to everything you just said     so where does that leave the social outliers who weren't that great at making friends in their earlier years  what are they supposed to do   die aloneThe way to best come across to anyone is to leave color out of it  period  Not only can it inflame the SJW  it is just plain unnecessary  Your sister is with a bad influence and the best thing you can do is be a good role model    Let her know you love her and you're concerned that her friend doesn't respect her body enough and may not understand how badly a good education is necessary for your sister in your family's circumstances  Tell her that you'll always support her and that you hope she'll make decisions that will be better for her   Then wait  It's all you can do  I hope you and your family can get this sorted out  We're all one race  the human race Is your friend Kayne West I understand that  but perhaps you can negotiate with the landlord to avoid eviction  Dogs will leave or something    Well  we're on the way there anyway    He's mentioned it  and if that's what we need to do to get his green card  it's fine  We've been together nearly two years at this point so in the next few years we would anyway  I'm hoping we won't have to for his green card  but nbd either way I've approached a few girls at a mall  It went better than i originally expected  but I haven't done any shit like that since  this was around 3 weeks ago  because i don't know      Shit is fucking hard  there is definitely some awkwardness  and I can't see how doing this ends up getting me a girlfriend   Before you ask how it went  out of the 5 girls i went up to  3 was just awkward as fuck because i clammed up and didn't know what to say and then i just left  the other 2 i managed to be normal and they were nice and smiley and both added me on facebook  where all manner of conversation fizzled out 2 days after    we did chat a little bit   One had a bf anyway   For the first 5 times I've ever done it it went pretty good  Actually now I kind of want to do it again  i just don't really know like what's the goal here or I don't see like    idk I've always just wanted a gf to love  IDK how viable this is to getting there  I'm turning 25 in a few months  still KV Here's to optimism  You can do it     Here's to a fantastic 2017FA is not a pissing contest Ok   The way your backstory read  it sounded as if you had instigated the first fight   You are definitely trying to instigate a second fight  and this you are doing  after everything is said and done for    And your mentality that someone can beat you up because they did it before is very unbased on anything  Actually  it is based on something   When something has beat you before  it creates an anxiety within you  that contributes to you losing in the face of that adversary a subsequent time   Even as you speak  do you not realize that this is something of a fixation for you   This has taken over your ability to go on and live life  and be happy in the here and now I hope you managed to have a happy new year   I struggle with anxiety and depression too  They truly are awful  I over analyse things and take things personally  and I hurt very deeply  In my 30 years on this earth  I've found there are no quick fixes  and they aren't always a bad thing  Hurting is a sign or caring and compassion  of being invested in something  I've made a list for myself of things to do when I feel this way   going for a walk  reading a book  a cup of tea  listening to music  writing in my journal  Self care is important for everybody  and especially so for those of us who feel so intently   I wish you peace for 2017   You need therapy not revenge    You have been petty in bringing it up with him  he's apologised  Why would kicking his ass help anything  What if he beat you up again in self defence I can't say I completely understand your reference  yet I'm still laughing  Gonna be another lonely year for me then   Thinking  What kinds of things do you think about people  In what kinds of situations do you think these things  What kinds of people make you think these things  What do they do   What do you do that looks mean  What is it about what you do that makes it look mean To lead an authentic life  For years I've worn a mask to make other people comfortable  The disingenuity made me feel hollow  so I've decided to just roll with it and be myself  I opened up to my Facebook friends about being mentally ill  so I'm off to a good start  I think i've expressed myself badly  I didn't cause anything  i can't remember to ever start a fight  i threatened him after the beating  he grabbed me from a beer line and punched me in the face before i had the chance to underdtand whats happeningThe Damned  The Veil  Housebound  horror comedy   They're Watching  The Haunting in Connecticut     soo manyI think it's clear that you are harbouring some serious issues if after 5 years you are still wanting to do something to HIM about it  You should do something to YOU about it because it's not healthy to hold on to this for so long  especially after he apologised   I was randomly beat up in a park on a Summer day when I was 16   I'm 31 now and I don't want to do something to the people who did that to me  They were just drunk assholes  I didn't get an apology  How long can you harbour this ill will for before you accept that it is damaging you to do so Thank you everyone for your kind words   Glad to read that you are safe    Your mother sounds exactly like mine  My mother is vindictive and nasty  and horribly insecure  I can't cut her out of my life either  unfortunately  But as I've grown older  I'm 30   I've put boundaries in place with her  If she rings and berates me  I hang up  If we go out somewhere and she calls me names  I get up and leave  I cannot change her behaviour  but I can control how I respond  As someone above said  if you wouldn't tolerate that treatment in an intimate relationship  you don't have to tolerate it because you share DNA    Take care of yourself xoxHang in there chickadee   I realise i have a big fixation on this  that's why i brought it up  It used to keep me from living life altogether  made me hate myself and think  I'm a coward bla bla  For that stuff that i overcame  and not base myself on the ego to know who I am  I am actually thankful I got the beating  But my problem is I still hate him deeply  I shook almost everything else off  I've created flowers out of mold  crystals from the pressure inside of me  BUT my hatred for him still staies  also my way with girls is not how i wanted it to be  i felt humiliated in from of the girl whom I considered of my dreams  and I struggle to  understand that any girl takes me for serious snymore  even though they might do  i think this fear alone attracts the very thing I don't wish   to not be taken for realIt's maaaany hurdles but like the other guy above me said  Get out of the comfort zone  It can be big but no need to make things large amd scary  Start small  It could be the smallest thing that you'd want to get over but the most important part is just starting somewhere and keep going  Most people see this huge mountain and faint evn before stepping onto it  Giving yourself attainable short term goals that give you positivity and VICTORIES are what you need    For example it could be that stranger that you sometimes make eye contact with at school  Show a smile  Say hi  You didn't talk to anyone for the break  That's ok  when school starts you could make it a point to tell any person one thing you did over the break  You noticed that your body language might be offputting  but you have great eyes  That could be a starting point too  If you're not sure how to even start  observe others that are naturally inviting with it  compare and contrast the two then try copying it  Your starting point can be anything  they are all relevant skills that need to be practiced anyhow  As you garner more experience and of course enevitable  stumble along the way  you will learn  and grow grow grow  I hope that helps at all and have  a Happy New Year  Are you intimidated by said guy That does explain a lot   I've removed your post   We don't allow fundraising in here  and I've removed sadder causes than this in the past   Since we don't have a registration and verification process in here  it leaves the subscriber susceptible to scams   Also  I am going to ask that you read our rules  and understand that you will be banned on your next rule break   Rules are linked at the top of our sidebar First off  don't listen to people who tell you that your high school years should be the best years of your life  It may have been for them  but that doesn't mean that you're obligated to feel the same way    Try branching out if you've got the time  Does your school have any after school clubs  Is there a sport you've always wanted to try out  Meeting new people can be hard  but it gets easier every time    I don't know  I know it's very bad for me  I wish to be free of this limiting issue  but for real  not pretend to be so  because that way it will still be affecting my judging in a more or less way but it will still be there  snd I will only be in denial Deepen the relationships that I care about  and eventually naturally smile at every person i make eye contact with  So its in the uk  in the area most known for robin hood  it's an old house and was called dorngale Ok   Since this seems to be rooted in wanting help to get back into relationships  I need to remove this  and am going to ask that you read our rules   But I would say to talk to a counselor   They can help you past this What the hell  no one answered your question  How worthless are you people   Colleges don't look at individual grades just credit hours  They'll see you have higher than a 2 5 gpa then will look at what classes you passed  transfer those credits in and either start you as a junior or make you take the requirements for that specific major   I left community college with a 1 7 gpa in 2002  then went back and finished with a 3 8 in 2014  When I took my credits to a 4 year college they never cared what my original gpa was just the classes I passed   Fyi  grades and gpa means nothing in the real world  just as long as you have proof of you passing  Have you looked into what it would cost to test  I ask because I originally didn't get tested for the same reason  I have a family history  but my relatives with cancer were already deceased by the time I discovered the test and I didn't think it would be affordable  Often insurance companies will cover it if you have a strong family history and it turned out to be not that expensive  Even if you think you might have one  testing to see which BRCA gene  1 or 2  is mutated can be helpful    Best of luck with your decision  Dealing with the family aspect of that was really frustrating for me  especially on top of finding out about the genes and statistics   I'm in sort of the same situation  I work from 3 9pm so I've been sleeping in a lot    I think the main issue would be relationship wise  You might be awake when the people around you are asleep  and asleep when they're awake  Just try to make sure you aren't too isolated  I think it's a bit obvious that I've felt that way  But just be yourself  Unless you're a complete prick  But seriously though  I connected with her by being myself and not trying to pretend to be someone else  Try meeting girls through friends  That will probably work the best I don't know  but you could invest in Darn Tough socks  They have a lifetime warranty so when they get damaged you return them  r buyitforlife swears by them  Yes she knew  she kinda "took the lead" and quietly told me how to do things or what she wanted  The only things I knew how to do were because I read them on Reddit  I lasted pretty long  But I guess that's what you get for wanking it all that time  Thankyou I've been the same way  All my friends around me were way more socially and sexually active  Don't let it get to you  Just do what you enjoy  You'll meet someone eventually   Make contact with old school friends on facebook and ask to meet up  what do you do when you meet up In some ways it gets easier   but in other ways it gets harder   The nice thing about getting older is that age isn't really a factor in who could become a friend   For me this happened in my early 20s  making friends who were 6 8 years older than me  and it continued in my late 20s  making friends who were in their 30s or 40s   The number of people you can potentially be friends with is HUGE as you get older   This is great if you have obscure hobbies or interests  As an example   my SO was in his late 20s when he became friends with a man in his 70s  I kid you not   They enjoy talking about similar things so it's been a meaningful friendship over the years   Another benefit of getting older  in my experience   is that you start to appreciate people who you wouldn't have appreciated when you were younger   I'm embarrassed to say that there were a few kids I went to high school with whom I didn't bother to get to know because I thought they were weird  I talked with them at our 10 year reunion and they were so cool  Now that I'm older I see their eccentricities as positive   not negative  My experience at work has been similar   we have the same mixture is types of people you would have in a high school  jocks  nerds   etc    but despite our differences   we all get along well   work well together   and most importantly   care about each other and enjoy each other's company   Now for the bad  it can be challenging to meet new people as an adult  You're not enrolling in a new class with new peers every semester  You don't have opportunities to bond with others over difficult homework assignments   All in all   it gets better   Hang in there  I would never go back to be a teen again  Seriously   it's tough   but growing up takes a lot of the problems away can you tell me an example I'm not sure what kind of potential troubles you are talking about  4chan is just a bloody website  They might keep you blocked forever  and I think that's about the worst which could possibly happen  Or I don't quite understand what you are asking She's on birth control  I didn't have any  if you hadn't even had your first kiss until 19  packing condoms isn't really something you think about   Yes I know I've been incredibly stupid and that condoms aren't only for preventing pregnancy  But in the heat of the moment  I couldn't be bothered and just wanted to experience it  Next time I'm definitely wearing one though  I think that class schedule sounds like a good fit for your current sleep schedule  BUT   I would really encourage you to do what it takes now to get on a more "normal" sleep schedule  The vast majority of jobs for college graduates expect you to be there during normal work hours  You are going to have an extremely difficult time performing well at work  or even keeping your job  after you graduate if you are accustomed to your current schedule  It might take some time to change it and get used to it  so better to start now Maybe you can ask people whose interests lie in that area   I don't know the first thing about it  and couldn't even make an intelligent suggestion     I thought I made it clear that making out led into sex  but maybe I could've worded it better There are some definite similarities between the two stories  I hope you find closure on it all soon  There are many possible reasons    Are you walking in socks  without shoes  a lot  On stone floor  Are your shoes loose  Do you frequently have sand in your shoes  Are the socks very cheap I tend to make friends slowly  maybe meeting only 1 good friend every few years  But over time it adds up  Here's where my current friends are from  1 from middle school  1 from high school  2 from college  although I'm only close with one of them   1 from grad school  2 from work  1 from an extracurricular activity  1 from another extracurricular activity  etc  Along the way I've met many other people who I enjoyed spending time with and I would have considered them my friends at that time in my life  but in terms of genuine  lasting friendships  I've accumulated those slowly  And that's ok  Quality over quantity I tried learning an instrument but didn't have the willpower to practice a lot   I just wanted to learn to play guitar because I thought I'd have fun playing once I knew some stuff but the only thing I could do was simple exercises over and over People who play games are gamers   just because you have your own personal definition of what a 'gamer' is  casual games don't count 11  11   doesn't mean that women don't play games   Otome games aren't visual novels  A lot of otome games  are  visual novels  but otome games are just games directed towards women  yeah  there was such little content for women that they had to invent a word for games geared towards women   which can be anything   But basically  my point   plenty of gamer girls exist  Gamer girls who are into the same games as  you  are  are probably very few  Much like how there's very few guys who are into otome games NO NO NO NO NO  Stable  grown men do not do this  Although right now it's JUST emailing to get to know each other  and next it'll JUST be lunch  all those JUSTs start to build up and next thing you know it it was JUST a kiss  He's a creep  RUN NOW Good luck If you are interested at all  you're gonna have to try and find out I guess    I don't think there's another wayMaybe a body pillow  Seems like your issue is becoming a her issue    which it shouldn't  I just wanted to add that I also have the same issue  I'm still only young  but I should have had my license 5 years ago    I just can't do it  attempting to drive even an automatic car leads to almost immediate panicking and crying  I just know that I can't trust any other drivers to actually follow the road rules  and I have to watch absolutely everything and everyone because of it  My high sensitivity and tendency for overstimulation doesn't help  nor does my poor spatial sense   It feels horrible since everyone I know can drive with no issues  but I feel like I have less autonomy and freedom since I'm either at their mercy or the mercy of public transport  I'm planning on moving to a large European city where having a car would be a major hassle  since then it'd hopefully be easier to blend in and I wouldn't feel like such an embarrassment   But on the plus side  cars are exceptionally expensive with insurance  repairs  petrol  fines  and parking to pay for  You probably save money by not having one  If countries ever ban cars or hike prices of petrol because of climate change  then you'll be in a good position since you're already used to not having a car  I just wish it wasn't so 'normal' to drive You can actually greet New Year to stranger in street parks  I'm sure they won't get angry with you Yeah you were  I wish you good graces as wellMy point is that under the same conditions both hemp flax oil and fish oil are both equally likely to spoil     I prefer fish oil among other animal products high in epa  dha  for various reasons  but mostly for the poor conversion rate of short chain omega 3 fatty acids ie ala  to long chain omega 3fatty acids  epa dha   I'd like to add that she should change her locks  There is a chance he has a spare key somewhere  do not let him have that opportunity How about you pay her back Here's to hope she's being honest with you and that she didn't give you an STDThis is the funniest thing I've read all year    Don't bring it up  you'll just make it awkward between you  Even if he did notice  if you act like nothing happens  he'll likely forget about it soon I work in Los Angeles and work closely with AC and C And they're not going to do anything to help the bird   Also  it's i against LA Municipal Code to handle and feed pigeons so you could catch a ticket for taking the bird Your boss wants to be in that porn with you I think we're supposed to question his judgement I have a very large age gap with my girlfriend  however both of us knew what we wanted before we even met    The chances of him just wanting friendship are not high  but you never know for certain What about "talk to strangers" I don't know why but I never gain much weight  I eat all I can but still I am skinny   Yeah like I said they're single  Because one is overweight and the other idk what's up  Some times it's just like that if you're a guy or girl    Can't you set up a gaming society at college You're all adults of drinking age  Part of being an adult is taking responsibility for your actions    The two girls who got too drunk pay the rides  The girl who threw up pays the cleaning fee  You and Cindy don't pay anything   Cindy's idea to help paying is noble  but dumb and unfair  It's you and her who already went out of your way to care for the others as is  It's Ashley's job to offer paying you back  no matter what she's going through  Having "a difficult time"  that she might have gotten herself into as well   is no justification to create a mess and expect others to deal with it    I'd suggest allowing Ashley a day to recover and to contact you on her own  In case she doesn't  remind her of what happened and that you'd appreciate it if she paid you back  Be friendly  but firm  If she can't pay right now  she can suggest an alternative  Also  I'd spare her the embarrassment of letting her know that she's having a tough time   unless you don't see any other alternative    i just don't really know like what's the goal here  Either an instant date or to set up plans for a future date and or exchange numbers  This is good for health  go to my link   get a good health Even some FAs think money doesn't make a difference but when you don't have any it really is limiting Then perhaps he isn't the man you should be with  The choice is yours though  but his behaviour will continue  Sherwood Woods  The Hoods Hood  No worries  OK soo out of all of that your crew said you were doing really well   I'd take what your mum said with a grain of salt unless she's been talking directly with your supervisors she might just be projecting her concerns frustrations     Does your mum know the full extent of the situation as well has she or anyone else in the family ever had to deal with anxiety previously     How's the hunt for psychology councillors going   Oh wow the potential dream job sounds amazing    Definitely even more reason to try find someone who can help in terms of proper techniques etc as will def help your cause future   Would also maybe suggest your gf maybe seeks some extra support as well even if is just to help you get through some of the tougher times     Also yes def should try out yoga    Hope your new years went OKish otherwise   I don't know  I just said it to my mom one day because I thought the same thing  I realized much later that it hurt her feelings and made her sad  and she has no desire to divorce him at all  I was just projecting We work together through our issues  we're best friends but we may as well also be partners  P  I've tried a body pillow as well as other pillows and things  it's not about the feeling of someone next to me  I have also tried white noise machines  radios  asmr and various other things that might help with replacing that  In the end knowing that someone is there is always the easiest way for me to relax  Used to be the same for me  but in my case I had to start eating a lot of smaller meals inbetween the larger meals  I easily ate a big breakfast  pizza for lunch  mcdonalds for dinner etc and never put on a single kg  When I started lifting last year I forced myself to get some oatmeal  protein shakes  sandwiches  pasta you name it  several times a day inbetween meals  I'm not gonna lie it haven't gotten easier  it's a real chore to force myself to eat constantly but it's the only way I gain weight  But before you do any of that thought  just eat like you do on a regular day and get a proper calorie count  you might be eating way less than you think you are I always joke to people when they ask what my new years resolution is  I always say hopefully passing in my sleep   people laugh  but its true lmao I wouldn't worry about the cat  it might chew the toys but they're generally smart enough not to eat them     Hold onto the toys longer then eventually the kids will regret doing them down and learn to stop doing that    Or  tell them to get a designated bucket with a rope they can lower down that you will agree to put the toys into Then the toys will be stuck between the wood beams and the screen   The screen needs to be on the top  Hey  They don't need a written  to fire you since you "quit"  Walking off the job without notice or warning meansigns you areally quitting  You didn't get terminated    so you are not eligible for entitlement or even unemployment   After your 3 day no show  a walk off was probably the last straw as they see that you decided to not to work    If you got any questions  I am around to answer Wow what assholes  They could have gotten themselves or other innocent people killed  Why are you hanging out with these immature jerk faces  They certainly don't seem like they respect you  I've taken many many different antidepressants over the years  most of the SSRI's have caused some degree of appetite or sexual function change and these are well documented  but I'm not sure if they affected my cognition at any point beyond the issues that were already apparent because of the depression  However I have had two seperate courses of Mirtazapine which I'm fairly certain have caused aphasia  I often find it difficult to have a flowing conversation due to the fact that I often "lose words" to the point where I have to consider a career change Get your head out of your ass and buy her a ring  You had to convince her which means she wanted one  The ring is about her  not you  and doesn't have to be  10k Jesus christ  Honestly  Based on your selfies you look like a solid 8  Kinda looks like TZUYU or Park Boyoung depending on the pic  Not not attractive at all  I think you can and should be more confident about yourself    Edit  Also  get help if you're having suicidal thoughts  There are plenty of resources if you're living in Canada  I'm really glad that you're better now    I've honestly never had to deal with depression or any kind of mental illness myself or even financial problems so it just seems that she and I come from completely different worlds and that is only just dawning on me  It's taken a long time   I've always been very self preservative by just going "Oh you think you can just leave me out in the cold  Well I'll do it to you first " and I've been so afraid that that was what I was doing to her  you know ruining the oldest friendship I have at the moment    But I've come to the conclusion that this is the best for me and she will get over it  We need to take care of ourselves before taking care of everyone else  who said worthless people dont have fulfilling lives even athletes singers and jobless criminals have fulfilling livesSo basically you're hoping for an apocalypse to break the emasculating tedium of your current existence  so you can stick it to all the people that you don't like and become the asocial alpha that normal law wont allow Interested in being funnier too  Could I have those resources too Either dont bring it up  or make it a  huge joke at your own expense  and don't give or let on you remember details  "How smashed was I last might  man  I had this vivid dream I was touching a dude " see how he reacts and respond accordingly  Either don't say anything else or be like  "yeah  it was so crazy vivid what if it was real  " and then start making jokes Yeah  exactly  Scrambling around trying to find a way to help sometimes just worsens the situation  ex I have a feeling that I'm just a stress factor to my friend    I'm really glad that you are better  Are you    Feeding eggs to a bird Update  it didn't go well this time  Oh well  this year's goal is to make at least 3 new   real   friends by improving my social skills  This is a very big goal   I'll treat yesterday like a starting point  and see what I'll be doing in 364 days in order to measure my progress   Isn't getting a bj suppose to make you cool  Oh man  props to your dad  If that were my daughter being attacked I would be a felon for sure  Anyways  my fiancé had a similar problem with an abusive piece of shit  She moved over to her grandparents for a while where we had a LDR for 2 years  then she moved back here after the majority of her shock subsided  I try to make everything as normal as possible for her  but she still has issues with it  Maybe moving somewhere else would help you as well  I'm sorry you had to go through this  People are really shitty That's exactly what most people do  but every now and then you click and the 10 min convo leads to numbers exchanged  It's probably hard to hear  but I doubt you're ready for a committed relationship  Which isn't a big deal since you're young  Either way  unchecked feelings lead to bigger problems  If you aren't that invested  I suggest breaking up before you are yeah i confronted her ans she admited to it  but she sidnt have sex with any one and she is really sorry for what happened  i tried breaking up with her but she doesnt let me  she is trying to prove she diserves me and she needs me  i dont know if ill stay  I can assure you he did not  God only does good No problem and yeah I assumed you were  Try to just let her go though for both of your sakes  How can I helpNo  Didn't have my first kiss until 21 and the only reason I had some condoms before then is my roommates gave me some as a joke  so definitely justifiable  Explains my life thenPfft  I had a lot of girls wish me a happy new year   My mom  my sister  my niece    Hey no problem man  Just keep your head up and remember that you have a whole life ahead of you  You're only a high school student   Good luck

last remaining Grandma to a really shit death  and her crap doctor didn't really help  he messed up her palliative drugs   I lost my job and I'm stuck on benefits again struggling to find work   Edit I did have a great time dating my  now ex  boyfriend for a while then that went south too  he broke up with me twice  then I ended it the third time  but I hope we can be friends   So not a great year for me either  Other things happened too    I hope you have a much better 2017  I hope the same for me and anyone reading this too  So the OP tells her how good looking she is A year's a long time  You never know It's so good to see this clean  You are lucky dude gal  Happy New Year   That's what I did  and ironically your comment was removed as well  I've only just approved it now that I was made mod   Good bye everyone  you all helped me so much and I wish the best on all of you     who the hell was that    every farewell thread everIn different ways yes and no   Yes   You don't get to pick where you go to high school and what kids you see every day  At high school you are basically locked into a general group of people with all different ambitions and lifestyles  As an adult you get to pick what career field you work in  where you live  and most importantly what hobbies adult you wants to do  This is where you meet people who are more like minded like you  As a kid you have a lot of friends  as you get older you end up making more close friends than friends in general   No    Unless you live on campus in college  join the military  or join some other career where you spend almost all of your day with people  you'll never be in a similar situation to meet friends again  In high school  things just aren't that serious  You go to school and talk to your friends and work comes along every now and again  Once you start working you will run into people with kids  old friends  family they have to see  etc  You will meet a lot of people who just want to get their work done so they can go home  You might be 20 years old and the next closest person to you at work is in their 30's   Basically what I'm trying to say is focus now and focus hard on your future  I'm not saying quit trying to make friends or anything but just decide what lifestyle YOU want to live  What job YOU want to do  Do you want to go to college   Until you answer these questions life might be hard  If you feel trapped in a place you don't like living  it can suck and demotivate you from doing anything socially  I had the burden of living somewhere I didn't want to live  When I finally realized it I told myself I would move to       in       months  My biggest regret was that I didn't decide sooner  If you're happy  other people will be attracted to you   PS  Most people I went to high school with have entirely different groups of friends now  They might see each other around the holidays but for the most part everybody has found new friends I'm sorry this is so old  Anyway she was in there for two weeks on the day before my boyfriend was able to pull her out  I've been caught in a thought circle  staring at a wall most of the time  I've stopped living my life and I'm terrified to put myself out in the world while I'm just this disaster  I have a huge problem communicating after having isolated for so long  School and work mixed with substance abuse and my mental health problems caused a lot of distress  I'm going to try to get clean again  Maybe that will clear my head up a littleIn Montreal  there's always a job in construction  That being said  Montréal

live in the south  It isn't a big deal here because everyone gets Ma'am ed and Sir ed all over the place regardless of age or position   I didn't realize til adulthood that it was considered rude or an indication of old age in other regions That sounds like it must've really made a difference  I'm definitely going to emulate this and hopefully regain some real sense of self  Were there points where you felt like giving up and things like that  or was it easy to keep in the swing of doing things  And nah  that doesn't sound weird at all  I've tried doing similar things  but I haven't done it often  I'll try more frequently cause it's nice to have that reassurance  even if it is from yourself Thanks I hope I will one day Hahaha that sound so awesome man  I'd like to do that noise with someone but got no one  What a shame  Lol  But you're right  if the world is unkind  don't add up to it and make it worse  I  myself  am a huge pushover  Its not like I have bullies  but when I meet mean  disgusting people  no matter how pissed I am  I just let it go  I figured  there's not much that I can get if I brawl with them as Im not that kind of person and brawling sound so much effort    Its nice to talk to nice people  Its just whats on mind right now    Pigeons are tasty  You need a few more for a decent pie though Well excellent  I guess I don't even need to try in 2017 Long story short  Whilst it is legitimate to be concerned for your sister  any matters of discipline and preventing her talking to someone are matters for your parents    not   you   tl dr  not your circus  not your monkeysWell I tried  This morning me and mom where talking about my life  As soon as a started getting too deep into the abuse she goes "Stop save that for your counselor"  If only I had the luxury of being able to stop thinking about it  They will never understand  I will die misunderstood with my life spread across 5 different counselors and 2 different websites  College in the netherlands isn't really a place for communities and stuff  It's just a place where you learn  The closest thing there is is a student organisation but most activities there are parties  2 things in conversation are focus and tempo   You correctly predict that it sounds massively condescending because of the focus  The amount of emphasis you put on it makes it seem like you are being deliberately condescending  if you make it a lighter and shorter "it sounds like you think  this   it is actually  this "   The next important part is tempo  people don't remember conversations or interactions  they just remember how they feel  so it is important to leave the conversation in a positive note always  After you give criticism  turn the conversation into something else  any other topic so that the whole general tempo of the conversation is not about the criticism I never did get around to reading Ender's Game  I'll grab a copy to read   In high school I knew about it but at the time I judged books by their cover rather harshly   http   www somesmart com wp content uploads badender jpg  It was a little too cheesy for me   p  I hear you on the moral gray area   I had a hard time playing those Telltale games when they first came out   Sometimes I would want to choose the violent paths but would end up going against my judgement and choose the safe path   Typically I do this in life as well   I'm not honest with myself and instead appease others   Most things I see are in black and white  but I'll work on reaching that gray outlook Happy New Year  buddy  I'm glad you're here  otherwise I might get bored  Take care of yourself  And for God's sake    take a goddamn shower     At least in the south it's mostly a sign of respect  As an older man I still say it to older and younger women to show them respect and courtesy  It may also be a reaction to your positive appearance  I hope you had the self respect not to fulfill their demands o that's terrible     hey man  i bet that despite all the shit that's gone on over the last 2 years  there were still moments where you became a better person  learnt new things and experienced all new emotions   whenever I look back at moments in the past and my life in general  I just think how despite all of those shitty moments  I learnt something from every single one of them  I've learnt how to be a more empathetic and caring person to others from how others have treated me like shit for example   I think times like these call for the most amount of reflection  and my favourite quote for times like these is 'if you hit rock bottom  stay there because that's when you learn the most' or something along those lines Definitely report it as inappropriate sexual harassment Indeed  I was pointing out how dumb you must be to  1  imagine for more than three seconds that there is a notion of "worth" for human beings and  2  that you could assess the said worth based on  what you see in 30min of  the job the said human being does to earn the necessary money to live his life   I suggest we stop here  you are too much of an idiot who thinks she he has figured it all And yet nobody seems to have thought "doing it" meant sex  Sigh Sounds like he likes you and wants a closer relationship with you but is incredibly shy  You'll probably be fine  but you should probably let someone in your house know  sarcasmMaybe

need to "run it by" you  You and this person are over  right  Why do you think you get a say in who either of them have sex with  And how do you know they aren't dating or in love  Why not be happy for them instead of being petty and losing two people you're close to funny how a woman started kissing everybody last night and before she finished with others I got away and hidden in my roomMaybe you can die fighting in the civil war That's awesome   But what makes you think he's incredibly shy "Yeah man  you bringing it up because you want to give me one too "  I live in the northeast and people rarely call me ma'am  I'm in my early 40s  and I figure that ma'am means they think I'm old  When I was in my 20s  I called a dude in his 40s sir  and he was offended Only 1 in 292 201 338 for the Powerball jackpot    Not bad LOL   r asablackman I can't say I like it but I also realize that there isn't much of an alternative     I'm long past the "Miss" stage and "Hey lady " seems a little wrong somehow       So I'm a "Ma'am "Yeah basically you're right  If you're attractive it really doesn't matter what your interests are Yes  You can tell your parents that you have something personal to ask the Dr  or you can even make the appointment yourself and go without their knowledge  Though that might be difficult depending on your age  There's also school counselors you can reach out to who can advocate for you to your parents  Any adult you are comfortable with can help you talk to them if you're you nervous  If they are good parents then they will want to know how you're feeling and want to help you  He wants to know more about you  he wants to be closer to you  he's interlocking fingers  this is an attempt at intimacy  But he he's having difficulty letting you know verbally that he likes you  Being that close to you and thinking about telling you makes him sweat from anxiety  He probably wants to ask you out or tell you he likes you or something but can't bring himself to do it  Aids I know a guy who within weeks of starting university got a girlfriend and they are still together after 6 years  I knew this guy quite well and he was no chad  a bit quiet and not particularly outgoing but had a face that girls would look for I guess   If you are wondering he is half asian and I don't know about you but I've yet to see an unattractive half asian  They seem to get the best of both worlds in terms of facial genetics lol  I guess his personality was a factor but I reckon his looks were what got her attention  at least initially Not sure where people come up with the idea that therapists have all of these severe clients with all of these devastating problems  but the truth is that the majority of clients are pretty middle of the road like you when it comes to symptom severity  The rule of thumb is that if it's a problem for you and it's inferring with your ability to function or affecting your quality of life  then by all means seek help for it   I also don't know if people realIze that therapists get paid to help people   it's a job  not a volunteer position  So I have no clue why people feel like seeking us out for help is a burden  It's a burden to put your problems onto your significant other or your friends for an extended period of time  but helping people sort out their problems is literally the job of a therapist  and one that we are trained to handle  Lastly  why people think that they are somehow a "stronger" person if they don't seek help for mental problems is beyond me    Would you say  "Well  I have a broken leg with the bone sticking out  but I think that I can make it on my own and that doctors have patients with 'real' problems so I should be able to handle this on my own"  Not to mention that it's very insulting to people that do have the courage to seek help   THAT'S being a strong person   So my advice to you would be to make an appointment with a therapist so you can start to feel better You should probably go see a therapist  I triedWhen you say you suffer from an inferiority complex  that is just one small part of who you are    Instead of feeling like your 'suffering' from this I hope you can exist without that guilt weighing over your head reminding you your not worthy  Are you interested in him Wot are condoms I already have an appointment set up  That's not what I was asking  Also  I don't self medicate with alcohol  I have no idea where you got that from  Because I had a few beers on New Years Eve  Don't you think you're being a little drastic  it's 6am on new years   nobody's up For oldies  look for anything with Vincent Price Sorry if I was a bit accusatory  You have nothing to feel bad about if you didn't know  especially if you didn't buy him  It's just something to consider  From your description  you seem like a good and responsible owner who provides George with company  which is good A lovely thought for his unborn child that they "ruined" their father's life I'm glad you found this   The negative talk has been a big part for me   Growing up I didn't really have supportive people in my life   My dad was a drunk and consistently undermined my achievements   My mom had so much anxiety that she would shut down my attempts at independence by the thought that I would harm myself or be lead down a negative   My aunt's family was intertwined with mine and her son my cousin was a sadist  obsessed with torturing me in any manner possible   Bullies  dismissive teachers  an inability to understand people  opportunistic friends   etc   The my pessimistic view of the world is practically hardcoded into my brain   I have to force myself back into my reality consistently on a day to day basis or else I get trapped by the voices of my past  I'm learning to train my brain into at least a less pessimistic version   I met a friend in an online chat group  she's much older than I am and has been through a lot   She helped me with the essay portion of a college application   As we went through each question  I would answer things in my way and she would point out that I was incredibly negative   She found a way to spin things into incredibly positive views that I would never have thought otherwise   In the difference between mine and the right kind of mindset is incredible   I understand where you are coming from with the anxiety   I thought my problems were solved a long time ago as well  but it's important to accept that there will be moments of relapse   It's a long process and I believe the best medicine is exposure to the events that cause anxiety   What helped me the most was a local support group that made me feel welcome  listened to what I had to say  and provided excellent feedback   To be honest  I wouldn't even dare to make posts like this online before but I've learned to be more open   I like that subreddit  it's spreading good vibes and certainly beats the heck out of advice animals  A lot of people certainly do point out my self awareness and I think I've been internalizing that more and more   Sometimes I wish I wasn't so self aware but I hope that it will allow me to help others when the time comes   As for the letters  Somewhere around Spring of 2016  I did my round of contacting   I contacted everyone that I possibly could   Some were happy to hear from me  others wanted more of an explanation  and some were completely angry and held onto so much resentment that no amount of what I said could change how they feel   It made me feel better but I still get glimpses of the person I used to be and have to shake the feeling I had back then   I'm at war with my demons and from time to time I get overwhelmed  but I'm doing whatever I can to fight back   I use Microsoft's OneNote to keep track of all my progress and it syncs with my phone so I'm always able to write down new bits of insight as they come   It's been helpful   Sorry for this incredibly lengthy reply  I have a knack for detail  I like that quote  "   doesn't mean you future can't be better than you ever imagined "  That really resonates with me   Good hearing from you and I hope you continue to make progress in your own journey   Lol congrats my friendAnd i never understood why  whatever I do I am this guy  It sucks  I hear you  and I understand why you're upset  It must be pretty frustrating  But it sounds more like she was scared to tell you about it and scared of your possible reaction  and she made a mistake by not telling you about her relationship with him sooner  And it sounds like she might really like him and is also scared to be honest  maybe with herself  about that  This doesn't seem like a reason to end your friendship with either of them  My best friend and I have been in each other's lives for more than three decades now  and we have dated many of the same guys are pretty years  It's pretty normal and something that happens with people a lot  I know so many people who started out dating one friend and then end up dating married to a different friend in the group  You can choose to be angry and lose your friends over it or you can be sympathetic  understand what your friends are feeling  and keep them in your lives  It's completely up to you This is exactly how I was treated throughout my teenage years  It's why as a 23 year old adult I try to have as little contact with other people as possible  Better to have no friends than "friends" like this Wake someone up and tell them Yes I realize that  I'm posting this as me seeing through their games  They obviously were more manipulative than that  The car wouldn't start From what I understand  the ending of a relationship is considered a loss of someone  so yes  you could apply the stages of grief from this  However  even when it comes to the death of a loved one  any model of stages of grief is not universal  Just because you do not follow the grieving stages of most people doesn't mean something is wrong with you   It might be possible that  to you  the relationship had ended awhile ago   when you first thought about breaking up with him  That happened to my past relationship  which went on for about two months longer than it should have    What you describe sounds like some dissociation  not to be confused with dissociative identity   Experiencing some dissociation doesn't necessarily mean a mental disorder  but it is a symptom of anxiety  Anxiety has a high comorbidity rate with depression  This is not  trivial   this is a  dealbreaker   I'm not a mental health professional  I may not be completely correct  Thanks for the response   Please note that I'm fairly green at reddit netiquette and culture  so I'm tentative about how things work here  and how do you produce the user links     My general approach to these discussions is that I avoid "how to" discussions as an introduction    The goal of my post is to start  dialog with the OP  not to write a self help book in every post   In my experience  90   of OPs never respond  and I don't want to burn energy saying more that necessary to elicit interest   My perspective is the result of my own 58 years of inquiry and effort  I did a lot of things in that time  including Zen and books and teachers and introspection and all the usual candidates    I like a lot of the usual spiritual growth tools  I'm not out to reinvent them from scratch or declare the One True Path   There are some aspects of my views that are a bit distinctive  or emphasized more than others somewhat   For example  I hold that "all transformation passes through freedom"  which is a claim about the nature of freedom and its relationship to being whole    To be whole  one must first become free  and "freedom" here refers to the ability to extract oneself from the addictions and traps that the mind constructs around ego maintenance and survival   Beyond freedom  I talk about "coherence"    coherence is the subject where the main question is "what does one do with freedom "  What's it good for  how should it be 'spent' to enrich the whole of life     I'm writing a book on my perspective  some more details about that can be found here  https   antiblog quora com The structure of transformation srid C3lYSeems fucked up  but I'm no birdologist so I don't know what Mr  Burt would want to eatIt is normal to feel those kinds of things when faced with distressing images  While  according to DSM  developing PTSD or ASD requires a life threatening event  it is possible that it has left a deep impact    What are some of the strategies people have suggested I believe it's time for you to learn Bird Law Welp  I've been doing it for 36 years and hasn't happened yet  Ain't nobody got time for that Multiply by altitude  substract several hours  add a bit of holy s       No wonder he passed out  I do believe that anxiety and depression cause long term cognitive impairment  just that for different people it's of different degrees  or not at all   Before I got depression and anxiety  my cognitive functioning was pretty fast  My grades were good  After illness  I could feel my own cognitive processing deteriorate  although I didn't know what was happening then  I was 12   I recently took a cognitive test and it was found that my cognitive functioning speed is slightly lower than average  The peak of my illnesses has passed  but I still have not gained the state of cognitive functioning I previously had  What is a "HR of 160"  Personally  I agree  But this is really more about her this time  If she wants something to show her friends  maybe a compromise is in order  A cheaper ring maybe Yup that's worseNot so much structured advice however here's some suggestions you may find helpful     Do some simple reading into body language  this was you can portray yourself in a friendly  open manner     Confidence  This will gain rapport with people much faster and increase your appeal to people  Have trouble with confidence  Fake it  It's really that simple  you fake confidence until it becomes natural     Find people with similar interests  This is the foundation for a friendship and a lot easier to get along with people who share the same interests     You're in high school  that's a great social situation where others are also learning social skills so don't get hung up if you get knocked down a few times      Make a lot of connections with people from different groups around school  you'll find having a positive reputation and network great in your social endeavour   These are some simple tips that will help you out I hope  if you need any further explanation I invite you to ask  Best of luck     Yisssss    https   media tenor co images a81c1a0802ff33f8e4b781a833d4b8b1 raw Anorexia Nervosa has one of the highest morbidity rates when it comes to mental illnesses  so it's definitely not something I think you should drop  However  you need to know that  should anything happen  it is not your fault  You are not responsible for your sister's health  but you can help    What are some possible reasons that she interprets the things you say as calling her stupid  People are so cold hearted  I obey no law that stands to prevent me from helping any life  human or animal  back to health  Tell a vet a friend gave you the bird and you noticed it has a limp  Quite sure it's not illegal to have a pet pigeon Like an apathy or numbness  I felt like that for several months after starting my current medication  It almost felt like my emotions were erased  bad and the good  Like I wasn't really excited or phased by anything at all  Like I couldn't feel anything  But apparently that was "normal" when your body and mind readjust to the meds  and then that numbness just went away after a long while  It was a "phase"  and it was even scary at times  There was depersonalisation  dissociation  and detachment going on  I sometimes self harmed just to feel something  and to convince myself that I existed at all   What helped me to deal was to just focus on some small goals  making tiny progress towards them  These included learning more about mental health  the specific disorders and symptoms  self help  It fed into my need to understand and to analyse  Perhaps over analyse  but I felt like knowledge is power and that while I couldn't feel I was making progress  intellectually I knew that this counted as progress in its own way    It gave me a sense of control  a grasp on it all   Also getting out of your own head is a healthy thing to do  I started reading  never used to do that much before   to kind of live someone else's life for a moment  listen to someone else's thoughts  I took loooong  silent walks in the English countryside with my dog  not really thinking about anything  The fresh air was good for me  and it counted as exercise   I was feeling so numb and empty  I went on a rampage of chaos manufacture  Argued with my boss and got myself fired  broke up with my boyfriend for no good reason  took a year of medical leave from my studies  left the country  I needed a shake  an earthquake to gain my senses back  I don't recommend this route  clearly  but that's how it was for me then   Recently it's all been very very different   I feel intense emotions again  Go figure  but I feel medications and life events and having a long depressive episode all played a big part in it  Would gladly hear your thoughts tl dr  It's called dissociation  It's a symptom of anxiety  You are not alone    It is something I relate to very much  It's called dissociation  not to be confused with dissociative identity   and it is something that everyone experiences once in awhile  although perhaps not to the extent of what you have been experiencing    It is often used as a coping mechanism for when your mind feels that it cannot handle what's happening  It is also often found in people with anxiety disorders  It feels absolutely horrid in a strange way  and I don't have advice for you  but just know that you're not alone  okay  Vegetables  fruits  nuts  seeds and legumes offer a complete nutritional profile  so there is no need in taking supplements  Also  most people in 2nd and 3rd world countries don't have much access to supplements and many still live well past 90  B12 is most likely the only supplement a plant based diet requires as most people wash their veggies and fruits and get rid of the B12 rich soil  You can get B12 from fortified nut milks or 1 small tablet a week  if people have access  Pigeons are filthy and potentially full of germs that are bad for people   Set him free and let nature take its course Heyyy I have the exact same diagnosis as you  We're sick buddies now     May I ask   what is it that stops you from sharing what you've realised w  your psych  I think it does matter when and how often  though  Having an irregular eating schedule whereby you sometimes do not eat enough to last you the day may lead to starvation syndrome    But it definitely matters how much you eat  One huge question  why didn't they include the diagnosis of acute tonsillitis  which is how the indication for surgery is based on  look up Paradise Criteria    Please correct me if I completely missed it in the methods     While this question is interesting  don't interpret this as saying you shouldn't have a tonsillectomy   Somewhat analogous to saying   we looked at all people who had an appendectomy and found that they are still as equally likely to present to the hospital with gastroenteritis causing diarrhea as control Do you have a counselor currently  Discuss this in session and request that he she call your parents and explain that you need their support and understanding  and that it is necessary for them to come in for psychoeducation and possibly family therapy  Your counselor should be happy to advocate for you in this way No real username I hope you're getting the help you need  There you go again with saying "fuck off" to some poster who didn't anything to you   like some 16 year old boy   Aren't you in your 30's  Seriously  maybe you should work on your social anxiety instead of taking it out on other people online   You need to practice what you preach   You're so quick to scrutinizing other people's comments  yet you can't take it when someone responds back to you  Other people have the right to express their opinions  as long as it's not violating rules or causing harm to others  Why is it okay for you to say fuck off to people and act like the wizard of oz  Yet  other people can't say something that you don't agree with or like    You're making all of these assumptions about someone's post when you don't even know all of the facts of what that poster intended   Can you learn to read properly first and then ask questions about what some poster means     All the best to you and your social anxiety  If this is how you act in your 30's  I don't know what life looks like for you in your 40's or 50's  Awww me and my boyfriend were similar    we met and started seeing each other just weeks before his 20th birthday    we lost our virginities to each other  on the night of his 20th While many cases are the result of confabulation  be it induced by a psychotherapist  it happens   it is possible that repressed memories do happen  A good example is PTSD  where victims tend to have a chunk of missing memory  especially rape  I'm thinking that it might be possible several missing chunks of memory has led to repressed memories of childhood abuse  What do you think  I may be wrong though haha  Happy New Year  I'm in CA and the sun came out for you today  I went to sleep alone and woke up alone and Sara   for some reason I wouldn't have it any other way    now  that may change   Take this time of solitude to reflect and really take in the beauty of this world  You are STRONG   Happy 2017  Let's change the world I blog about mental health awareness  and my experience with illness  http   dinoclaire wordpress com You stay out of it  Chances are she'll be less happy when she barely has money  If the guy isn't doing anything wrong then there is no hurry Yes I definitely agree with you  If you're afraid that you can't afford or you don't want people to know  you can try online counselling    Make sure the site you go to is credible  though  Otherwise may do more harm than good  So why are some people who don't have those qualities invited out  I've met some mouth breathing morons who have nothing to add to a conversation being invited and part of a social group   I think part of it is just being at the right place at the right time  When the social group formed  that person was there and included  It doesn't matter if they're boring and just sit there like they're half retardedI think it's important that you don't blame yourself for having to take some time away  You are only human  We all have our limits  Visit a counsellor for it if you have to  or it might lead to health issues that will affect your marriage grealty    The idea of couple therapy sounds great  I was gonna suggest it too hahaaa  I'm from Belgium but I use the Dutch equivalent of it all the time  I just call every woman or man that I don't know ma'am or sir  It gets their attention and I can never be wrong  Unless they're around my age or younger  then it feels weird  Then I'll just shout "Ey" TFW your "friends" said they were too busy to do anything last night then shared a video on Facebook of them all having a good time without you  Fuck my life They're probably jealous You do nothing  No one cares May I suggest getting off of all social media  It's toxic to your health  and I never realized how bad it was until I got away  You spend your time looking at others' lives convincing yourself that because there's never any bad things they must have perfect lives  They don't  the bad shit is there bubbling under the surface where you can't see it  But you do see the unhappy aspects of your life  and when you compare that to an idealized or fake life online  it drags you down deeper  Get off the social media and get away   The hardest thing to learn about this is that you need to live your life for you and only because you want to  Screw what anyone else thinks or expects Depression and anxiety actually have physiological  physical  causes   chemical imbalances  brain functioning  etc  If someone asks you "what is the purpose of your life "  how would you respond    What if they ask "who are you "  or "what's really important "  The thing that strikes me in your post is that there's no hint of a mention that meaning  values  or identity are on your radar at all   It seems to be entirely about your emotional cognitive state and the annoyance or upset about its volatility   But your mental state doesn't live in a vacuum  if you're healthy   It's part of a larger whole which includes how you understand yourself and your relationship to life and values    So the complete absence of any clue about your understanding of that stuff is itself a clue    I suspect that you just have no idea why you're here  and that emptiness is now expressing itself If trouble was money  I'd swear I'd be a millionaire    Girl here  What OP said about being yourself is key imho  as lame and unhelpful as that sounds  I've always wanted to tell guys who flirt with me too much  not that it happens a lot  not trying to say I'm all that or anything  that if they just talked to me like a person and not a potential fuck they'd have a much better chance of getting to know me and getting somewhere with me  It's so awkward to try to hold a conversation when a guy's trying to spin everything into a compliment    Like  if you think my hair looks nice today  that's nice  but I'd rather talk about Captain America or whatever  man  Sorry for the long comment  this just hit a cord with me  Try not to get discouraged  it'll happen when it happens and that's okay  Good luck Thanks  I hope the situation works out for you Tbf  you can rid yourself of your problems through therapy and self actualization your whole life  Living out your youth to the fullest is great  but if you missed out there's still so many possibilities when you get older to have fun and be yourselfHeart rate Some people wouldn't admit who they're attracted to  I'm saying this because I have a preferred type that I'm into and it's not something other people agreed on  If your friend approaches younger guys and behaves nicely  as long as he doesn't do anything inappropriate  I don't think it would be such an issue  I'm not gay nor a male but I feel like the guy wants to hang out with people he likes in order to reach out about his sexuality  it's not always easy to find someone else who is gay and like you back   As for you brother  I think whenever he has a match and your friend comes to watch  you should come along  You could have quality bonding time with him and your brother too  Show some protectiveness as an older sibling would do  Then one day if you and your friend are more comfortable talking about relationships  ask him what he's into  have an insight on his feelings Went how I thought it would  Approached girls at school library  Asked about what classes they were taking and majors etc  And they wanted no part of me  I don't even know why I did it  Most girls get approached alot and an unnattractive guy isn't worth their time  their just an annoyance Hey  check out r anxiety if you haven't already  It's pretty active there and people are nice  I always find it helpful to talk to others with a similar experience   I also freaked out this NYE so don't worry  it's not just you  To me it's quite a high pressure social situation because it doesn't have the nice family get together atmosphere of Christmas and it's more adult  everyone's drinking  you're expected to be "fun"   ugh  So not a good environment for my self esteem    I found u Mike77321's comment similar to what I would say about this   sometimes I can turn my 'i feel anxious so must be scared' into an 'i feel buzzy and adrenaline is going  time to get excited ' and just tell myself I'm actually looking forward to the thing  For example before an exam I'll tell myself I enjoy exams  It weirdly works    If you're not doing all the standard stuff already  here's that advice too  see your doctor if you haven't already  Not just for meds but also for therapy if you need it  Think of last night as a symptom of the flu  it's nothing to worry about but you should keep an eye on how you are  see your doctor  make sure there's a plan for your mental health care  and get treatment  When you have been over the relationship for a while  it's not uncommon to not have much of an emotional reaction  It could be grief or you could just be emotionally ready to move on  Had this thought today  I just wish something would conveniently end my life already  I tried to keep my spirit up over xmas and new year's  Was even feeling a little better thinking that going into the new year might help me get motivated but nope  feeling like shit already  Just had the realisation that it's most likely going to be another year of dealing with this fucking burden that is my life  I'm just done with it all to be honest  Now in your text you are making me think of another problem of depression   cognitive bias that maintain the symptoms What you think of yourself  your idealisation of your past self  and the just below average results can be bias that maintain the depression and be a trigger for future episodes     We really need new assessment tools Ahh yes  I never thought of that before  Just give her time  I think the best thing to do is give her some time   space  Respect her and understand her decision  There's nothing more worse than ramming   forcing it down her throat  Good luck I hope you both get back together if that's what you really want Why do you feel so The worst is when you see people that you think you could really connect with getting paired off with others  Like people who have similar interests or relatable personalities but they'll just never be interested in you  Feels fucking awful I know the feeling   sigh     I got strep every 6 8 weeks growing up like clockwork  I bet I had it at least 15 times before age 9  I got my tonsils out that year and am now 23 years strep free  and I have better breath than most people with tonsils   Story of half my life  With the other half being people seeing a great big "SUCKER" sign over me and trying to use attraction to steal my money     Edited because I can't spell "Story" while typing on my phone I'm in health and fitness man  I see gyno every day from bodybuilders fucking up their gear  Gyno has very little to do with weight  When you are fat  you have higher levels of aromatase  which will cause gyno  Just because it is associated in that one situation  doesn't mean it is relevant here  That's like saying a girl with a fibroadenoma of her breast can't reduce it with losing weight  Well no shit  your problem isn't you are too fat  I don't have the personality for a relationship  romance intimacy  It sucks because we're biologically wired to want it but really it's just the normal people and I'm not compatible with the "normal" women out there  I completely agree with you in giving Ashley a day or two to contact you to make things right or you should contact her about reimbursing you   Also it sounds like Ashley is kind of a hot mess   in more ways than one  My other suggestion is to maybe not hang out as much with someone like that who doesn't have control of their own life  Those kinds of people always have problems that somehow have to become other people's problems  Not fun or endearing Pigeons used to be the chicken of the world   We raised them to eat them   We bred them to breed faster and grow faster   We bred them to eat anything   Then we decided we liked to eat chicken more  and just like that  pigeons were abandoned   But those pigeons were perfectly suited to survive in our world   So they thrived as a feral animal    However people still eat pigeon  they just call it squab to make it sound fancy  and charge you for an exotic delicacy   Unfortunately the one thing they can't do  is untangle string and hair from their feet   The string or hair slowly tightens around their toe or foot and eventually amputated it  that's why there are so many birds that have mangled feet    So    feed your pigeon whatever you want   It'll eat it   It's foot is probably beyond help   If you decide to keep the bird  realize you're engaging in retaming a feral animal that used to be a common food and now is generally treated as a delicacy This is my thinking  I want to die but not kill myself  Maybe car accident  Hey  I managed to read it all  I've restarted my life when I hit 20  I moved out of the city  left my family   friends behind and grew a small circle of friends by volunteering at my local cafe  I moved in my own place and met a girl who is now my gf of 2 years and we have a 1 year old with another on the way  I started with nothing and now I have so much  Moving away and leaving it all behind is big enough to restart your life  If you really want too I say go for it as you have so many oppurtunity to do what really makes you happy  I hope I stayed on the topic here  Thanks  I hope so too Happy new year Being a FIFTH wheel hurts so much    Doesn't really help that I don't like any of my "friends" and just circle around them out of convenience  I guess normies notice those things   You didn't feel committed to a relationship  so you didn't feel a sense of loss when it ended  Plus  if it ended on bad terms  it wouldn't be strange to feel a sense of relief that it was over anyway    There's nothing wrong with you  it seems like you might have 'settled' for those guys  like shrugging and saying 'why not '  instead of waiting for a relationship with someone who would make you feel excited and proud to be in a relationship with  It's not bad to think of those experiences as learning  learning what you'd like in a relationship  in a partner  what you like about yourself  etc    If you haven't met a guy that you'd be ecstatic to be asked out by  then that doesn't mean you're gay  Especially if the thought of sex with a guy turns you on  It just means that no guy has yet met your standards  Conversely  if you know of a woman who you'd be passionate about dating  then you might be gay or bi I actually do have dogs  not technically emotional support animals  but they do provide me with a lot of emotional support  Ironically they wont sleep with me So not looking forward to this  I start back on Tuesday  Luckily I go early in the mornings so it's not as bad  usually  But there is a noticeable difference and I fuckin hate it  Language is the core of all things  Focus on beoming more literate  Read things  fiction or non fiction  The process of reading will expand your language skills and knowledge of topics  There really is no other answer that will give you better results    The kids who start school knowing how to read already will have infintely better lives than the kids who didnt have parents teaching them anything  This fact extends throughout life  Never stop reading   As an adult your time may be better spent reading news  or articles on information    One thing i do every week  on monday  I go to lists like  this one  https   en wikipedia org wiki 2016 in science   I look at the most recent discoveries that have happened since the last monday  and i learn about them  Sometimes not much happens in a week  sometimes major things are discovered and i will spend the time learning  Mainly for my own interest  but i also know a hell of a lot of stuff now  and without sounding too full of myself  people always enjoy talking with me because i talk about fascinating things they dont know  Maybe that makes me sound intelligent  maybe it would make you sound intelligent er  too I've come to the conclusion that a lot of what we're struggling with here is just basic evolution  Those who got the most in the genetic lottery   looks  personality  confidence  skills etc   will always just win out over the rest of us  I keep seeing my friends and family pair off and I keep wondering what the hell I'm doing wrong  I mean I'm a pretty nice guy or so I keep getting told and I'd like to think I'd be a genuine partner to someone else but nope  33 years old and alone as fuck because apparently I'm not really anyone's "type"  Mom  dad  wait for it     And my aunt  I mean  that's kind of why I'm here    I guess I'm kind of hoping that somebody knowledgeable in this field will find my post  "Can't Change It Back To Numbers House"I'm sorry for your loss  please feel free to PM if you need someone to talk too  Congrats  I wonder what it must feel like I really really want to  but I'm not going to see him in person until late March at the earliest  I don't know if I can wait that long  but I also don't want to be he person who tells him something like this through text etc  Housey McHouseface sounds wonderful I understand where you're coming from  I too owned my own business at 21  I bought into a franchise  and was everything from the janitor to the CEO  There was no getting away from work  I literally drove work home every evening  The pressure was too much for me  and I realized that  at least then  I was not ready to run a business  After admitting that to myself  I terminated the franchise and went and got a job    I've moved up pretty rapidly in the company I work for  and I've learned a lot from my boss and his boss  The thing that stands out the most is the amount of items the delegate  They've surrounded themselves wit people they trust  give us tasks and expect them to be completed  They do not micromanage  This leaves them free to do their own work    You will figure this out  you didn't make it to where you are without knowing what you're doing  Offer them gum or a mint after they finish their coffee  Either they take the hint or they say something about it  then you could jokingly say something like  "Yeah  your breath stinks "You're protecting yourself to avoid pain and upset  but that protective wall is like a cage  and you start to behave like a restless predator within the walls    ready to slash at someone who comes too close to your bars   This is just no way to live   Life starts when you value freedom more than comfort LOLOL i love word playI am not sure how to process this    thank you It sounds like he thinks sex is a big part of relationship  and it sounds like you two have multiple issues to work through with that  You need to have a serious conversation about these things  trying to brush it under the rug is just going to make it blow up on you later Stop drinking if this is how you act when you drink  You know it's wrong to intimidate people when you are sober so do not drink  People do not deserve to be scared because you think that is a way of solving a problem  This should be a wake up call for you to look at yourself and see about taking care of this before you lose another Hannah  PeaceHow many times a day do you shower Avoid them  Thanks  I figure by the first few weeks of her having to deal with me in a few classes  it might help things  In a month or two I'll see if things have changed At least you went outside  I don't leave my apartment unless it is for work How are you doing  Doesn't sound good  You can try to call a docter if the symptoms are unbearable  try also some pills so your     will slow the work  Drink some coca cola against the puking   I hope for you it's a little bit done right nowI agree with you  sigh Please direct me to the 'what' you are  fucking    I hope for the same  brother  Just the thought of it fills me up with warmness  If I do I will let people know winning the lottery won't give me what I wantNumberless Manse  I got a few issues  I could stand to go up a cup size or two  lose a few pounds from the stomach or thighs  But I look fine  I look like a normal  healthy human woman  It would not be bizarre for someone to find me attractive  For the first time in my life  I'm pretty much okay with how I look   You are beautiful  Inside and out  I hope you know that  Stay a happy little sushi roll     Try to hang out in a bar and have a talk  Go travelling alone or meet people on meetup com  Be outgoing and in seek for meeting new people   As you say making friends in your earlier years are easier  You are still young and a ton of memories ahead   Go for itI'm so ugly I can't be considered human  I'm a monster walking amongst mankind  that is why I will never have any friends and will never get a girlfriend Hey  if you see some fat and flabby folks looking lost  be kind  They need this  Help them get started right  if you can  Chances are most of them won't last  but you can help ensure that the ones who do are the kind you don't mind sharing a gym with  This is a good point  Sex shouldn't be your only priority  I don't get it  You're saying their pussies dry up around you  Ive never been in your exact situation  but whatever emotions that you are feeling go ahead and feel them   You're are through something that is going to effect the rest of your life   surround your self with positive people and do your best not to numb yourself with drugs and alcohol I promise it will only make things worse   so in other words its a vicious cycle  you can't kiss anyone on new years because you're lonely  you're lonely because you can't kiss anyone on new years Sorry  I meant heart rate  i'm terrible for doing that You can talk to people here though  I'm sure some can relate How  They will see me and find where ever I am So is it looks  confidences  skills     What's your weakness  You are horrible  get a shittier apt you succubusTalk about a self fulfilling prophecy the only way to starve is to not eat enough  it may be hard to eat enough if you do only eat once a day though Everything is definitely starting to make sense for sure  now it's just slowly working on fixing the things that made me so depressed  You're right  things definitely won't be perfect  but as long as I'm not over stressing the situations I think I'll do alright  The adrenaline rushes in life will always be my favorite parts    Thank you seriously for taking the time  it's very appreciated  This thread has left me with open minded again with the new year rolling in  Weird how today's the new year and I woke up feeling no negativity like I used to  I hope this year will be a good one  and I'm here to talk to as well   Happy New Year    Yeah  true  Good points  I'll take this into account  Appreciate it   Just walk away So you want a friend in real life  Online work for you  HahaNew group of friends who have similar interests to mine  Wow  They are huge bitches Yes  they help with social skills issues  If your problems are caused by an underlying disorder  you will be diagnosed and treated  If you're just bad at social skills  they will still help you  Maybe they'll send you to classes  Or they'll help you be more confident or whatever the issue is  I would recommend visiting one  At least you'll know if you have a disorder and you will get help  Keep in mind they can't make magic  though  Good luck  OPLol at your cat trying to share your breathing air  But I understand it's a problem  You'll have to keep gently re positioning the cat  maybe so she is leaning over your shoulder or her head is against your neck   One of my cats likes to lay on my chest and when I first got him  he would get as close to my face as he could and put his arms around my neck  then knead my neck with his claws  A bunch of times in a row  I kept my hands up on my chest by my face so he would have to lay a little farther down  Sometimes he would just leave rather than lay in a second choice spot  but it wasn't long before he learned that he can lay on me happily a little farther down and accepted it    Good luck And if you win  you can also officially claim the title 'Powerballer'  Because when we ball  we ball guud  self compassion principles sometimes feels like I'm lying myself  We all lie to ourselves pretty frequently  Fake it til you make it is a sound strategy sometimes  Pretend to be compassionate to yourself frequently enough and eventually it'll actually happen   tend to get stuck with CBT at the column where you have to come up with all the reasons why the sad anxious depressive thought you are thinking about yourself is true  So skip that column  do the other bits about why it isn't truegoogle some sort of bird rescuer group in the area   there usually are always people who devote their loves to saving birdsYeah I have a counselor  Thats a good idea I think you have me confused with someone else  But yes  you should probably reach out to this Jeffrey person  Thank You very much for your reply  It definitely helps  Happy New Year  a kid who had bullied me for two years so bad I wanted to quit college  and occasionally contemplated suicide  At this party  I was so excited to be with my crush I was ready to bury the hatchett and pretend he had never made my life hell  even though he never apologized  At the party  my crush and my bully made out on the sofa I was sitting on  Then they went off to have sex  I drank a lot and wandered back to my room to cry    this was too hard to read  man  It made me really really sad  it's just another proof how fucked up and unfair this world is  nobody gets what they deserve    From what you wrote you seem like a pretty normal person who does lots of activies with people  attending parties and has dreams  I lack all of those things  So could your problem be just looks  I don't know  do you have any deformities  Is it possible you're just surrounded by assholes who don't cherish you  I just don't see the reason for people treating you this bad Possibly   You can have a mental ailment which stops you from forming memories properly   in which case you may not be helpable   However  you may just not be skilled at forming memories   Memories are formed by two things   emotional attachment and repetition   Your brain chooses to remember things related to strong emotions on the assumption that those are the important things   The easiest way to remember things better is to use repetition   When you are introduced to someone  immediately repeat their name   Say "nice to meet you NAME"   That helps significantly with remembering names I'm sure the life you have lived has led you here  Just putting it out there  that the life I live has shown me the exact opposite  My friends rapidly change  I still know my buddies from high school  but the friend I spend the most time with changes nearly monthly based on what's happening  I can't see people meeting you  holding up a list of their current friends  and seeing where you fit in haha  If a random guy came up to me at the gym and asked for me to help him  like has recently happened  I spend 2 hours a day with him  Could say he is my best friend at this point  even though we have only known each other for a month  and have lived very different lives until this point  We share a common goal at this point  and have bonded over it  It's as simple as that  Find people with common goals I am so sorry you lost your friend  I know there is little I can say  but maybe this will help   When good people find a way into your heart  they live there forever Get an adult dog  not a puppy    Puppies are tons more work   Get a dog that is not too large   Dogs you can physically pick up and control are easier   Go to a shelter and meet the dogs   Spend some time with them before you choose one   Don't just choose the first that runs up to you   I am sure there is a subreddit about dogs or adopting dogs that can provide more advice Think through why this bothers you   Are you scared you got infected with something   Is there some reason this should cause lasting trauma   Or was it just a shock We can't tell you if it is an actual date  only he can Or "Number Twelve" but replace with the actual number it would be ask on the subreddit for your city   Each city is differentWhy does it matter that they are black How old are you  maybe he likes you and wants to fuck  give it a go    I guess that's a start  Thanks    I think you're being used  If you want someone to watch your dog  at least you should tell them in advance  And give them dog food or money for dog food   I don't know what's a good thing to do here  but don't let this continuecheck out a learning languages or german subreddit for adviceGet this girl to hook you up with her friends  Sounds like you're already in with her  You win the approval of one of them  you've won all of their approval  Congrats buddy  That is really huge  There was absolutely nothing sexual involved at all so nothing to worry about with infections etc etc  Literally just an unanticipated split second feel    I think it was just the sheer shock of the situation and the fact that I started 2017 by grabbing it by the balls  literally  What kind of house is it  Is it large  Is it on some property  Anything notable about its construction or the land it sits on  Any interesting geographical features nearby    These things are important when naming a house  because if you're inland on a meadow and you call it "Crestwater" or "Eagle Heights"  that would be simply inaccurate and strange    Give us the necessary information to help you  Are certain wildlife common to the area     My house actually has a number  but I named it anyway  in my head  it's an unofficial name  because I love the idea of houses with names  Ours is on a hillside and we get a great view of wildlife  including deer  in our backyard  so it's "Hartsview" This is so ridiculous I can't even tell if you're trolling No   Escalating with someone who is going to vomit will not go well   Talk to the person who threw the party to find out who she is and how to contact her Sorry to hear thatThat girl must be a psycho Then the shock will wear offWutIf they didn't tell you  they must care how you feel about it   Talk to them   Don't just throw away friendships like that Can I just say  you did a great job playing Greg in 8 Mile    EDIT  C'mon guys  you can't tell me he doesn't look like Greg Buehl Weed is too illegal and too expensive  I have no idea where I'd get it anywayWash your clothes and clean your bedroom  I'm not totally sure how much stuff you have in your bedroom  but by going thru some of your old belongings you may may not get a sense of nostalgia and you might even feel better  On top of that you say you don't want to get better but if you were truly content with being all of THIS then you wouldn't feel the need to get it off your chest  Soo build a routine for yourself    start by going on walks either super early in the morning or very late at night and try to use that time to think and look at new things  personally what I do is I drown out the world with music and I try to admire the stars  That's really the best you can probably do for yourself Why don't you just actually make plans  You can't draw too many conclusions from what is presented here That's not TOO too much to go on  but maybe "Sherwood Cottage"  or something do to with Maid Marian  "Mariansong" Good luck with that  Every year i try and go to sleep before new year's a and its these people and their damn fireworks disturbing the peace and I cannot sleep at all  Worst of all  fireworks are illegal in the city limits yet  the law never gets enforced Aww  yay  Congrats   happy almost birthday    Your inner monster came out a bit and roared last night  The monster didn't win  If so  you would've hit her face and not the wall  The red flags were already up for her when you blocked her from exiting the situation by putting up your hands on either side of her  All you can do is apologize  and not be that person that she thinks you are  Practice some emotional regulation techniques and become a better  Cheers m8 No matter how smart you are for your age  being a teenager is always the trickiest part of your life emotionally  you're trying to figure yourself out  your relationships and where you fit in with society  You're going to experience some measure of anxiety    If you feel like the loneliness and anxiety and mood swings are ACTIVELY fucking with your ability to live a day to day life and just being disruptive to any routine or chance you have at improving yourself or just being a person  THEN you need some professional help    Other than that  you're at a fragile  confusing part of your life  So is the girl you're so mad at  So are all your peers who are smoking or doing drugs or whatever  in fact  for them  it might be MORESO   So just   find a bit of comfort in that you're not alone in feeling like this  and just be good to one another  High school's a bummer as it is     I was at this psychologist for 2 months  Like 8 sessions  Calm down  no big deal   I mean what was the actual impact to you Reading this felt very similar to a situation I went through last year   I was quite possessive of my friend and got jealous seeing her make an effort to go to drinks with her colleagues and do all sorts of things  I wanted her to invite me to things but she never did   she claimed it was because she knew I'd be uncomfortable but I'd told her before that I wanted to push myself  I think she didn't want me there dragging her back   She stopped contacting me and that made me even more upset  In the end I was the one who cut her off because I could tell that she didn't REALLY want to be my friend  she said that wasn't true but you don't go 1 year without contacting your so called best friend   Don't feel like you HAVE to help your friend  especially if you feel he is holding you back  You should be friends because you actually both like being around each other not because you have no one else   Otherwise you could both make a decision to meet up every so often and talk on the phone often  Before my friend and I broke up this is what we decided   we met up once a month on payday and we Skyped once a week  Our relationship got so much better and I actually felt like I had a proper friend  i dont think it would have hurt to casually ask for some kind of contact info before you left momentarily  in fact its the perfect opportunity  something along the lines of "hey i need to go check up on my buddies out back  ill be right back  but just in case i lose you  do you mind if i get your number real quick  really glad i met you tonight " pretty simple  if she says no you can move on  if yes  score Yeah  Cascadia earthquake   At first it worried me but if I didn't get killed right away  I could just focus on survival like our brains were designed to do   Happy birthday Hope that is sincere hahayeah she did  next ones gonna be your mum  then ur sister  Tough luck buddy    you're gay now    Maybe you and your friend will get together I suppose it is like quitting anything when you are ready you are ready    Good luck Hon  I'm proud of you  It takes a lot of strength to free yourself from a toxic person   hugs Your friend is purrrdy I know exactly how you feel  I'm always turned to for advice for everything  whether I'm able to do it or not  I've never been in any committed relationship ever and I have the same thoughts  The thought always crosses my mind that if I came out  closeted gay here  then I may find someone  but I just don't see that happening  What has really helped me is finding a suitable best friend  I guarantee nothing is better than having someone there for you when you're down and you're there for them  It's like a special bond that will never break I got a new phone a few weeks ago  That's what my message screen has looked like the whole time   thanks  I was thinking of a shelter dog anyway but spending time with them all hadn't occurred to me cheers You would have to start a subreddit or ask a mod of a current sub to put you on as a mod of their sub  No  All you gather from this is that your cousin can't imagine being attracted to  Which  unless you want to f    your cousin  is a goos thing  She let you stick your face between her legs so yeah she was attracted and yeah other girls will be attracted to you over the course of your life  As cliche as it sounds  the main thing that attracts girls is confidence Maybe she was desperate  Who cares  He is obviously jealous  The same reason most people here hate on attractive people that could be the nicest people in the world for all they know  That pain turns into jealousy for those who don't feel that pain Congrats on mucking her barn btw hahaWhat did you want of them Eggs are really good for birds in moderation  It's similar to a heifer eating her placenta after giving birth to a calf  Has lots of good nutrients in it   That said  a little wet cat dog food mixed with warm water will tide him over well too   I'm not sure what it's like where you are OP  but at a Clinic I used to work for it was policy to euthanize any injured pigeons to that were brought in  on the spot  due to disease prevention as they carry the equivalent to aids for birds Did you do anything else stupid apart from drink too much Thank you  As I wrote it  I thought 'of course you are being used ' but I know that if I turned them away next time  I'd second guess myself and feel guilty  So ty Nope  Just fumbled around and acted like a slight retard who was laughing at everything how can u prevent ur car getting stolen u cant change ur car lock rightwow thanks for the advice man  and I will check out Mike Oldfield haha I'm that friend who everybody ignores when I'm talking   story of my life  One I met on tinder and the other on another app that I can't recall  I don't really care what comes of girls when I meet them  if you're not meant to date then you're not meant to  but to be plain manipulative stringing me on  which I see as extremely disrespectful  isn't acceptable  Wow I'm very sorry about everything  and I appreciate your advice  I have another friend who is kind of in the same situation as me with the same people so we have been talking a lot  Thank you  Thank you for posting to  r helpmecope  While you wait for users to post and help you  please take a look at  the Wiki page  http   www reddit com r helpmecope wiki index  that contains

Interesting result googling that word   Brickey McRobinhood  happy new year to you too  and thank you for helping me out here  I know that this stuff happens when people get older too  but I don't wanna lose this friendship so I will try to talk to them  What do you expect when you stay home for 3 days without warning  You can screw over their entire schedule for that day Yes Ah  alright  Thanks   Well that seems a little off haha  I'm Canadian  but I lived in the states for 5 years for school  I can honestly say that the heavy majority were shitty people   compared to Canadians at least  Even though people were nice  they were often very inconsiderate  and felt compelled to brag about every accomplishment they ever had  I hated every second of being surrounded by them  Never considered living in America  I can undearstand your view haha  In my experience  the girls were much more pleasant than the guys though I just never thought it was that relevant  or a byproduct of my psychotic features I still stick to the old "I would rather cry in a GTR than a bike "If it's outside quiet hours  they won't take noise complaints  It's not illegal to be noisy in the daytime You forgot to "take 5 showers brah" Wow  I'm sorry to hear that  Your brother sounds like an extremely difficult person  Sometimes there is no other way to deal with difficult people than avoid them completely    If you want to fix this problem  there is one more thing you can do however  This might not be in the cards at the moment  but if you try  you may find success  I recommend you and he go to a counselor  It will cost money  but the counselor will basically let you have the conversation you wanted to have yesterday  and act as a referee of sorts  He she won't let your brother back you into a corner  He she will offer professional advice and other ways to heal this relationship  If you truly want to mend this relationship  and are willing to put in the work  I recommend it highly    Again  you may not want to try this  He is a difficult person  and sometimes there's no changing that  He's wronged you enough  and doesn't plan on changing anything  so dropping him may be your best bet   If you do leave your family  I recommend you tell your mother  and leave a note for your brother  Let him know he is the reason why you don't think you can associate with your family anymore  and that you tried to fix it    Again  I'm sorry it didn't work with the first method  I do highly recommend counseling  but it can be hard to do for some people  Good luck OP Well  fuck  I am more doomed than I thought  r GermanPractice may help  Duolingo is also pretty good for practice and is free  unlike Rosetta Stone I applied to Pizza Hut again last night but before then like 2 to 3 weeks agoIf it's affecting your social relations negatively then it might be a good idea to stop doing it Pizza Hut IHOP places like thatIt doesn't matter how you look if you don't know how to react when people try to talk to you  I have a number of severe mental disorders which prevents me from integrating with society like a normal person so it really does make it hard finding a relationship  let alone friends in general    Ah ok  Just realise they are just worried about you  Alcohol is damaging especially to a smaller younger body  and obviously alcohol can make you get into dangerous situations    Many people have done what you have  probably even your own parents    however you need to seriously listen to what they have to say because the world is a different place to what it was when I was young or your parents were young    My 'Advice' would be try and take an adult approach and discuss the situation  Maybe do a bit of research about why alcohol can get young people into trouble  then you would understand why they are both mad and worried  When you can understand why they would be angry and worried then you will be able to have an adult conversation with them about what happened and understand why it is a serious situation for someone your age to get very drunk   If you want to clear the air then maybe you will have to start the conversation and listen to what they have to say and see what you learn  Things will be ok after that i'm sure Just the mere fact that I made out with someone and felt their balls without expecting it basically   Just a general shock to the system basically  Try it while you can  Don't be that 30 year old creep walking around the mall looking for victims Alright  Thanks dude I appreciate it  Exactly  I had controversial shots to rid myself of mouth lesions  Worked perfectly You can change the locks on your car   just go to a reputable mechanic I'm impressed here  GjI swear I'll remember the smile that came on my face when I read this  It's been wonderful having this conversation with you fellow Redditor  Have an amazing First  Can't you outsource your position and grow multiple business ventures at this point so you don't get too attached to one when it's not so good  The true skill is hiring the right person  maybe you're not a CEO person  that's ok  You gotta find someone who is  Your skill is the creation of the business  but running it is a different game   Then again this is advice from a 27 year old who hates her mediocre  low ish paying job Thanks for the input y'all I am in the same boat  I've found cashiers  waitresses etc have been a great low risk way to get used to talking to people  I'm going to try the same thing with smiling  too  She kind of made a dick move by not talking to you after you went with your "sick" friend  You had ever right to be mad  you just took it too far  Stop blaming yourself for what happened  you can't change the past  Let it go and forgive yourself but don't forget what happened  so you won't make the same mistake again  We all deserve to die 2girls1OPI'm so sorry  it might be hard  but you have to realize you are not alone  Many people live with HPV and herpes and it's not a dealbreaker for many relationships when it's honestly communicated and properly maintained  Lots of people don't have symptoms of either and yet still carry the STD  Silver lining is if it's HPV then it clears in 1 2 years by itself and every sexually active person by 30 yo gets it at least once  Both STDs are not blocked by condoms entirely because the skin is touching   Feel better and take care of yourself  3Who laid the pipe He must have been showering when it happened Lynda com offers a subscription based service to learn anything  Programing  business skills  socialI can reccomend this website for further reading    https   speakoutloud net  I agree with you   Sorry not everyone can just drink and drink and feel dandy especially the next morning  They need to cut it out to be honest most people seem to forget most of what is said  Research showed that only 50  of what is told when meeting a doctor will be remembered  So I think it might be less of a problem then you might think   But to fix it  try to repeat the things you want to remember  You can store around 7 things in short term memory which can be directed to long term so you will always forget parts  but chose the important parts  Tell people that you often forget things  to make them understand    If it is a big problem in your day to day life you might consider seeing a doctor and talking about what it could be  If you have already gone to a doctor you can also try a psychologist  He she may know what is going on  You might just have other things going through your head or adhd or add  Then again  let a psychologist decide these things  because with the information you give me it is hard to really draw conlusions    Remember  most redditor are not doctors  always visit your family doctor before chosing therapy  Congrats on your success  That takes a lot of courage to put yourself out there like that  You are clearly a strong person  and I can't see you being FAOne of the hardest things for someone to do is admit that something is wrong  I hope everything works out for the best for you I agree with  u TheModernLoki in that good language skills are the crux of it  I'll address the 'intelligence' part   there are many books and articles in this sub which already deals with the social and delivery part of this   You fix this by changing your behaviours  An intelligent person constantly and forever looks to improve themselves and expand their knowledge  Learning never stops  not even for a day  My mantra has for a long time now been "Do the things you have to do to be the person you want to be"    This works on several levels  firstly it starts your change with an emotional desire or vision  Then this allows your brain to rationalise your sudden changes in behaviour and motivates you to eventually cement new habits  To improve intelligence  surround yourself with nothing but intellectually stimulating media  I mean move as far away from media with weak language skills and towards media with strong language skills  We are social creatures and we absorb behaviour and language from those around us     If you like TV  stop watching adverts  soap operas  cheap laugh sitcoms  anything with a laughtrack etc  and engage with better quality content     If you like Reddit  start subscribing to  better subs  http   www refinethemind com reddit mind 44 smart subreddits    and remove the default subs     If you like Youtube  subscribe to as many engaging Youtube channels as possible  and unsubscribe to those cheap puns vlog channels  If clickbait pops up as suggested  click on the grey dots and select 'I'm not interested'  Throw in a few philosophy channels  e g   TheraminTrees  https   www youtube com user TheraminTrees    Sam Harris  https   www youtube com channel UCNAxrHudMfdzNi6NxruKPLw      If you read  subscribe to engaging magazines or absorb good books  no trashy pop novels      If you read news articles  learn how to become critical and a skeptic  Learn the scientific method for deducing things  including a bit of statistics  For anything you care about believing  always hunt down the original source and assess its methodology     If you like movies  stop watching those with cheap flicks and quick laughs and look out for those with better storylines and more serious actors     Listen to thought provoking audiobooks or podcasts each night   One of the best ways to develop a good understanding of something is to teach it to others  Tutoring or volunteering is great for this   Find a way to interact with intellectual people  Join a group  a quiz team  or whatever it might be  Successful people tend to surround themselves with smart people   There are good books on memory and recall out there to access those interesting facts  We know that some parts of the brain continue to produce neurons into adulthood  including the hippocampus  Grow that part of your brain by practicing memory and recall   Never stop learning  not even for a day friends come and go  get the crappy ones out of your life to make room for the good ones  or none at all       The video below posted earlier on Reddit and it was helpful to me in knowing how to smile at people  Also I agree with the others  practice   https   www youtube com watch v 1zpf8H Dd40Slight correction  "I'm that friend that doesn't get invited to hang out ever"    See a doctor Well if you really care for her  and can treat her better than others because of that  sounds like she would be lucky to have you  It will probably be hard to be rejected by her  but you can't say you won't provide what she needs better than the guy she ends up with  If you are too scared to talk to her about this  that is fine  Own that excuse  Saying it's because she doesn't deserve you is bullshit  Unless you're a rapist or some other dark shit like that  Then ya  if you care about her  fuck off  But really  limiting this girl's options for her  without her knowledge  does not show you care  One thing first     I know this shouldn't bother me as much as it currently is since ultimately I passed       but it genuinely does   IMO  it's a good thing that you're bothered by intellectual bulimia  Facts can be useful and engaging  if  they help you understand the world  but memorizing facts simply because you have to is an exercise in futility  Yet  many educational systems teach memorization rather than understanding    And higher education is filled to the brim with people who are content that way  which we can't fault young people trying to find a place in this world for   but it's still sad  I think you very much  should  be bothered by this and it's a good thing that you're yearning for more   Now  onto the issue   u TheModernLoki makes some smart points  Reading helps being well versed in three ways     you gain knowledge  It's far easier to have an intelligent conversation if you're informed  plain and simple     you broaden your vocabulary in certain special areas  Knowing technical terms can come in handy     you broaden your general vocabulary  In other words  you become generally more well versed  This is probably the most noticeable and important change  Being able to express your ideas precisely is probably one of the most important life abilities  Notice that there's a difference between  passive  vocabulary  i e  words that you understand  and  active  vocabulary  words that you actually use   The latter can only increase through practice   Notice that there are many ways to be an interesting conversationalist  Personally  I don't keep up with news   there are a couple of arguments against it  but that would be out of the scope of the discussion for now   but important developments find their way into my personal thought bubble anyway  Devouring some non fiction might not be a bad idea  but a well written novel  a classic  heck even influental literary smut can be a source of enlightenment  Ever thought about what "Fifty Shades of Grey" can tell you about the way its readers think and what they like  dream of  fantasize about    So read  And watch  and listen and most importantly  practice That requires an amazing amount of strength   It doesn't seem that way now  but you are strong   I am pulling for you   I know it sounds corny  but every day I will think about you and send you all the positive energy I can muster   Good luck to you Tough choice  First off I don't think you should just throw in the towel on your math courses  You can pass those exams  Get your ass to the math lab and do it everyday  Or take your trip  I think you should do whatever you will regret less because you can't do both  We only get one shot at life  Stick it out and pass those effing classes or take that trip  It's your life but YOU CAN do either  Hey  wow  good job  That's extremely impressive  even normies find cold approaching terrifying  I think next time  after you add them on Facebook  you should ask them out on a date  I definitely think you're close to getting a girlfriend if you keep this up I'm starting to realise tinder is a tool to affect your self esteem  If you're a woman  it's a huge ego boost  If you're a guy below 8 10  it's just going to make you feel bad about yourself    I probably get a match about once a month or so  and that's using it every day  It's just not worth the effort  This logic makes zero sense  Because if loneliness is guaranteed for not kissing  then your never getting a kiss the following New Years  At some point everyone was kissless during a New Year's Eve  And not everyone is lonely  Superstitions are one thing  but they have to have logic behind them First  make sure you have a place to sleep  keep your stuff  shower  and charge your phone  If that's a shelter in the area  start looking now because they're probably pretty full up given the season  Also  if you do stay in a shelter  keep a close eye on your stuff because otherwise it'll get stolen  If you have friends or family members that are willing to take you in  be as polite as possible and try not to stay too long in one place  Clean up after yourself and then some  Try to help wherever you can so as not to over stay your welcome    Once your immediate safety is handled  your  1 priority is to find a job  Any job  Anything that brings in income   Fast food sucks  but if you work your ass off and always take shifts it's easy to get promoted  Finding something in stocking warehouse is also a good entry level start  If this means you put off school until that's stable  that's okay  A delay doesn't have to be a forever thing  Once you have an income  find a room to sublet on Craigslist and build up from there   This is a shitty situation  and I'm sorry you're in it  You're going to have to grind for a while  but it's not impossible to get out of it  Good luck  OP Why understanding  If you want to change the locks and provide them with a key it shouldn't matter should it i don´t think it´s self esteem honestly  we have talked about it  but he says it´s just all the stress we´re under right now  i want to be understanding but i also want to resolve this  i guess it´s the stress but one can´t help wondering if it´s because of me  you know  obviously you all don´t know every detail  but with what i´ve said do you think it´s wise to stay in this relationship and hope he changes  the emotional part   and to answer the emotional part i guess has been going on for about 4 years  and the lack of interest in sex for like a year and a half  when do you know it´s over I think the best response is just "Thanks  but no thanks   I don't see a platonic relationship working out between the two of us "It doesn't sound corny at all  it's nice to hear and it is reassuring  Thank you for your kindness stranger  it means a lot  AmenI'm sure you girls get responses like  this   https   i imgur com PQ0t5pW jpg  all the time    salmost any cat We are both KHV and completely FA   I went on a date with a girl and we did some sexual stuff  ate her out but still a virgin  Probably lifting the shower too The same thing happened to me for a while  My brother noticed it and told me that I was always the one making the plans within my small friend group  we were friends for about 5 years   For a while over the summer  I stopped making plans to do stuff  to see if they would step up and plan something  Nope  instead they would put on snapchat how bored they were  It took a lot of thought but I decided to cut them from my life  I'm alone more often now but I've come to terms with that  Wasting my time and energy on people who don't care was frustrating  This might not work for you but it is an option you can do  but ill stand in the garden with you   youre not alone  things will get better  Some land lords and people in general  are unreasonable assholes  Depending on the state OP lives in  he could be held responsible for whatever happens to that apartment  Odds are if the landlord decides to be difficult  OP would end up spending a lot of time and some money to get his name cleared and damages to be settled  If I was the land lord I'd go out and buy the locks for him  But not all people wouldn't even be decent enough to allow him to change the locks  It also depends on how strict OP's contract is I would call the cops  But that's just me Cats are awesome  You sound awesome too  Though there's a good likelihood she will deny it to the police  you should call and give them the pictures  There should be a paper trail of his abuse with authorities even if it doesn't lead to charges or conviction initially  And an officer may be able to give her resources to get out   Unfortunately  there isn't a best answer for this situation  specifically because she doesn't want to get out of it  But calling the police might give her an opportunity Me  There was this time with a friend     Cousin  Don't you say you have never had any friends   Me  You know what I mean  people I play videogames with that don't really like me but get mad at me if I don't call them friends  I have that small discussion almost weekly I've been told to get  Witcher 3 several times now lol  Do I need to play the others to know what's going on   Also I have overwatch and I need don't really play it  I can playshare it if you want They are sooooo cute   That's the best kind of cuddle pile Good luck OP  I know exactly what its like to have that breakdown moment and ask for help  You got this  The downside is the good thing to me lol  I don't have much of a life  MMOs sorta help with that I have no friends Gotta have balance  P  A lot of MMOs now a days are pretty casual friendly though  Not as much grind as the old days Sure  check out page 48 table 1 and page 50  figure 1    http   www dartmouth edu  jskinner documents ChandraSkinnerTechGrowth3 20 11 pdf  Then take into account what they cite at the bottom of page 5   '   Garber and Skinner  2008  found that  over time  U S  life expectancy growth has lagged behind a sample of 5 benchmark European countries  And

mean to insult anyone and I'm sorry if I made anyone feel bad     It's true  I've god kinda weird point of view on these things in general and starting by just seeking help is a huge step  too     Thank you for reading Thank you  It's nice to know I'm not alone in feeling the way I do  even when it is such a lonely place to be  I wish you the best in this new year and I hope that it gets easier for everyone who feels this way  No  you dont  Plenty of trans people never have any surgery  You don't do anything to "become" trans you just are  Being transgender just means you feel like you were born in the wrong sex's body in most cases  "I wish I had been born a pretty girl" seems pretty obvious to me  I'm an eighteen year old trans girl who started hormones a few months ago and doesn't really do penetrative sex    THe pickle jar is a joke  Trans women take an anti adrogen that causes salt cravings if they are on hormone replacement therapy My major is Management Information Systems and hopefully I can obtain my degree in another 2 years   Good luck to your goals as well  I've tried learning guitar myself but I'm not much of the musician  Good luck to you as well  It's definitely a good goal to start eating more healthy  I know for myself I should definitely completely cut out fast food and cut down on eating out  That would be too straightforward  I want to give a sarcastic or kinda cool reply    Thanks  Hugs to you   Predators are truly evil  and you didn't deserve that wooowwww I'm actually in this same situation except she didn't even respond to me when I said happy new year loooool   pls kill me  This really made me think about it  I'm accepting my self in a certain way  even that inferiority  as long as it's not stoping me from living  I think I just answered myself  that I should really find some help     Thank you I always set goals to loose weight but I loose motivation  I would love to get a trainer but I just don't got the money   But good luck to your goals Before I start  here is a search on pubmed for mindfulness  I just want you to see how much research in this area is exploding  https   www ncbi nlm nih gov pubmed  term mindfulness  Its called dissociation when its unwilled  harmful  and misunderstood and called mindfulness when it is initiated  beneficial  and understood  At least this is what it seemed to me  I went through some unique circumstances that left me dissociated and perhaps I am still a bit so but it is enjoyable rather than disturbing   Unfortunately  mindfulness is really a subsection of meditation  Which means its quite difficult to find good info on because of ten thousand years of cryptic motherfuckers accidentally obscuring things  If you are interested  here are the better resources I've found

every other resource is incredibly cryptic and unclear from what I found  Really off putting and kept me from pursuing it for a long time    Let me be clear   this doesn't stop the dissociation  I never found a way to do that  It just changes your perception of it  However  perception is reality and dissociation is no longer a problem for me   The reality is that you ARE a spectator to your emotions  If you can get that out of your head then thats all well and good and you won't need to pursue mindfulness  My anxiety riddled mind hyperfocuses on anything that bothers me and therefore the only path was through it   Anxiety medications are effective but the side effects can disturb your quality of life  That doesn't mean I am against them  You can be too distressed to pursue effective solutions to your problems  Popping a pill to fix that so that you can actually do so is wise  as long as you don't view them as a permanent solution if other remedies are possible  Take the medicine  feel better  work on yourself and your problems  handle them  come off the medications Are your parents irrational  Can't you present a case  and reach some sort of compromise  I'm not sure what they could say that you couldn't find an easy solution for "Hey  neighbor  Seems one of your guests took a toll on my garage door last night  Can I trouble you to hose it down today " So even having non

va vs non va  In addition  the VA loads many public health initiatives into their costs   For example  the overwhelming majority of providers in the US are trained by the VA   They are one of the biggest clinical research entities ever known to humanity   Responsible for developments such as the pace maker   2  You claim most US citizens can just switch health insurance providers without impediment   This is not not true  it usually requires they also switch their job   3  You claim the worst plans are health exchange plans   Most expensive and least effective     Link    I suppose

Honestly  I think this is an issue that needs to be spoken about more  You'll have to figure out if you can stand being miserable with your bf for what could be years while you cheat and possibly feel guilty or if you want to move out and find a cheaper place    Personally  I think life's too short to be miserable and both you and this guy deserve better  But that's just my opinion  Good luck Go to a psychologist Good work  asking for help is often one of the most difficult steps to take and is definitely a sign of strength    Don't know if this helps  but remember that parenthood is a joint effort  There might be certain things you can't handle right now with your 1 year old that your husband can  but isn't that a good thing if you think about it  You helping each other out  There will be things only you can handle in the future    And 1 year olds are difficult  They can be monsters  I don't know a single parent with a 1 year old  especially not the first one  that rides on pink fluffy clouds  so to speak    They all love their kids  but they all say it's "sooooo goooood to finally get out for a while"  Honestly is it that much better to be the 25 year old creep  I don't feel it is  I mean idk You'll only get lucky if you put yourself out there    onto some roads I thought superstitions have no logic to them I was thinking starting young would be better since I don't have children or a SO   sure might not know enough at a young age but by the time I'm older I might not be able to do it thanks  Got to be a homeless shelter somewhere nearby  Find it and take him there  This guy is not your responsibility  The shelter will have resources and a case worker to get him back on his feet  You can't do this and your relationship with your gf and child will suffer if you continue to try and "help" him  Look at it this way  how much has he changed in the last month  Probably not much  Do you see yourself taking care of this grown man for another month  Another year  At this point you are enabling him  He needs to take care of himself  They rarely compromise on things  Im at the point where im just conditioned to not even bother planning my weekend because i know they would not let me go out  Then my mom has the audacity to ask why i dont have friends or know how to dance   I do not have bipolar or mania  but I do have adjustment disorder with anxiety and depression that is easily triggered by my environment   The first telltale sign that things are really bad and I will need help is the feeling you described where the tears just wouldn't come  You want to cry but you can't  You stop crying  It's like there is an abyss between me and my ability to express despair   I am so glad you are getting a referral  Please do not let anyone  including yourself  talk you out of getting the help you need  Please do not falsely frame yourself as a failure or as a weak person  You are the strongest person  and have faced more odds than anyone who judges you could ever imagine   You may need hospitalization  Accept this  Accept that it can be a good thing  that you may get a break from all of the outside stressors in your life that are exacerbating an internal issue you are having  You cannot afford the real estate in your mind to worry about what anyone will say in regard to you getting treatment  People can be selfish and might say selfish things   But this is a fire that needs to be addressed now so that you don't burn down later   You have to survive right now in order to thrive later  And loving people is about making sure they survive in the hard times   There are times when you simply must look out for yourself if you want any ability to look after anyone else in the future  This may very well be one of those times  Do not be ashamed and do not consider this a failure  The is no such thing as failure by seeking out a means to succeed    It may take a while  and a doctor  to figure out if the hormonal changes of motherhood are playing a role in exacerbating a pre existing issue  Please know that you are not alone  this is common and you are not failing or weak   You are loved and you are important  You deserve to be well  I send you soothing thoughts and strength   I have been where you are let me tell you  I am strong  I sought help no matter what anyone said about me "abandoning them" or "sharing my private life" or "making them look bad"    fuck that  Get help and get better  You deserve to find peace and recover may I ask whats so bad about telling him  Long distance isnt a death sentence I started at like 63 kg early 2016  Half assed going to gym and didn't eat properly for shit  went up to around 66 kg  In september I started hitting the gym properly and followed the "diet" I described above and I'm currently at 78 79 kg with not too much fat gain  I didn't eat TOO much so this was pretty much a clean bulk  could have eaten way more and added more fat and muscle but I prefer staying relatively lean    I used to be even skinnier  58 kg 1 8m  so trust me I know how it feels to be skinny and thinking you can never put on weight  Your result could be better or worse than mine but as long as you focus on eating  eating and eating in addition to hitting the gym 3 times a week minimum you will not stay skinny  I promise you Does it help if I lift too That's   not a very good experiment  which is why I didn't include it   Soft drinks are not   really buffered in conditions for optimal enzyme activity   The fact that they used soda instead of aspartame water solution for that experiment is strange The answer is simple friend  I have no doubt in my head that you heard her voice  and the fact that you heard it doesn't make you crazy  Anywhere from 5  28  of the population are like you  You want to know what's crazy though  The fact that you are letting that voice controll you  but it's still fine  and there are many ways to overcome it    Could this be souls being linked  Possibly  I don't have much experience in this field  but anything is possible friend  I highly recommend seeing a psychiatrist  They know you aren't crazy  and they can help you learn ways to not let her voice control you  They may also prescribe medication  to help you take back your mind  and use it for yourself  without her voice dominating everything you do  Medication is definitely the best route for you here  What you heard was very real  You aren't crazy  A psychiatrist can help  I have faith in you OP  You've got this    Feel free to PM me if you have any questions People are different  if you can be content  it doesn't mean anybody can become content all of a sudden Because then the party will be very tedious  At least that's how it would be for me  I attribute the amount of books to self publishing being easier than ever and people tapping into a new way for some quick money How do you eat someone out and not get laid Have you gone over and asked them to be quieter  How would they know they are annoying you if you never say anything I found that depression anxiety caused much more of a loss of brain function  and that using medication  presently Wellbutrin  Lexapro  Ritalin  b vitamins  made my brain much faster  as i could "see through the fog" mich better  Also  depression made makes it harder to remember things  when i started medication it felt like i had access to memories again   The meds you take shouldn't be at a level to make everyrhing "perfect " that doesn't exist and is when you're losing your mind  i feel like   They let you function on a basic level much better  so you can do the work in your life to feel better long term You sound smart  Id hangout with you  Studying formal grammar can help you learn the structure of language  and that can help anyone think more logically in general  I recommend starting with learning all the rules for punctuation  and then different sentence structure types  Sentence diagramming is great for this    Also  just be patient with yourself  and focus on getting your ideas out  not on the way you talk  Don't try to sound formal  and just be yourself  The listener can tell  and they appreciate you being genuine I love my kid and my husband dearly but we certainly have a strong willed and stubborn child  It's been a struggle in itself just learning how to teach him that he won't get his way all the time  My husband has the patience of Job to be able to deal with my shortcomings and mental illness and a stubborn child  I admire him for that  Parenting is certainly one of the most difficult things we have been through as a couple and I can't imagine doing it with anyone else  I just hope I'm making the right move and that it will get easier from here well he probably still is kissless he only ate her out lmaoIdk man  My parents were pretty strict when I was growing up too  and I completely relied on them for everything  They are usually somewhat rational  so they would present their reasons  and I would let them know why their reasons weren't flawed  If that didn't do it  I would tell them that they are being emotional instead of logical  and I can't support their view  Then I would just do it  Realistically  they want me to be happy  They aren't going to do anything that descreases the quality of my life when I can't support their delusions  I would just go for it  What are they really going to do  You're a fucking adult  Unless you're a complete shithead  they should have nothing to worry about  Now we just laugh about the times I went to parties I wasn't supposed to go to  Go for it I learned to read tabs there's a site that has all the cheat sheets on how to play songs  and just went from there and for piano I just synthenesia My current boyfriend told me just before I left and we started dating  we didn't see each other for 2 months and I am so glad he did  almost 7 years later and we are together   With 5years long distance  You have nothing to lose  just win Or you get a boyfriend and you can move on You should do it before you go and in person   Yeah  he's looking for sex  I'm not nearly as old as he is and I've got literally nothing in common with an 18 year old   except we could have sex  Can you see yourself hooking up with an old guy like this  His body and mannerisms will be way different than guys your age or in their 20's  I'd burn the business card and avoid that store like the plague  Maybe  I mean its not like i do drugs but still my parents are probably not like yours though so rationality wont matter its just authority and power imo  They probably think "my house  my rules" regardless of logic Try out certain nootropics to help improve your forgetfulness  slow it down   No mostly just no response So sorry   Amazing how empty love gone makes one feel   Just experiencing that myself   Met a woman  online   Yet strongest connection I have ever felt   Though I expressed caring and affection in many ways  I never told her I loved her   Now I know that lack of expression of Love made her doubt me    and  on her own  reconsider our relationship   She has moved on    and I hope I have learned something valuable  as you have learned   Hoping this emptiness gets easier to live with    I know I won't find another love this strong   Here's hoping you will   Don't you stop hoping and looking  I'm not  But he doesn't want to leave the situation  either  He wants to stay in the apt and stay in the reationship with me  even though he knows I cheated on him and tried to leave him  he doesnt careI wouldn't say your point of view is weird  it's actually common because there is still such a stigma around seeking help for mental health problems   but it's frustrating for me as a therapist  I hope you do consider seeking help  you'd be a good candidate and you could start feeling better soon  Unless you plan on committing a bunch of murders  I don't see any reason why someone having your DNA would cause you any problems  Cats are dumb This is actually really helpful for me  Thank you  Well my mom is crazy religious and has literally never partied in her life  I was suspended for selling weed right when I started high school  so obviously my parents were refusing me for good reasons  Ultimately  I did really well in school  so what are they going to do  They aren't going to pay for my school  Fine  if you want to fuck up my future to prove a point it's on you  It's not going to happen  Just go  Their worries are not justified  and maybe you need to show them that  As a momma to a 14 month old    your husband needs to chill  Taking care of yourself first IS taking care of your baby  That has to happen before anything else is possible   Also  if by some slim chance you're in the Detroit metro area  I'll sit for you so you can catch a break Please help her  If someone's being hurt in a situation like this  you should never stay silent  She's scared and doesn't know how to get out of her abusive relationship  that's why she didn't want to get the police involved  I would call them and let them know everything that happened  plus you've got pictures to show the condition she was in  Please call for help  don't let her suffer in silence  She might be seriously injured or may die if she has no one to run to next time he gets violent  If you feel uncomfortable staying in their house then you should consider leaving This   You can buy your own place wherever   You'll have an amazing resume that would be virtually second to none  virtually allowing you to get a job in management  but not a CEO position   So you'll be a leader  but feel far less overwhelmed  Clear your mind  1  Find a room where you won't be disturbed for at least 10 minutes   2  Sit down  close your eyes and stop thinking   If a thought enters your head phase it out   You should be focusing on your breathing and heart rate   Both should be steady and normal   When you can get your heart rate steady and normal  this is your "natural" state   3  Do this exercise for 10 minutes any chance you get   Have you ever noticed that when you are anxious your breathing and heart rate starts to speed up and become irregular   This is the state of anxiety   When you are confident and feel like you are at your best or you really don't care  your heart rate is relaxed and normal   Stop thinking so much   Focus on your heart rate and breathing   When you do feel your heart rate and breathing start to speed up  become aware of it and start to slow it down back to normal   A good way to do is to stop thinking and when you take action  Approach people because you want to see what happens  not necessarily to get them to like you   Sometimes you'll be shocked at how well people respond to you     Most people want to be with people who they can sit in the room  not say a word  and still enjoy each others company   Sounds weird  but if you notice  the friends you may have  you really don't need to entertain them so much   You don't need to impress them   Your presence is good enough  You may feel the same way about certain people   I hope this helped They are Hispanic teenagers  Do you really think that they don't know  what "Build the Wall" means  Especially to them and potentially members of their family   Did you not read the OP's problem which is that  she has been asked to talk to them about specific bad behavior   That kind of means that it's not an accusation  but rather a fact that directly caused this particular issue to be brought up  How would you sugar coat this  pray tell At least he  has  friends   Unless your ex was abusive  I don't see any reason why people you know should cut them out of their lives just because your relationship didn't work out  This has been the hardest thing I've ever decided to do  I really appreciate your support and your kindness  It means so much to hear this even from a stranger  Thank you I'm glad  It may have been stated a little harshly  but combatting stigma against mental illness is something I'm very passionate about  No one should have to suffer because think they "should" be able to handle something  THIS IS MY BROTHER  NOT PEOPLE I KNOW  I think you'd do best to stick in there for the moment  as it very much sounds like it's something to do with his life that's making him uncomfortable  I don't think it would be you  as unless you've gone under a very drastic change in between about 2 years ago and a year and a half ago  it's probably something to do with his life  This does seem very typical of him being nervous of something  It's usually a bit more obvious when it's their SO   You should also consider the possibility you are exactly what's holding him together  That you're the strand that keeps him sane  Keeps him breathing  Helps him get up in the morning  My girlfriend has very low self esteem due to the fact that she has had more than 15 bad dating experiences  being a girl with a large cup size in a bad part of town  Which sadly  to scummy guys who'll drop you in a second  is the only pre requisite for a glorified one night stand  She thinks she's a burden to me because that's how her brain has trained her to think of herself  but really she's everything that's pure in my life  You could well be his angel  but he's having a lot of trouble expressing it properly to you  as I sometimes do  because of outside stress  During exam times or any big ol' stressful event like that  those are the time's I've come close to breaking up  despite her being my lifeline  Just don't give up on him  you might not know the whole story of why he's upset From your previous post I'm going to assume you met him online and haven't met in person   so that's how I'm going to approach this   Use your head and ask yourself what do you really know about him   Until you actually meet  your only talking to a resume or a highlight of what he wants you to know   This guy doesn't love you   If he did he would be making a serious effort to physically spend time with you   A guy that loves you would work on helping you through your body issues  not asking about your weight  and demanding nudes     As far as the swinging  nothing is wrong with it provided your relationship is stable and healthy   However  anytime you bring others into a  relationship there are serious risks that have to be taken into account  Clear rules and boundaries need to be set up   Your boyfriend is  showing a clear lack of boundaries   Hold your ground and don't let him bully you into sending nudes   He's heavily into the swing scene   What's going to stop him from sharing what you send him   What's stopping him from finding a side girl to send his dick to   The fact that hes fantasizing heavily about swingers is disrespectful because hes telling you he wants to fuck another girl   Would he be cool if you said you had a neighbor that wanted to fuck you   I'm not gonna tell you to leave him or stay   That's your personal choice  but know that you deserve a healthy relationship with someone who's eyes are only upon you and will respect your personal boundaries    Don't we allI don't know  I just can't bring myself to do it over the phone  I feel like it's something we have to talk about in person  I don't even know why  and I know it's stupid  How does it affect you though  if your brother goes to the same party as your ex  Are you worried they are going to hook up  Yup  High school never ends  as they say I can't do it before I go  I leave early tomorrow morning and have no way of seeing him today  And he's a really good friend  so I have that to lose if he says no  Have you seen him to confirm if he is sick or not  If he isn't  I would stick to telling her that  You never actually saw him smoking the joint so you can't prove it's his  Did whoever it was smoke it inside  Because damn near the whole house would reek of weed  Seems kind of stupid to me to smoke a joint in someone else's house  who I gather probably doesn't smoke weed and will definitely smell it  Therefore they will handle it and you wouldn't need to I'm more afraid of talking to people than seeking help  so I will solve 2 problems at once  Thank you  I will find someone to help me  you've just got a point for making someone realise seeking help is inevitable and important One way to deal with this problem is to avoid groups and just hang out one on one     By the way  part of the reason for this phenomenon is that a large percentage of people  starting from a young age  are completely obsessed with popularity and spend most of their waking hours trying to be popular     I myself find it hard to spend much time thinking over what clothes to wear and buy  which people I am better off being seen with  which people I should avoid  and so on   I tend to wear what's comfortable and spend time with people I like regardless of their social standing   I would guess a lot of the people here are like that which is part of the reason they are unpopular       Yes and no  While sexism is very much alive among Caucasian males  cultural norms are different between cultural groups  As a result  highlighting certain issues or concerns to play to those differences can make for more effective communication and better results   Your suggestion is little like saying  "When giving a talk to people from the middle east  be sure to give them a thumbs up to show things are good " Which is nice  until you realize that the thumbs up gesture is the same as flipping them off in many countries over there  yikes I haven't seen him confirm he's sick he said he has nausea  I did confirm it was smoked because there is ash on the deck and no one smokes in my family Congratulations and thank you for fighting yourself  This is a start  and it's not necessarily going to be an upward trend all the way  but remember that now you have the collective trust and empathy of many of us behind you as well  Leverage that energy  and use it to pull yourself up now and push yourself up later when your feet are on the ground but you want that boost of self love   Place your needs at the center of your universe while you push through this  You'll come to realize how important and valuable you are as you progress   Much love and solidarity  OP    Well  that's 3 more non bot matches than I've gotten in years I agree that most of us here would give 100  in a relationship while I can read tabs but I still can't play them because I don't have the skilldo you see her at something in day to day life  Because if so  you should just not message her at all  If she wants to get back together she will come to you right What's your point  I was a complete FA and a KHV until I did that   3 matches bro  Get a match a day like you're doing  and you'll find someone in 2017  Maybe  Could happen  Worth a shot  Maybe not Where is he now  If you can  go find him and confront him about it  See if he looks high or smells like weed  If that's not possible or you don't want to confront him  tell your parents  That's really a rude thing to do to smoke in someone else's house who's letting you stay there  and just leave your mess everywhere  dont do it for the women  do it for yourselfNot at all  My brother's GF and my ex are friends  I just hate that he would choose to go with them instead of coming to celebrate with his family  his blood  me  I introduced them all to each other  and hes hanging out with the new bf of my ex as well  doesn't that scream "traitor " Almost every COD game has a nonexistent player base on PC  simply because most PC players don't like the games  Head on over to r pcmasterrace and ask around there for game recommendations  Steam still has the winter sale going on so you can still get some classic games for cheap It's probably because you have no bigger goals in life  You're living the day to day and just floating through life with no direction  Maybe I'm wrong  but that's what I'm getting Just do it so you don't end up second guessing yourself for the rest of your life  Don't play the "what if" game with yourself  it'll drive you crazy  Even if you get rejected  at least you'll know where you stand  and there should be no regrets  because you gave it a shot You win NYEI hate that shit so much  How is ignoring someone a good solution for anything  Fuck her  1  Change how the board meetings are held or where they're held  be creative  you're 20 and have a very profitable business  figure it out    2  Take someone with you  Or research where you are going and find something unique that area has to offer  plan accordingly    3  Want to take longer holidays  Find someone whom you trust  whom is qualified to step in as you  not a yes man  Pay them well treat them with respect     4  Human resources department    5    6  See  4    7  Invest in people  Pay them well make it clear on expectations  don't hover over them but don't be a ghost either  keep tabs and if you see something you don't like  say something and show them how you would like it done   8  You're the man at the top act that way  it seems to me you try and do everything yourself  Having it done your way is very different from just doing it yourself  You got to where you are by being creative and getting what you want by working your ass off  you need to continue doing this if you want to grow    The worst thing you can do is nothing  go get it   Best of luck     Do you know what makes successful people successful  No  it's not money or influence  What makes them successful is the fact that they can fall flat on their face  break every facial bone possible  get back up and ram whatever it is again face first  Also  you didn't fail  you just didn't succeed  Failure is when you don't try   you tried  Pick yourself up  brush yourself off  learn from your mistakes and prepare yourself for the next face bash    When are most people returning to work after the holidays  I was never a party guy or club guy  I've been to them usually dragged by my best friend but I always felt out of place  It also didn't help that he was getting literally groped by women and Im basically ignored This is fuckin brutal and fucked up  But i still gotta ask  are you fat  Or why are so repulsive Yeah that's very true and a very good outlook on life  And by no means am I upset with my situation i n life in general  I'm actually pretty happy  I just wish I wasn't so bad with dealing with people haha   People are all around you    use them as practice   When you go into a store  and you see a cute cashier  flirt with her   Not because you want to get her  but because you want to practice your confidence with meeting new people   It's gonna be weird at first but if you do it enough times  you'll get use to it   If you do this to  let's say  100 people a month  that's only about a little over 3 people a day   you may bump into one of them outside their job or wherever you flirted with them   If she recognizes you  she may walk up to you and talk to you   Remember that these people are not in a vacuum    they do have a life outside that specific place you've seen them   Imagine if out of those 100 people you flirted with  7 of them gave you their number another day   You hung out with 7  of  them   It's only 7  success but people usually can only give their attention to a handful of people at a time   If you're allowed to date  you have 7 potential dates   You mentioned that you are learning about Entrepreneurship   A book I highly recommend is Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki   Don't borrow that book    buy it   If you lose it or lend it to someone  buy yourself another copy   That book is a life changer   You will get a good solid foundation of how money and business works   I hope this helped Read up on ADD or ADHD  sounds familiarI completely disagree  If he's only into minors  that's not something that you should accept or do things that will amplify it  like going with him to your brother's games    If he's befriending these young guys and then they're becoming uncomfortable and trying to leave him  that seems to me he's trying to use friendship as a way to coax them into something they're uncomfortable with   This is a tough situation  and I honestly don't know what I would do in this case  If he dated someone who was 17  I would probably let that slide  but when he is into people as young as 15 and as young as your brother  that's not good  It's illegal  they are not old enough to consent  and it could lead to a manipulative relationship   It's definitely easier said than done  but I think you should ask him about it and whether or not he's into younger guys  He probably can't help who he's into  but that doesn't make it right  If you feel comfortable doing it  try to be there to support him with fighting those urges   Best of luck to you Why don't you find a successor  Somebody you know very well and someone you can trust and leave the business to him  Or the other choice is like the previous comments cash your chips and go home  But what do i know i'm just an 18 year old   Thanks  That sounds amazing  I think I am 22 and currently around 65 kg  I will definitely follow your advice  But I still don't understand the point of going gym  I have already heard that skinny people should also go to gym before you will suggest that     But I don't want to gain muscles  it's not a crime if you don't want to be muscular   I am also not fat at all anywhere  Also if I am correct  you lose lot of calories and burn fat by going gym  Doesn't I want more fat in my body  Am I missing anything You friends probably did care about you  but they were unsure of what to do   They may have thought you wanted space since they probably noticed you actively trying to avoid them   You can still have a fresh start too   24 is not that old   I'm sorry you had to go through that  but you can become a stronger person from it   Also  some of those happy couples probably were not even happy   My one friend spent New Year's Eve with a guy she met on Tinder just so she could post a photo on Instagram of her kissing someone at midnight   She will probably never see this guy again   I know it's hard  but you just have to keep trying if you want a partner   If not  it can get better the older you get   I made peace with being forever alone relationship wise   I have good friends so I hang with them when I get lonely  I just want to share with you  I did a master's degree in biology and never landed a job in my field  however  things I learned while doing "intellectual bulimia" as you put it  did serve me well later on in life  be it only when I changed domain for a trade job  that pays well    when the kids I was studying with would give me enormous praise for my math and language skills  and my general culture so to speak  Well  at one point  their attitude towards me ended up making me feel uncomfortable of course  and through such situations  they unexpectedly taught me something that my long years of university never brought me even close to learning   humility  My point being that you probably don't need to come across as intelligent if you are and you know it yourself   unless it is absolutely necessary for you to polish your soft skills in order to land a position belong to a particular group   in which case you simply need practice  and some form of mentorship  find brilliant speakers on youtube and emulate them  Np  Moderators are just people who started the subreddit  A mod can make others mods if they choose   Mods administrate the subreddit  Fuck  this puts a lot of the things I see on this sub into perspective    Happy new year  buddy  Everyone has something that they're interested in  you just haven't found it yet and that's fine  When I was 21  I was working as a janitor and had absolutely no direction whatsoever  I had no idea what I was going to do with my life  nothing interested me  I worked a job that I hated because it paid well but I was still miserable  I didn't find what I wanted to do until early in 2016  Patience my friend  I don't mean patience as in be lazy  I mean  sometimes you have to do what you can and let the universe do the rest  Explore  get out and try new things  meet new people  Dive into a subject that you never considered before  There's so much out there in the world to find    Also  I'll throw this out there just in case it ends up being helpful or interesting  I am a life coach and have helped people who lack direction and clarity  I'd be more than happy and willing to talk to you and help you with this if it's something you'd be interested in and willing to try  Don't hesitate to reach out if you want to talk  Aw  that's sad   You should try and get out more   You deserve to exist too   You are welcome in public   Happy New Year That was cool of your professor   Sometimes   people see the true potential in others and understand that life happens and give a break where it's needed  Well  I run a practice where people pay  50 for a 10 15 minute consultation where I offer tough love  They must really  really value it  Not sure it's wise to assume everyone feels like you on this topic  You need to relax My husband hasn't done anything to warrant a "chill"  He works in the hospital and knows first hand what happens when someone commits themselves for suicide watch  He has been very supportive and if I still feel I need to go in he agrees that I should go and get better  He just wants me to know exactly what to expect from that decision should it have been the route I chose to take  He has never told me or given me any reason to think he finds me selfish or inadequate of caring for our child  He understands my illness is debilitating at times and that sometimes I need more help than others and gives me all the love and care I could ask for  He wants me to get help and together we agree that giving myself some time to recuperate and think about what exactly I need for myself and what I really want is the best choice  This is my decision alone  he is merely there to give me insight and support   I appreciate your support and offer but i do not feel my husband is in any way in the wrong  Consider a greyhound  They are actually couch potatoes    I wouldn't recommend a small terrier breed of dog as they are bred to be high energy and can be very stubborn  Working dogs such as border collies are also a poor choice for apartments  Op taught me that "wang" can be used as a verb  or was it an adjective   Anyway  I am so totally going to start using this word  Br Are you dealing with depression   You don't have to answer if that's too personal Wow  you sound really good I can see what you mean by projecting  If my mom doesn't want divorce  I wouldn't want to upset her  Thanks for the advice Thank you for your kind words of encouragement and support  You experienced an abusive relationship for some time  Be patient with yourself  Do things you were scared to do   continue to get rid of her things  Take back the music you liked that you associate with her   take back anything that you want to be a part of yourself and make it yours  Try to meet people who care about you   real friends    Ultimately realize that what you experienced was someone hurting you for years   if someone had been beating you every day for years then you'd have some bruises and injuries that would need to physically heal  Let yourself emotionally heal and realize it will take time  Don't lay on additional stress by feel bad for being stressed    Stay strong  You got this person out of your life and you will only be stronger because of that  You're the captain of your ship again  If I understand your post correctly  you are not happy with your bf's lack of motivation and the fact that he smokes pot  He apparently doesn't care that this upsets you or you have not told him  Either way  you are both unhappy  You already cheated on him and would have left him if the other guy hadn't broken things off  If your bf really doesn't care that this happened  then he has some serious self esteem issues that need to be worked out  I don't see this ending well  Nowhere in your posts did you say you were staying with him out of love  Mostly pity and financial security  it seems like  If the two of you are fine with settling for each other and not being happy  then more power to you  It just doesn't sound like an ideal situation to me  In the chance you're not trolling  here's some advice   If you do not love Phil  end your relationship with Phil  Phil should be with someone who agrees with his lifestyle choices  You can't come in here  expect him to pay for the shit you want while at the same time telling him how to live his life   A healthy partnership is between two people who agree to terms that are mutually beneficial  If the guy wants to be high and play video games all day while still paying his portion of rent  and that doesn't work for you  then this is not a healthy partnership   1  If you're only keeping him around for his additional income  you are a bad person  2  You must learn to live within your means  If you cannot afford it  you cannot have it  3  If you want more in life  get the fuck up off your ass and go fucking earn it tbh its all because of my acne scars  Ever since I developed acne scarring I have been universally discriminated against and denied any fairness  I fucking hate everybody so much  I just went for a drive around town so I could flip off every person I saw  I have a pretty bad memory  probably not as bad as yours admittedly   but I realized not that long ago that sometimes there are some things you can't change and you'll have to work harder and create systems of organization and routines in order to function at the average level that most people are at  It sucks to have to work harder to do something that seems like everybody does easily  but you work with what you have  not with what you wish  Look into reminder apps for your phone  I set reminders for almost everything using Due on iOS   I have a white board right by my front door where I can leave notes to remind me of things before I leave my apartment  I take pictures of parking spaces so I don't forget where my car is  If you can't store your memory in your mind then you can work on finding ways to store it somewhere else  Wat My therapist has taught me so much over the past two years  but the most important thing she taught me was to be kind to myself  since I'm so much harder on myself than I would be to someone else in my situation  She taught me to acknowledge that I have some serious issues and that I fight those issues every day instead of giving up  To give myself the credit I deserve for attempting  even if I sometimes fail  To recognize that seeking help when I need it shows courage and resourcefulness  not weakness    Never think that you failed because you couldn't handle your BPD on your own  You  are  handling it on your own  You decided on your own that you need help  and you are taking the steps to get that help  You aren't a mental health professional  and you  can't  do it on your own without seeking assistance from one    Would you consider an accomplished athlete to be a failure because they used a personal trainer to coach them  and went to a nutritionist to find out what their body needed to perform at its best  If they get injured  would you expect them to forego physical therapy and pain medication  Would it make their successes any less "theirs" to rely on those with more knowledge to guide them      Your brain is just another body part that needs training and occasionally suffers injuries  There is no shame in seeking treatment   it shows that you're taking responsibility for your health  Do this for yourself  you need to stick around for your son and your husband  but you also need to stick around for YOU  You deserve the chance to watch your son grow up and to grow old together with your husband  and you deserve to be happy and healthy while you do it    Congratulations on your first step toward that future  Be kind and congratulate yourself as well  on this step and every step you take  Be compassionate with yourself when you falter  and give yourself credit for having the guts to keep going  Finally  remember that others like myself think you're brave and strong for fighting  even if you don't always see it that way  Aw  You're the best  I saved a pigeon from the mall  I bought one of those plastic fabric bags from marshalls and put him in there for the bus ride home  I thought it was a baby and couldn't fly yet  I put him in my bathroom for a few days  He pooped everywhere   I ended up taking him back to the mall and he flew back up to the ledge where I'm assuming he fell out of  Some of the other pigeons were kinda mean to him so I threw pennies at them until they left him alone  I watched for at least 2 hours  When I thought he would be ok  I left    I realized he probably would've been ok if I had just left him alone in the 1st place   My suggestion   take him back to where you found him or take him to an animal shelter   Good luck    You're awesome Stop Dude trust me it's all about how your present yourself Don't have low self esteem Have confidence in yourself When you wake up in the morning look at yourself in the mirror and be like " I am the baddest bitch there is"  Maybe High school girls are judgmental and date based on looks but trust me girls who goes to university don't rely on look  It's all about your personality confidence and how you present your self in general  He doesn't want to leave  he wants to stay in the apt with me and stay with me in a relationship  He doesnt have many friends  is high most of the time and has never really had a gf  Oh  your user made me think you were brazilian  Sry   Oh  you are so sweet  but my cousin shared his account with me already  And sharing your account is not so great for you  you need to change it from primary to sub  which means you can only access your own games when you are connected to PSN      You don't really have to play the previous Witcher games  90  of the characters are new  and the story is not too complicated  basically you are a monster hunter  for example  you speak with farmers  they tell you that a griffin killed their horses  you locate the griffin  fuck it up  then cut it's head off and show it to the farmers  and they give you wheat or some shit for reward  I think it's one of the best games currently on the PS4  Yeah I've been invited but have no one to go with i guess  Man that sucks hearing that good looking guys can get girls easily there Rough breakdown  Air O W HOU LAX   158 Car

dreams in life  Since you mention your parents I guess they are important to you and you want to make them proud again  Surprise them this year  Do things people do not expect from you  Use that money you used for weed to help people or travel  Always remember if you do not start now    you never will  If the life you have right now is not going the way you like it  Change it  Thank you so much  It's so hard to remember that self care doesn't always mean selfishness and that I need to mean something to myself as well as to those around me  this is one of those times where I need to be reminded the most  You are the issue but it's an easy fix   You have what I call automatic rejection syndrome   You think people are going to automatically reject you   If you dress different and you like the way you dress  fuck it    that's what you like   If you own it  people will have to accept the fact that that's what you like if they're going to be with you   People love music   If you are a musician  that may mean you think different to them too   Look at the millions of people who faint over musicians   Not saying that people will faint over you  but you may win them over because you have a skill that a lot of people don't have   If you're good  that may get females checking you out   You don't really need similar interest to people  but you need to find similarities that you can connect with with certain people   You don't need to find people who dress like you or play music like you  but you can make friend with people because the both of you may learn something from one another   One person may know how to draw or write short stories   Another person may fix cars   Another person may know how to sculpt   The four of you may become friends because one fixed your car at a good price   The other became your friend because they draw a comic strip that you like in the school paper   Another one may have did a sculpture of Captain America   You may have similarities that each one of you want to meet new friends and this is what bought you together   You gotta be okay with yourself before you can get others to accept you   It sounds like a cliche  but it's true   You can find like minded people in forums or other subreddits   If you're into entrepreneurship  you may want to join a forum or a subreddit with people with similar interest   You may not meet them in person but at least you can communicate with people who think like you   A book I highly recommend for entrepreneurship is Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki   It changed my life in a big way   I hope this helped Your first mistake is having T MobileIf you're wanting to get into web design  you're going to have to buy a PC regardless  The great thing about PC gaming is that you can always upgrade components as money comes along where as with console gaming if you want something better  you have to buy a new console outright  Check out  r buildapc if you want some information on PC building  Just my two cents Probably better not to use that condom in your wallet  The one you put there just in case when you were fifteen Holy Fuck at least let him enjoy his first day as a non virgin Hey thanks man  that's the major thing I'm trying to weigh out  But like I said thanks for your time and advice  I really appreciate it    Yes and no  You have a lot more freedom after high school  but you also have more responsibility  People remain about the same  but you have the ability to pick where you want to be more effectively   You aren't forced to go to one school and spend time with those limited people  Instead  you have to decide what scene you want to be in and see who is there  If you don't like the scene  change it    College is also nothing like high school  Everyone self selects into the classes  which means generally you get people with fairly compatible motivations for being there  A class full of history students  are all paying to sit in that seat  by choice   So  if you like history  them being there in that seat is a good sign you have something in common  Also  campus is larger so it isn't like you run into the same clump of people everywhere  Haha  I can understand your hostility  Not sure this is the best way to relieve it though  I would suggest a smallish dog  Not a terrier but like a pug mix or a chihchi mix  I would even suggest a senior dog that doesn't have issues walking  I have no idea if you live in a space with tons of stairs  Set aside a time to cry and let it all out   I do this when I absolutely have to be productive in the moment   For example  I tell myself  "I don't have time for emotions until  insert time " and I make sure I follow through with it   I wouldn't advise doing this frequently  however It has helped me get through some days I think he meant  she was way more beautiful and elegant than Op could realistically expect in this life Hostile  No  not at all  So what is your field in I get this  It's one of the most annoying and conflicting things I've ever felt   I've also felt the opposite   this guy was everything I thought I was into  But I couldn't get feelings for him This post has been

 Please  contact the moderators of this subreddit   message compose  to  r offmychest  if you have any questions or concerns  Thanks bro But there is always this feeling of "maybe they are waiting for ME to send them a message   I used to think just like you    and I would get ignored all the time  The worst was when   I'd wish someone a happy birthday on facebook and they wouldn't rerspond to me and actually respond to everyone else     But yeah you don't need that in your life  i'm not going to tell you that you're better alone but it's better than thinking that you actually have friends   Do not give suicide suggestions to people here Thanks    Good for you  I'm confident that you will benefit from talking it over with a trained professional  Please let me know if I can be of further assistance  You developed lung cancer at 25 years from smoking  Yeah def sounds shady  I've seen one case of someone less than 30 getting lung cancer with smoking but it was secondary to abestosis with mesothelioloma but that was a 3rd word country and the dude was sleeping on it  I find this hard to believe I can understand how that could be super frustrating and irritating  Your issue is somewhat unique in that this is a rational response to an actual problem  Talking about this with someone with whom you have a good therapeutic rapport can help you develop healthier or more effective coping skills     You may also explore the possibility of a referral to a dermatologist or other specialist to see if there re any cosmetic options for you to help remedy the problem    The sidebar has a link to the international and national suicide hotline numbers  What do you think I guess you saying that he looked at you "coolly" and said you need to know what you're getting into did not make him sound supportive  Especially since you basically had to breakdown and confess this to him  Idk  But I am glad he's supportive and wish you all the best   hope that you have a wonderful recovery Couldn't of said it any better  We've been trying our best to get him somewhere to live  He has another week to find a place or somewhere to go or we have to let him go as we've tried our best with him  He's rang up many places but no luck yet  We have also asked many friends to keep a look out too  He's only 18  Thanks for your input  Wat   I don't speak Portuguese  Do you know anyone that has gone to rebab   What makes you think they work   They don't   I'm afraid you have selected the most expensive and least effective method   Simply white knuckling it works just as well    I really  really want to see people getting the help they need  so strongly recommend listening to the others here   And don't take my word for it  please research and Google rehab success rates    as published by anyone other than a rehab  Its not stupid  Please stop beating yourself up over this  You really should be more positive and confident in your relationship with him  The last thing you want to do is create a self fulfilling prophecy  Its like when you dont want a certain thing to happen  but your actions inevitably end up creating the exact thing you didnt want    Take a deep breath  realize that what you feel is amazing  someone makes you feel like walking on air  Even if he doesnt reciprocate its still amazing that youre capable of such emotion  And realistically if it doesnt work out  your friendship SHOULD survive unless hes immature  If it doesnt go the way you want it to  dont despair  its gonna suck for a little bit but now you know that feeling is possible  someone else will come by and make you feel that again if thats whats meant to be  As long as you follow some basic health hygiene you'll be fine   Try corn as a food or bird seed  FYI town pigeons will eat human vomit  eeew I know and not suggesting you puke up for it but they will eat shit thats why they're such good breeders  samePeople grow apart  it's normal and natural  I have had loads of friends sort of "float" away  and I've drifted away from other friends  too  That's life  Clinging to friendships that are past their expiration date can often do more damage than good Ask friends for a recommendation on dentists   They will lead you to a good one    The cleaning is a hassle but better than the alternative of unbelievable pain from rotting teeth   Good job on flossing and brushing regularly   Unless you constantly eat sweets and drink  soda it probably won't be that bad This sub has people that have never been in a relationship or don't have friends or both   Every once in a while we get a "I wanna die" thread   I guess you get the impression that forveralone comes from rage comic but no it's not a joke How old are you   Won't be awkward for long  just see them as another person  they grounded you because they want you to learn your lesson  but mostly because they love you  They are your parents and not some police officers   Maybe your dad is making the jokes to lighten the tension  just act normal and have a laugh with him Talking just doesn't fix the issue  If I am still being discriminated against I am going to get upset about it   Acne scars are permanent  I have already spent thousands of dollars and years trying to treat them  I feel society has offered me the option to clean other peoples shit from a toilet bowl or starve to death  No matter what I say  how hard I work  or what I do that will never change  There is no incentive for me to work hard or cooperate with anyone because I will be relegated to the bottom for something I have no control over  I am so sorry   so sorry   Hugs to you   If I was you I'd just do the subject again next year if I failed  basically you'll have twice as much time to learn the content and hopefully get a great grade the next time you do it   I've been to uni for a lot of years now and the biggest thing I found out is the people who do the best  are the hard workers  I've met a lot of smart people in my time studying  and a lot of them bail out  a lot stay also  but the ones who really understand the topic  who really do well  are the people who wasn't specifically smart  but who put the effort in   I believe you should stop feeling like an idiot  as you've done great getting this far  it sounds you may be slower in the uptake  but to be great at any subject it's that hard work that you've been doing to get there   I don't think you should sell yourself short here  almost everyone I know of has failed at least 1 to 2 subjects at uni  myself included   Unless you start feeling the whole degree to be too overbearing  I'd say you're probably just in one of those difficult subjects due to this   Even the very good students are struggling and complaining about lack of time and might just need a bit more time on it    If possible it might be worth talking to the topic coordinator and seeing if theres any help or ideas they can give you in the course   I wish you luck on your future mate Wait  What's wrong  Your brother gotta cater to his gf and his gf want to go to the party   Seems like you just not over the break up Tomorrow or today Every time I have been out in public I have felt less than welcome  I will try to get out more though  Thank you for the kind words Hit up  r dogs and  r dogtraining   Pick a breed or mix with an energy level you are enthusiastic about dealing with  A border collie needs hours to run daily  for example  Which is why so many become destructive  their families are not able or willing to exercise them enough    Lots of "older puppies"   dogs 6 months to 2 years old end up in shelters  They get big and their people haven't put the training in  So then you have a problem with barking  or jumping  up or chewing   These can be great dogs  But the training takes time  And you may need to untrain bad habits from former owners   Don't rush  Get a sense what you like  And what you can handle  Go look at lots of dogs  Talk to people  You never know who is fostering a nice dog in need of a home Someone texted you instead of sending a wedding invitation  Was it an incredibly low key event  Because that just seems odd  Ooooh don't worry  girls are not stupid  if you don't deserve her  she knows it already  Looks like someone is trolling the meme  The bird is smiling in the first photo  Take a keeperLonely guy here who has nothing to live for  not even friends and I can say is that the loneliness eventually catches you  I wish I had an IRL friend     We know because we do not lack self awareness   A lot of normies do lack self awareness and they assume if you're FA you must be worse than them You're right  talking in and of itself will not fix the issue  You can't change the situation so you need to change your perspective and your behavior in order to have less maladaptive feelings toward it  That's where the talking with someone with whom you have good therapeutic rapport comes in  I'm very glad you are getting help  it sounds like you have made the right choice for yourself and often that is half the battle  Maybe more    I wanted you to know that it's perfectly normal to be overwhelmed to the point of breaking by children  When my twins were born my father looked me in the eye and said "Remember  No one ever fell off the floor  No one ever died from crying  At some point  probably at 2am  you are going to be so angry with your child  Put them on the floor  go into another room and watch a tv show "  A dirty secret of parenting an infant is how close we all come to losing it  Every parent I know will admit to this    The good news is it's going to be better very soon  Difficult babies almost always become much more comfortable between 12   18 months as their digestive systems finally mature and they suffer from far less bloating and GI pain    Anyway  enough rambling  You sound like a great mom  not a bad one  Please know that  And hang in there    it gets better  So much better and easier so fast  This  it's never so much wanting to kill oneself as much as it is just hoping for death You basically hit the lottery  cash out and disappear I am most definitely over the break up actually  I even have a new woman I just wanted to hang out with my brother for New Years my reddit friends  My ex is just kind of spiteful and sneaky and very manipulative  Who Was told in 8th grade "you're not the kind of guy girls want to date "  I've heard this before It's a complicated number of things but basically anxiety impairs cognition which itself creates more anxiety  It's the reason your mind seems to go blank during those situations  I had the same thing happen to me  Found my boyfriend dead one morning on my bathroom floor  heroin OD  I didn't even know he used   It's a shock  You'll be in a state of shock for a while  there's no way avoiding it  Please take care of yourself  and allow others to take care of you  during this difficult time  You have my deepest sympathy  Feel free to message me anytime if you'd like to talk There's an extra problem to the "great personality" thing I didn't think of last night   For a lot of women  when they meet a guy  put him in the category of "date" or "not date"   If you're in that second category they'll still think of you that way even when they see your "great personality"   Getting out of that second one is difficult at best   Wat Hey man if you're socially active then it'll probably happen LIVE Yup That is the best way  Meeting someone through a mutual friend has always been the way I've done things  Although I met a girl at a bar and ended up becoming friends and then sleeping with her lmao  We have always been open with each other about how my illness affects us in our marriage  he has been extremely understanding  relaxing and calm about it  He knows that him reacting strongly to me when I come to him only exasperates my erratic emotions and that I need him to be the level headed one when I cannot be  even when I try  I would much rather him to be relaxed than panicked and upset  I told him years ago that if I ever come to him saying I can't do it anymore that I just want him to hear me  support me and let me know what to expect  To be cool  calm and collected because I may not be able to do so myself  I guess I'm just not so great at letting that be known Everything you've build together  everything you've both worked to become  all of the dreams you've had together  all of the desires you pursued  all that you are  and all the good you've become  everything you like about yourself because of him  and any dreams he may have given you  hold on to it all twice as hard now   I cannot relate to the intensity of your pain  but I can try to ease it by making you remember the good in your life    Remember him and all the good things you've both had together  Remember the type of persons you each became in each others company  Now  know that it's still possible to have those good times  Life isn't fair  and your going to be angry  distraught  and you may feel you'd want to collapse  But he wouldn't want that for you  You may not be able to bring him back  but know that he would want you to use your two hands and build yourself a harness to pull yourself back up  He would want you to use your two hands and build a new pillar to support you  Those five fingered grips can raise you back up slowly but surely  Use them to build a memorial to bring you solace    One tiny thing you could do would be to grab a piece of paper and something to write with  Jot down all of your feelings  emotions  and thoughts  Do this at least once a day  Find comfort in remembering those words he said to you  And heed that advice  Do it for him  and do it for yourself  like he would want you to   The pain won't go away for a long while  So right now  cry out all the tears you need to  Eat all the food you can  drink water  and take care of yourself  Eventually that pain will lessen  And you can find happiness again   If you need someone to talk to  or to hang out with online  I give you the option to pm me    Otherwise  find strength in his memory  and use it to make things better Yes  we really are that sad  We probably do need help  but there is a limit to how helpful that help can actually be Bro this is unnecessary  Don't be that dude because you'll end up being that dude for the rest of your life   Maturity will always clear your name She just said she doesn't want to go ice skating anymore and said that maybe we should go to a movie  theatre or somehwere else  What are some otehr good options   D Good oneLucky you  Both my parents passed away The problem could be your brain is thinking beyond its ability  This can cause a mild headache but not super severe  Your brain might need a break  But not to long  Your meditation could have become a "drug"  This is completely normal like those who have to exercise to clear there head  This could be the same way for you but meditation Who is this person and why are you telling them that you have no friends    After being the awkward eager kid for much of high school  I learned a valuable lesson  people want to be around winners  Or at least  those they perceive to be winners  They want to be around people who are fun  happy  entertaining    talking about how lonely you are sends the opposite message    Even if you  are  going to sit alone in a room crying on NYE  that should never be the message you're sending out to other people  because it will literally have them running in the opposite direction from you  Just my two cents as a someone who is fairly social So what do you suggest  Should I not reply her   I was just offering playshare we just have to be in a party chat for that  P   I'll probably get it now  too many people keep saying to get it There is no reason to feel awkward  It's good that you realize that you fucked up  Also remember that they were young once too  and they fucked up just like you did  That's why your dad is making jokes  He gets it  Kids screw up  As for the boredom  why not take up a musical instrument or some kind of art  Think of this as a period to work on your discipline and passion  It might be the best thing that ever happened to you  For right now  get some Gatorade Wat Did she express interest in it when you asked  I never went ice skating  I didn't want to go ice skating  I was invited and felt pressure to go ice skating  I ended up in a full leg cast for a year   Ask her if it would be something she would be interested in  and I'd say have a backup suggestion  It sounds fun and romantic  but some people will say "Sounds like I'm going to make a fool out of myself and or injure myself and that's no fun on a date "If she suggested a movie  what's wrong with that I will say what I always have said  He is a twatwaffle  Oh gosh  Well maybe we should just go somewhere closer lol   I'm trying to make it under  1000 for each of us   Why isn't the drive from SF to SEA that's great  I would think it would be pretty along the coastCash out  This is a job that runs down 50 year old  experienced business men to the point where they give up a lot  You're young  you don't need that stress  Sell the company and work as a consultant for awhile  maybe even for that business  You should aim for freedom at 20  Hell  you could probably even continue to work for that company and help grow it  but don't take on that much responsibility  I get what you're saying  I try to maintain a perspective that fits my situation and I am able to build things in my life  but that always leads me to feeling like I have built a glass house  Eventually that perspective slips  I get angry  and bad things happen    Thank you for your responses I just reply with  "My face"Jim beam and NetflixAgreeing with  u HonestlyKidding  The movie is best  Ask to take her to dinner beforehand  Nothing fancy  but definitely not fast food  Texas Roadhouse  or Logan's Roadhouse  would be perfect  I feel the same damn way  I always make the wrong choice   That's cool   How'd you meet people   I haven't been out by myself in a while  but at times when I had  I never met anyone   i made an experiment  i sent a text message to those people on Christmas   I sent nothing on nye  This way I clearly signaled that I cared about them on Christmas  so they would be able to know I care about them so they would be able to send me a text message on nye without thinking "i'll let him send me a text message so that I know if he cares about me"   I got nothing on nye    I don't matter to them  end of story   It's really hard to consciously let go of those "friends"  I can put the " now  with whom I shared most of my  social  life with    I'm scared Yep  That's true    The friendzone  One never escape it Now let's say you and I go toe to toe in bird law and see who comes out the victor I'm european  I've no idea what those things are   D Thank you  it's nice to know it's normal to get angry with a baby  Not that I like it  or want it to happen but that when it does happen I'm not alone in it  I'm trying my hardest to be a good mom and often it feels like an uphill climb during an avalanche  I don't know if anything I do is going to actually benefit him but I'd like him to know that I'm trying  In plenty of ways  I can relate to you as well  There are moments where I try to rationalize my loneliness  but in reality   I know I need to do more with my life  I hate it when girls have huge metal penises and don't use lube You was stoopids got drunk more importantly you're alive I assume thats all your parents give a  fuck about really   Have you ever walked over an unconscious homeless person and not phoned the EMT's  there are people who will do that 'not my problem' I've phoned the ambulance for a homeless person lying outside the shops and not one fucker thought to put thier coat on him   You could have passed out smacked your head of the pavement pissed yourself and not one fucker would have stopped to make sure you were okay  thats how you make things good by being a decent human   I don't have any advice for you  because you already know what to do  I just want to offer you a big virtual hug and let you know you are a good mother  Hopefully you told them to fuck off moose blood  They have pretty good service for half the priceNever had friends to exclude me  Win win  Nobody excludes me and I annoy no one that's not an sjw  that's a numbnuts Just stopped replying  Not worth letting them play the victim card with my name on the screenshots   Edit  I've had a couple girls do this before in HS  Don't give them what they want and they start rumors  Don't feed their flames  Thanks for the support  I'll let you know if I do Well if you are capable of being social and are confident in general but spend most time alone then you are just an introvert  Some of us  can't  get any friends gf and have never had them  Also personally I'm pretty shit at other aspects of life too You're a good man   If his wings are strong and he can fly  he will likely be okay   Google bird and wildlife rehabilitators and find one who will chat with you on what your best next step will be   Thank you so much for the virtual hug and encouragement  Sometimes it is better than advice to just to know someone cares  Thank you  Why don't you want to get better  In high school I mightve been dumb enough  Since then  no  nopeThis right here  Driving with overbearing parents just adds to the anxiety

destruction  and when it does I'm going to love all these god damn worthless optimists eating their words  Unfortunately  it will be the poor nations that suffer first  as always  You can actually already see it happening  in Syria  the war was exacerbated by a poor crop yield  and there is a famine warning in West Africa  But eventually it'll trickle down to the US and I'll delight in the destruction of a society which was never worth a god damned dog shit to me Robbin D  Hood  If you can stand suspicious looks from your neighboursYou are incredibly brave  and a loving wife and mother  If that were not so  you wouldn't be willing to get help  I admire you more than you can ever know  and I'll keep you in my prayers  xoxoMy main problem with getting off social media atm is that my phone is notorious for "losing" text messages  as well as calls  Facebook is the only way for people to be SURE they get a message to me  On top of that  family members are always posting newly scanned photos of family from LONG ago that no one else has  A cousin posted an album of 154 pictures  and only 5 of them were in our collection  When i finally get the money saved up i'll replace the phone  and likely get off it though  But right now im paying off a car  so the money to buy a phone isn't there No don't do that  All you gotta say is something along the lines of  "sorry but no thank you  I am happy where I am right now"  The less you say the better   The sooner you get in the habit of being really mature about things  the sooner people will respect you  But gf's will AKWAYS tell their gfs if a dude is being immature  Likewise for men  You never want to give women an opportunity to throw the word "immature" in with your name  I'm so sorry for your loss and the trauma you've just endured  I hope you have someone to keep you company  and that you're not alone  Sending you a big hug   Your advice helped a lot  The initial panic and sadness as worn off  I've been covering it and only looking at it to wash or lotion it  I've been imagining that it's on someone else's body whenever I see it  and it's really not an awful tattoo  But I still hate it  I've decided laser treatment would make me the happiest  so I'm gonna let this bad boy heal up and then get it zapped as soon as I can  Hopefully it'll be gone by next year  No sweat  just a mistake that can be fixed Maybe I'll get lucky this year      who am I kiddingThere's no easy way to tell him you just have to be upfront and quick about it  If you just tell him you see him as a friend he'll most likely be fine with it and if he isn't then you weren't meant to be friends with each other    The longer you wait to tell him that you only want to hangout as friends the more he'll resent you for leading him on regardless of if you actually are  Thank you so much for your support and encouragement  I wish you all the best for this year and every one after  Live a decade without ever hearing "I love you" or any other act of affection and see how you fucking feel  No  that isn't hyperbole  Of course it's not a fucking joke  Jesus fucking Christ  use your god damn head   I saw your pic in  r veganfitness  and I think you look great  Hopefully things will work out for you in 2017 Yeah I thought the same about 2016  But then it turned out to be pretty meh Thanks  man  It's nice to know that y'all are so supportive Got it totally    Many Thanks   Gonna do it that way  Oh boy  what a way to start off 2017 I agree  sell and become a weed farmer or something Tried "help"  It didn't help Birds often steal and eat the eggs of other birds  so it's not unheard of    If Im correct  1  100 words is around 2 3 pages   Yeah so this was something I submitted to a magazine that specializes in "flash fiction"  sub 2k words       Maybe you can just write as a hobby   For sure  I will continue to write no matter what kinds of reviews I get  It's just   since I have so little real communication in my life  I look at writing as a way to make other people think and feel things  That's all I really want to do  To reach the heart of a reader   Hey  thanks for reading and have a great new year Good on your dad  That's awful of your mum to say  honestly  You should maybe be like "so do you want me to hide the rest of myself from you too  You signed up to have a kid  you signed up for whatever it was gonna turn out to be  Either you have all of me  or you don't have me " Or something  I know that won't fix it  but from experience I can say sometimes it feels worse not to say anything even if saying something won't fix it The worst part of a hangover for me is the anxiety and guilt I feel the next day   r rationalAs hard as it is to believe  five years from now you'll look back on these dark days and you'll probably feel two emotions  the first is you'll be happy to be alive  and  the second is you'll realize how screwed up your family was  and will probably still be  You aren't like them  Amy took advantage of you  Who knows if she was trying to punish her husband for something they disagreed about  or if she just wanted to see how far she could exert her influence   You did the absolutely right and heroic thing in turning your father in to protect your niece  That your mother is blaming you for the situation is further proof of how messed up they are    You need some counseling  and fast  Call your local suicide prevention hotline and ask how you can find a counselor  Trust me  OP  suicide is not the answer  no matter how awful you feel right now  The world needs more good people like you  not one less   Cheers  I'd hang out with you too a lot of these points i can relate to  sorry man i hope 2017 things start getting better  And honestly i'd like to read what you got   Makes sense  My point being she'd probably still enjoy you taking her out to dinner as well  Dinner and a movie always go hand in hand  Let's get real here  none of us will ever even get close to getting any and should just stop trying  But because we are a determined bunch of fuqers we will keep on trying I think what you're experiencing is anxiety  I was utterly convinced I would not live to see my 30th birthday  The feeling was pervasive throughout my 20s  Guess what  I'm bearing down on 60 now  and I'm pretty sure I still have a few good years left     Sounds like masochism   How can you demonstrate "tough love" unless you've first demonstrated "love"  That's just being a dick What is it and why do your parents think it's a scam  Also never trust any "girl" who comes here and says she just wants to talk or offer advice  We are easy meat for catfishers Yeah  that was definitely my most "Peep Show" moment in real life       So could your problem be just looks   Looks are definitely a problem but they are far from my only problem  I have crippling social anxiety and it's very hard for me to interact with people "well " I spend so much time overanalyzing everything I do and say that talking to people just makes me depressed  What you're describing seems like textbook  disassociation  http   www ptsd va gov professional PTSD overview

You're welcome   I have social anxiety so I kind of know what you mean   Why do you feel that you aren't welcome  were people mean to you or something I'm really serious about keeping you in my prayers  Life will get better  I promise  xoxoxoRefuse to jerk off in front of her anymore  Insist that you get into couples therapy Thank you  that means a lot Thats a very good point   better to have one good friend than a bunch of fake friends Didn't see it on mobile I misread it and thought you meant she wanted to get back with you  Sorry  But it still holds  Just tell her in order for you to formally move on  you think it would be best to keep our distance  Or something like that  I don't have the energy to do most things lately  I've been drained of all my energy and I don't really know why oh my god  that was a type for "wanted"  LolCall your credit card company  Ask them to immediately stop payments to the service  What you have already lost you could hopefully get back from them but I'm sure it says somewhere that you will be charged a cancellation fee  It only took me 5 min to read on how it's a scam  Make sure to research as much as you can when putting your credit card down  If it sounds to good to be true then it usually is   Goodluck Thank you dude  and I'm 16  Not the first time I've been drunk but definitely the last It's like a program to teach you how to do social marketing  My parents looked at it too when I showed them and they're telling me it's a scam  I could lose a bunch of money if I don't get it back so kind of stressed out Thanks  also an instrument sounds like a good idea I'll look into it Pomeranian  I have a small apartment too and absolutely love sharing it with my tiny couch muffin  Nooo   this is strange Thank you  right now it's pretty easy for me to get distracted and realise how lucky I am to have come out of this completely fine  Cheers dude Thanks for the help I will try and contact them and get it back If I was you I'd keep her away from my sister  She's only going to bring her down  And your parents have the right idea giving her a curfew  It might be hard now but she will be so thankful to her parents when she is older and has a good job  That privelaged white girl won't stick around to see her succeed because if she ever does she'll split  She sounds like a typical parasite Fall in love with the pigeon and invent wireless electricity And that changes what  exactly    You're using a vulnerable person's insecurities and flaws for your personal convenience  You're rationalizing your actions by using his unhealthy attachment to you to justify using his income to keep your life comfortable    You get to fuck other men while maintaining the benefits you get from him   You don't get to have your cake and eat it too    Do you guys think it works  I definitely had some crazy experience by not being too available  not even on purpose I've come to the same conclusion about myself  Had a total breakdown today when packing things for a move  Too much unresolved emotional bullshit since I was a child teenager and too much going on in my life right now  just can't take it anymore  Can't do life   Hope you feel better soon  you're not alone   I understand it sucks   Do you I too suffered from depression after my children   Do not be afraid to ask for help  or walk away when you need to  Therapy and meds did wonders for me  as did taking some alone time  quiet me time  It's not selfish   You are not a bad mother   Your hormones and brain chemistry work differently   so finding ways to cope and function are going to be different for you   Mothering is a hard job  Really hard  Doing it while having mental illness issues is difficult   Get as much help as you can  and try not to let yourself feel like you are a failure   You admitted you need help  That's a hard step  You can take other hard steps too   You can do this  If I can do it  you can too  Cause I was a huge fucking mess  Best wishes  and keep us informed of your progress   cause you will progress  I'll be thinking of you  Thank you a lot for your reply  Good to hear it might be worth a shot  It sucks to hear about the side effects it gave you though  wish it worked out differently for you  Side effects suck  some more than others  but I have tried over 20 meds in the past in an attempt to regulate my mood  with no luck so far  So there is little choice left for me  Do you remember how often you needed your blood levels checked  About a month ago I was put on Depakote which also requires regular check ups but I can see no improvement yet whatsoever  If dosage increasements turn out to be useless there is only Lithium left to try  Nice to know you felt like a human being again  I am always scared meds will turn me into a zombie  When I was on Aripiprazole or Paliperidone  my emotions just faded away and it was even more horrible than being severely depressed and suicidal  Do you remember which dosage of Lithium you were on when you started noticing any differences  why can't I post an image here when I upload it directly to reddit  Having to go through imgur is an extra step Try using WhatsApp or Hangouts or any other messaging system that doesn't rely on cellular back channels Yeah  I have common sense  Being alone is not something anyone should experience Yeah  anyway the statement holds true    Again ThanksWow what a way to tell you  But the way it sounds you deserve better  Hope your year turns out to be the best one yet We can do this  If we can admit we need help we can get better  If you want to talk I am here for you   hugs  That's not what I meant   Being alone  really  gets to you   Common sense may tell you this  but until you've experienced it firsthand  you don't really "understand" So that's a real thing   This blows my mind     Name it "The house formerly numbered "You are making the best decision to seek out help and support  I hope you continue to have the support of your husband  How do you still even have motivation to do anything  I havent experinced the majority of the stuff you have and can't even bother to get out of bed most days Does reading reddit count  Thank you for your support and encouragement  It's so nice to hear that others experience the same things as me  I will be sure to update when I can and I hope to be able to see my progress and growth too  If it makes you feel any less alone back in 2013 I lost my mother to cancer  I was 18 almost 19  at the time    It's a complete shit feeling to lose someone you're so close to  The most important thing you can do even though it's good to be there for your younger siblings  is you really need to pay attention to your own mental health and well being    It will get better  Soon you'll stop being sad  as often  and begin reminiscing on all the memories you have with him     Don't be afraid to cry right now but also don't be afraid about not being as sad about it all in the future     The thought of not continuously being sad over losing your father might make you feel guilty later on but remembering happy times and his memory bringing smiles instead of tears is what he would want    I'm incredibly sorry for your loss  My thoughts are with you and your family    Stay safe  cry whenever you need to and remember your dad the way he would want you to remember him  the mind is a muscle  you need to challenge it  relentlessly and not a little bit at a time  in order to grow see progress    I'm studying music at uni college   an area that requires little no knowledge of the subjects and skills one learns during IB   i was in your position once too  all into that self learning thing  but i didn't see progress in my verbal and argumentative skills until after i was challenged by forced to participate in immersed in the difficult group discussions during my classes  and after i wrote  did poorly on  then learned from a couple of dozen research papers  etc  you have to be challenged    to be given tasks that you don't think you'll be able to do    and then you have to do poorly on those tasks  and then improve from there   it sounds like what you're studying in college isn't challenging you enough in a way that satisfies you  otherwise you wouldn't be making this thread  maybe take on a double major Thank you so much  I wouldn't have been able to make it this far without him and I couldn't imagine my life without him there for me  Yes  My cousin has a greyhound and he pretty much just lounges around waiting for someone to pet him  Super chill dude  I'm against this  Learning is good but also better be able to get along with everyone on their level  That requires also knowing whatever Norm MacDonald likes  Same   Been "getting help" for 10 years and I'm worse off than ever Maybe I'm lucky to have had a few friends in my life and a mom that cares about my future  But that doesn't mean I haven't felt like I'm alone in some sort of aspect    My original post was just to clarify if this sub is just filled with pure depression or people joking about it or a mix of both with subscribers not realizing it could be both   I'm sorry that you're in this state  and I can only hope you do get joy because you and everyone here deserves it what server are you on  I am on diabolos guys No  You're young enough to turn it around  You can lose the weight  probably with minimal telltale signs  If you aren't ready for college  take a year out to sort your shit out  Ah well shit  if you don't mind adding fat you can just eat like crazy and skip gym I guess  D  My problem with being skinny was just the lack of muscles  if you just wanna be not skinny  muscular or not  Then just eat It's easier to get rejected in your own home than it is to spend time and money outside  Just spitballin here  still don't know why I use it lol Hahaha I laugh at some also  but I haven't seen them  I would be rolling with laughter  Omword   Now I'm on a hunting spree   Sounds like she's moving on  Very sorry A lot of the suggestions I received said to do thought replacement  Think of something positive if the images come into my head  This felt unproductive since I have to constantly remind myself to do this  which in turn  reminds me of the images  Also the standard breathing and meditation exercises  Let it be known I didn't give up on these after 1 day   I tried this over multiple months with no change in the way I feel  I'm sorry to hear  I really am  Just please don't assume that your sorrow will last Especially unplanned AIDS   1  You can change your GP t any time  You don't need to give a reason   2  In England you can self refer to IAPT  There should be a less than 26 week wait from first contact to start of treatment   3  Your doctor can explore "social prescribing"   this is a holistic approach that looks at education  employment  relationships  social life  family life  etc  They can refer you to some providers   I know a bit about MH treatment in England  and I'd be happy to try to help you get the treatment you deserve  Please feel free to PM me Serenity now  insanity later  edit  a wordI have this weird way of thinking that karma's gonna kick in and reward me greatly for all these years of pure garbage  The tv one was late September October  and the spanking one was in the summer  but there have been a few funny ones  Look for one in last 7 10 days titled '"my cat ruined my life"The despair feels palpable today  This is the year when it all starts  We're fucked  We're so fucked Is there a name for this meme  I like it and I've seen it around RedditI've just deleted my Facebook and twitter account as they seem so pointless I'm so sorry for your loss  Believe it or not  Great Danes make great apartment dogs  You do need to get them out and give them exercise  but they sleep a lot and lie around as well  Well it seems to me that's she's giving you a lot of hints that she does  If you don't want to straight up talk to her about loving her and wanting to date her  hey it can be scary to admit that don't judge me  why not start giving hints yourself  Like showing how much you appreciate her and telling her that she made your life for the best   She seems really into you op so don't worry  I wish you the best of luck    Well let me start off by saying that I'm not an electrical engineer and have no aspirations to be one  However  many people in my career field use what we do as a stepping stone towards becoming an electrical engineer  I serve in the United States Air Force as a Civil Engineer and my speciality is electrical systems  If the military is something you have considered I can tell you that it's one of the best ways to get massive experience in the field as well as free schooling once you are out which if you go straight after high school would be as early as age 22 if you wanted  I'm not saying the military is right for everyone but if you live in the United States it's a very viable path that provides you free schooling  tons of on the job experience  and employers on the outside love to hire prior military  She texted me this morning saying she doesn't remember much from last night and that she's sorry about how drunk she got last night and for anything she might have said done   What's the best way to bring up the topic of money  I've always felt awkward asking people for money  even when it's justified You will face pressure and stress no matter where you are in life  Owning running a business is very challenging  mentally  emotionally  etc   regardless of the size of the business  Unlike others in this thread  I'm not going to tell you to sell and pursue other options  You should work at getting your business to be more enjoyable for you  You being the CEO have that power  You could hire people to take some of the pressure off  make those tough business decisions for you  At 20 years old  you are in a very impressive place in life  but you are also only 20 and do not have the experience on the emotional end to detach yourself from the tough choices you will need to face  Hire a human resources department to handle the hiring and firing  since that seems to be taking its toll on you  Hire some trustworthy managers to handle the day to day details that will wear on you over time  And remember  you are 20  You should be out having fun and hanging with friends and falling in love  People work to live  they don't live to work  Find a way to balance both  I'm very sorry for your loss    Honestly  I think the best thing you can do for your younger siblings is let them see that you're hurting  so they know it's OK that they're hurting too  But everybody needs to find their own way through grief Exactly   There's a reason why we're all FA  there's no hope for us  This was after we started talking to each other  after we shared our interests and found that a lot of them were common  The hell if I know I think I love your dad  He hit exactly the right note   And maybe your mom will come around in time   Anyway  congrats Yep   Need to stop ignoring red flags Thanks for the reply GraniteMarker  I wasn't sure if anyone would want to talk to a person like me  Apart from criminals like my father there aren't many people as low and sickening as myself    I know my family is broken  it's been shattered but not apart for years now  My brother's and I have always been on the same team though  we were supposed to grow old and help each other navigate through life    That won't happen now  and while Amy may have started the ball rolling I only nudged it along farther  Whether or not they had marital discourse means nothing  I was a brother  holding the ultimate trust of Andrew  Everyone saw me and Amy growing closer but he trusted me enough to not believe I would ever let this happen    It's nice to hear or see the words good people  however I don't know how you could possibly say that about a person who's just told you he abused the trust vested in him by family members  I could see it if I had offered more than heartbreak and pain  but that's what they've all gotten from me    I have been considering talking to a professional  mainly because I'm terrified to do the deed  What's stopping me is the knowledge that whatever a counsellor might say to me makes no difference to my family  After all  this isn't about me anymore  I've learned a real hard lesson about selflessness  While we might be a broken family  it's still my family and I want nothing else than to be with them    I don't think I want to go on without them  I know I could  i just won't  I was suicidal even before knowing what my Dad did  I don't want to imagine what I'll feel like after I've digested this last month    Thanks again Granite   50 in 07ALL HAIL THE NEW PIGEON LORDI have been on lithium for about 2 years now  Overall  it's been a good experience  I am generally emotionally stable  In the beginning  there was severe numbness for me  I wasn't really suicidal anymore  but I was extremely lethargic and nihilistic  Over time that has worn off  but be prepared to feel like a zombie at first  There are a couple physical side effects as well  First  the shaking  It's gone down a lot now  but when I started taking it my hand tremors were very noticeable  I couldn't even hold a pencil  Those died down though  Another thing is weight gain  Other then that there weren't really any other significant side effects  For me  lithium has been great  but I take it for bipolar disorder  Hope this helps  Real world works if you're attractive  believe me I've tried  I've done cold approaches  even spoke with girls randomly in my classes  Unless you're good looking that doesn't work  That and almost every girl I talk to doesn't share similar interests  Add to the fact that I'm fat on top of that  and nobody wins  I am trying to lose weight though I'm on Gilgamesh but I don't mind starting overI just hate people  not  depressed like some people on hereI don't think I can afford couples therapy but I will start looking into it  I don't want to lose my wife and this isn't healthy behavior   I'm not sure what I've done wrong to end up in this predicament  Maybe I should have never agreed to masturbate Infront of her in the first place Hugs  I'm sorry  He play such a warm caring person   Apparently he was like that in like     Such people make the world a better  and their leaving leaves a shadow     However the brightness of the light of their life makes the shadow only a small gray thing of loss I am from Switzerland and don't know much about your schooling system but are there extra classes to take to keep you busy  Maybe there you also find some cool people which can influence you in a positive way  There are also some awesome youtube videos where you can learn additional things about programming  But please do me a favour    find yourself also a hobby off the computer  It is really important that you also get out of the house  sport  photography  cook etc    As for your parents  Parents shouldn't say stuff like that but ignoring them trying to be nice to you until you move out  do you really think that is the solution  Does it hurt trying to make this work  If it doesn't at least you can say you tried your best from your side  Good luck for your 2017 Hey  I wish I knew what to say    I'm sorry  But I'm glad she has you and the others Sorry to hear we're in the same boat  I've sort of only recently realised that I have the right for boundaries  too  Sounds like you have established healthy ones  and are going about it very maturely  Do you get back lash from your mother for this  How do you handle the emotional hurt and not taking her words to heart   Thank you  hugs Just by admitting you need help is huge progress   Not only is it hard to admit to ourselves   but to others as well  And you did so publicly  That's pretty impressive in my book  I know you will thrive  I hope you know that as well  Well u just took the first step  U admitted u need help  I wish u nothing but the best  I hope u keep your appt and get the help u need  Its not failure  Ur a strong person and u got this     only in LA  This city and its people get more absurd everyday  Lolsad how the poor countries that did nothing to contribute to global warming will be the first to perish  I wonder how long before life in developed countries will be massively impacted by global warming thoughWell that should definitely be a big red flag and hope you move on and find a better person  Honestly I think the description of the no interest girl was right up my alley  Kinda messed up but I think my idea of the perfect relationship is just someone that's there physically  but not necessarily that you're always talking and doing things with  Sai is not compatible with Mac It's more common than you think  It takes a lot of strength to realise you can't do something  I hope you get the help you need  Oh I did read my cat ruined my life one   SmhShes obviously going through something that shes not ready to tell you about yet  6 months may seem like a long time but in my experience some people take longer to fully open up to a partner than the others   The way i see it you have two options  1  End it 2  Wait it out for awhile longer and be there for her  She obviously cares about you and if you stick through it with her  she will care for you even more in the end once her problems have passed  As the other commenter stated  there really is no one like that  I think people greatly underestimate the amount of work people put to have successful lives and relationships   I have several friends in their early 20s who keep jumping from a failed relationship to a failed relationship because they aren't wiling to change an iota of themselves  Too weak to give up sex and intimacy until they actually find someone worthwhile  completely refuse following a healthy diet and an exercise routine  and complete lack of hobbies and interests   Every action they take in all aspects of life is an indicator that they're not willing to do anything to better their prospects in both life and relationships  They just keep adding to their baggage   I love them and I wish they could change Well  you could work on developing a rewarding career so that you have something positive going on in your life   It seems like the happier people here are the ones who have jobs that they like   Most people spend a lot more time at work than they do with loved ones  after all   Fair enough  If you're happy with yourself and not just a self loathing pity partier like many people here then good on ya  Hey  is there anyone in your life that could come over for a couple of hours and just help you clean up a bit  I know the last time I had a full blown meltdown  hasn't showered in days  disgusting room no clean underwear etc  I very honestly told my father that I was struggling and couldn't do it  I took a shower and washed my hair while he did some of my laundry  Seriously  immediately things felt a little less hopeless  because something managed to get done  If there's no one who can help you even just go wash your face take a shower when you read this  I know it feels pointless or impossible but if you can manage to finish one very small task you might just feel a little better  or at least cleaner  Maybe  this  http   www npr org sections money 2014 10 16 356176018 the most popular jobs for the rich middle class and poor  can help you out  There are just some examples and pretty common one so i don't know how they can be that useful    I just wanted to say that sometimes it's easier to go by what you don't want to do  For example write down some subjects like Art  Engineering  Medicine Health care     and then cross whatever you're sure you don't want to follow  Then go over each area and think of jobs for each one and research them   Sry I can't be of much help   take careSometimes   dead is bettaNo  don't do this   I'm an FA woman over 40  but there's nothing that you've described about yourself that would have been a dealbreaker for fat  unattractive  socially isolated  17 year old me all those years ago  There are other young women out there today in exactly my predicament    they are shunned socially for their weight  their features  their disabilities  their chronic illnesses  or other things outside of their control  in spite of being kind  generous  smart people  When you start college  look for them Tell me something good about your friend  Thanks  Same to you and yours  circumstances notwithstanding I get that you don't want to lose her  however you can't just give in to anyone like that man  If you absolutely can't afford therapy then all you need to do is stop giving in  You don't want to have most of your life ahead of you full of just coming home and jerking off to were your penis is in so much pain  That's not healthy  for you physically and your relationship  Sounds like your mom associates shame with gayness or bisexuality  Talk to her about it  explain it in your own terms  You're the exact same child as you have been I guess you already evaluated this possibility but why don't you message the girl the one you said that saw you  and ask her what you did  Be honest  tell her you don't remember a thing    If she never replies not even to tell you how bad it was what you did  do yourself a favor and forget about her  It takes months but it's the only way out "friends"I think loving someone is actually just liking someone for being alive  so long as you think the same way  And it's someone to grow with  For most of us you hit a certain age  there are only so many hours in the day  and apart from what you  do  together  even taking a nap together   life is mostly stagnant  Thanks  he's pretty great  I'm hoping she does too    Just because there's no correlation in this study doesn't mean it doesn't help a subset of people    Unless it makes some people's infections worse  that's exactly what it means  They say it eventually subsides in most people whether they get tonsilllectomy or not Thank you Yeah I did my best  I just said I just liked who I liked and I couldn't help it  I'm kind of done being ashamed of it  so I'm just like okay  that's done  I'm out of the closet to everyone immediately important  So she'll have to come around but I refuse to hate myself any more  Whilst I agree with your pissed off sentiment at the world  you can't tell people dating isn't better than being alone based purely off your own negative experience  I'm sure I speak for everyone else when I say we'd quite like to give that a go ourselves and see if it goes any better Thank you I should've say "Sometime"Thank you Sometimes people are conflicted about their feelings  liking some things in a SO but being repelled by others  If that's it  she has to sort this out for herself because you shouldn't change to please her  I agree with the other poster that giving it time and not too much deep thought will be a good course of action  Sometimes there is no "Why " to be determined because attraction is not a choice Or stress you out I don't believe that  She is here for a reason and I don't think it is much easier for girls than it is for guys here  Lets not undermine her "success story" on this subreddit because of her gender  This is great perspective on the issue of communication  If my wife was being this way and acknowledged something was wrong but would night talk  I would be very upset   But yes  6 months is still relatively new  and I think the best option would be to ask your girlfriend IF and WHEN she will ever share it with you  Tell her you care and need to know so you can deal with it together   All the best thats the first thing i sent her when i woke up    just a 'normal' message like wow we were fucked up last night i dont remember anything etc    i think i should get over her but i really dont want to  i like thinking about her  i love being with her  if i dont have her then honestly i dont see the point in going out or even studying anymore     I just told her it hurt too much to lie to everyone  What bothers me the most is that she managed to make it all about her  It was just like when I tried telling them i was depressed in high school  guess what  still am   She just said shit like well you think too much you've always been intense  I can't believe you took three years to say anything  blah blah   Like I get that I don't have kids and I don't know what this feels like  but it's like can't you at least give me the benefit of the doubt and try to understand where I'm coming from  Guess not  Math's the big one in high school  Take AP Calculus and AP Physics  Mechanics and E M   Make sure you really really understand all your math assignments  Obvious top picks for schools are MIT and Caltech  you can get whole lists of schools ranked by program quality  Google it  The school name is less important than what you do there  though  take relevant classes  get good grades  do a good capstone project   Plan to apply for internships every summer in college  STEM interns actually get paid and it looks really good on your resume to graduate with experience     Source  am electrical engineer No  because most people on Reddit aren't masters of linguistics and you won't get a lot of variety  Ah  Thanks for helping me  I will probably join gym someday when I am fatty   hahaYou've got a lot going on  No wonder you're having a rough time  That would throw anybody for a loop So look for someone else who is a non smoker if it's a deal breaker  To add a bit to what  u FMP11 has said  as it's good advice   I do have a small suggestion  but of course it will require a bit of boldness on your part  It seems cliché and even cheesy  but ask her to go see a movie with you  If she agrees  great  If she doesn't  don't be discouraged  because she may legitimately be busy or uncertain  It does not necessarily mean she isn't interested  If it does happen  give it some time and find another time with which to ask her out  but keep it simple  in this case  maybe a walk in the park  In the case of if she agrees to the movie though  after a bit of time  but still with plenty of time in advance  ask her if she would be up for going out to lunch beforehand  Depending on your budget  this could be different things  If you can afford it  take her out to a restaurant rather than a fast food joint  but nothing too fancy  First dates should be somewhat casual after all  Make sure she would be alright with the type of food served at the place  so have a couple places in mind before you ask if she would enjoy a specific one  If all goes well  you should have a lovely  comfortable first date for the both of you  Keep the conversation light  and don't get to deep into worrying about what to say  Sounds like you haven't had much trouble in your conversations  but I wouldn't want to steer you towards making her feel uncomfortable by asking her how she feels towards you while you're out and about  If all goes well and she's still smiling by the end of the night  I would say express your feelings when you take her home  Just my opinion on the matter  but I wish you luck  my friend I have considered that  Its the path that will most likely happen if i don't have the balls to do it  Thanks for not trolling I appreciate it as this sub is the only place I can really open up Thanks for your reply  Yeah I've been googling since I posted that and it seems lots of math  I'm not bad at math but I definitely need to devote myself to it more  Being a freshmen in high school I really have no idea what some good colleges for electrical engineering so that's something I'll probably get help with later   again thanks for the reply Thanks man  I am currently dieting and exercising more to try and lose the weight before im off at college  Thanks for the reply  Yeah I am aware that you can go through the military I just don't feel like that would be my thing  I'm just gonna slowly try to figure it out as I go through high school and hopefully it'll work out This is so true  I also agree we FA people ought to give other FA people a chance  just like we wish someone would take that chance on us I work for a multi billion dollar financial tech company with offices all over the world  We have a hierarchy in place where we eliminate the stress of position based responsibilities  Maybe it would be worthwhile for you to investigate a new structure for your company that you could implement easily since your company is small  in terms of people   If you ever want to chat about it  feel free to message me  I've also been in leadership positions before  Thank you very much  If I try to socialize at college I will take your suggestion into question  I appreciate the advice very much I'll try giving some hints  although I feel like I'll be a little obvious  Thanks Holy fucking shit all of these things happens to me CONSTANTLY Make sure to hit the "monetize" button  You can google where it is Cliché and cheesy things aren't all bad  besides she loves movies so that's a good idea  I suppose I could try it  I'm not very bold but I have a good feeling  Thanks Can you elaborate on why you see this as bad advice   Do you hold a position of anti intellectualism This is less rare than you might think  I'm not certain that what you're describing is exactly the same  but it's at least quite similar to a fetish typically called "vore"  for context as to why  think of words that typically use that term as a suffix  like carnivore omnivore  etc    Confronting it honestly and labeling it as a fetish or guilty pleasure  I'm pretty sure we can take you at your word  I can understand the self consciousness   everyone's got their tics  kinks  or otherwise offbeat fascinations that they probably would rather not make familial affairs of   but there are also communities out there that could relate to you  if you haven't already tried looking   If you haven't already seen it and you need something to satisfy the interest  let me suggest an anime  if you're into that at all  called Attack on Titan  Frankly  I eventually lost the stomach for it  awful pun not intended nor rescinded   but even from the point of view of someone who couldn't necessarily find much satisfaction from that angle  it also had an interesting and rather subversively political storyline   tldr  You do you  don't worry about this being too big a deal  There are others who can relate Congratulations    My epiphany was 3 years ago when I was like OH SHIT I LIKE CHICKS and then I was afraid I would be gay for a while but then a few months ago I was like nope I'm bi and lean to adds women  And if I am gay "in the end " whatever that means  whatever  It makes me happy  I like being happy   There's a big community waiting for you  I hope you're not going through a ton of self loathing like I did  cuz nothing feels better than being myself She sounds amazing and brave  I bet she had the most interesting stories to tell  You should write them down  Ask around all who knew her for them  They would make a great bookI know I'm not normal I'm weird and that'll keep me alone forever I've written songs for girls but that won't do me any good Title says itYou seem to already have a plan  so it's pretty good for a start   Also  for what this man that told you that a business degree is useless because you don't come from those "popular universities"  those people are juste some sheep following the popular opinion  If you've chosen to do this degree  I imagine that even if you don't know what you want to do  it's because it is what's please you the most  So I guess that if you're very interested and focused into it and have projects  all you have to do is find motivation and pass your degree and succeed to it  No matter where you come from  if you're good and full into what you do  you will do great things   What I said won't help you much  but after all this is your choice  and even if you're not sure now  it'll get better and you'll see from the experience if it suits you well  or not   Hope you're will be okay with it   I'm sure you will succeed easily   I appreciate your advice  I'll be honest I'm kind of the pussy in the relationship I should have stopped a long time ago when it was getting weird  My wife is very attractive  My friends always joke she's out of my league so I'm always worried she's gonna leave me   But she's the one with no job and cock obsession so I don't know why I feel like I'm the loser in the relationship It's funny how that theme seems to extrapolate to life in general  It's always the innocent that suffer the most from the deeds of the guilty  I never feel like going for a run until I am lying in bedI'll see her face to face in like 9 10 days unless i hear from her or try again  I'm nervous so i might just wait and feel it out when i see her on campus then Then deal with the smoking  Handy tip   if the smell bothers you take up smoking  You'll get used to it in no time  You don't look forever alone at all   You'll find someone  I only wish I could feel this I am religious  But I always say I believe the gospel not the church  The organised religion part is run by men women etc and therefore is always gonna be wrong coz even with the best will in the world  we're human and we get it wrong  I believe in the core values my religion has to offer but sometimes  more often than I'd like to think about  it gets corrupted by human beings  But a religion that is basically telling me to love God and love each other  I can get behind that  I deal with a lot of the same issues you mentioned OP  My mind gets stuck replaying insignificant interactions from the day  old situations  I worry way too much about what people think of me and it can be crippling   What's helps me is to recognize when I get stuck in that hamster wheel in my mind and remind myself  is what I'm worried about going to matter in a week  Month  Year  Five years   The answer is almost always no  And truth is  most people aren't as worried as you think they are about you  they are preoccupied with their own actions just as you are about yours now  It helps me to take a step back and realize that minor things like conversations and interactions are pretty unremarkable in our lives as a whole and when you look back on your life you probably won't remember most of the day to day stuff you worry about  this sub sucks  That old business man was an ass to everyone around him anyway  Honestly what you said helps me a lot  The reassurance makes me feel better  I'm just freaking out  Thank you and your comment is appreciated    You're by all means NOT a loser  I assume you love her and it sucks if you lose someone you love obviously  You don't have to lose her though  she just needs to get better  However it seems as though she's kind of controlling you in the relationship in a very unhealthy way  She will get better with time hopefully  By the way if you have any good friends or anyone you know that is good at resolving problems maybe they can counsel you since you can't afford a professional counselor  ANY counseling is better than none  Pleasing your significant other is an amazing thing but when it gets to be unhealthy is when you need to stop  You can't keep doing that to yourself OP  It'll only get worse for you and her from her on out if you continue to give in  I wish you and her the best of luck  and hopefully things can return as close to normal as possible  Happy New Years  I feel this way about a guy to a massive extent  And it's SO stupid  He has a girlfriend  And I just can't get the motherfucker out of my head Have you looked into the process for her to get a green card via marriage to you  I don't believe it is as simple as get married  get green card  live happily ever after Good job honey  I had ppd as well and new motherhood was a nightmare for me  I hope they get you on the right meds  and know that you aren't alone  We all feel like failures now and then  You are a good mother who is at her breaking point  You'll feel much better after you get the help you need It's honestly ridiculous how old fashioned those views are  It's not like you have a kid just to make it  you have a kid to raise it  guide it  see it through  and she's not acting like a good role model  I'm sorry you have to be the adult in this situation     there is  nothing  wrong with your preference  and there's  no  reason she should make you feel badly for this  She should treat it like the blessing that it is  She can only be attracted to one gender  but you have the opportunity to find a soulmate or whatever you want in any all genders  I know it hurts for her to be invalidating this  but just try to keep your eyes open to the positives of this  it's out there  and whether she likes it or not you can't and shouldn't put it away  It's easier said than done  but try not to let her get to you  The world is your multi gendered oyster  and you can pick whoever you want  you're not limited to one gender  you have the opportunity for different kinds of love  different kinds of sex  different relationship dynamics  and you have lots more places to look  I hope she comes round to this  and hopefully your dad's open mindedness rubs off on her  Best of luck and happy New Year   You sound strong to me  Admitting you need help is a huge step  One step I'm still too afraid to make  It's scary  You've told your husband and he's there to support you  I hope you follow through with the referral  Hugs  You did the right thing by breaking up with him  He shows signs of possesivness which is never good in a relationship    And a man in his 30s should be mature enough to handle an argument without it getying out of hand Always welcome      which is non professional prostitutes    women and girls 20 50 old   who get some extra money during the weekend  sometimes only when the husband is away    Didn't even know that kind of a thing existed You mean ordinary people willing to have sex with you just for extra money  I know  But it would seem like instead of trying to fix a forever alone  there is a different way to approach it  Sounds to me like you got yourself a pet pigeon now Yep  Funnily enough though  I actually found making friends more difficult when I was working full time because I'd have no goddamn energy  The wallet would be willing but the flesh was weak  Happy people don't act like this    And this is the issue right here    He refused to come down to Christmas dinner this year  I was really upset about this and I started crying  Why would you be upset and start crying   That was about him and not you   There is no reason for you to take that personally   He is miserable and what you told the relatives was not a lie  He is ill  but at this point  the illness is probably a more advanced form of depression   There is no reason to be upset if he refuses to meet with your guests  too   They are your guest  there is no reason for him to make them feel welcome   So you can understand  he feels miserable and wretched  and doesn't want others to see him  become fodder for their gossip  and judge him   There is nothing wrong with him choosing to remain confined while they are there   Counseling  would be very beneficial for him   But it would be beneficial for you as well   Just so you could maybe figure out why you take his mental issues to personally   As far as he goes  since he is still living in your parents' home  they can force him to go to counseling  or tell him that he can't remain in their home It does not  I've been this way since I was a kid and I love being alone  There is only a problem with being alone when you can't face who you really are and don't value yourself  No she's not I looked through your posts  6 months ago you posted about it   I hope he really does think about it and realizes what he means to you  I don't think he doesn't want to   he just finds it hard and hurtful to get very attached because of his depression as I see it    "I don't know how to ever find that again   " remember things will find its way to better situation even though emotionally you would think that life depends on that one person and life would be somehow tasteless without them and you may never find someone to replace them  think that every person we humans meet is special to us and stays within us specially the ones we love has the most impact  so that's normal  things will get better and you will feel better  give it sometime and hopefully things works out the best for both of youAh  I get it now  never tried out that feature  spectated my cousin once while playing Skyrim but he didn't let me control it because he was afraid that I'm going to quit to the menu and delete his character  His suspicions were right though  He should see a therapist imo  Sounds like depression   personality dissorder of some kind  Or just being a jerk  I'm not a "social" person though  In fact I push people away who want to be my friend    Can't is the problem  The problem is also you value relationships too much and place your self value on imaginary things that actually aren't what you think they are  Thank you  I'm not sure she will listen  It always goes back to all she's done for my children when they were 14 and 8  For a school year  Almost as if she sacrifices so much  I kissed my parents on the cheek in past years  and I was still quite lonely thank you for your replyAlone all my life too but my case I never received parental love so I am a little messed up  I guess this is how it is for you  which is a good thing   I sometimes feel this desesperation when I am alone and I've been in my computer for too long or I've reading about people who have SOs and such   I don't have anyone to miss but I still feel alone How is it easier for a girl to leave the house by herself than a guy to leave the house by himself  That makes no sense Look up the studies on heavy social media use and depression  I don't think that sort of thing can ever really alleviate loneliness in a lasting way Thank you I'm looking forward to getting helpA great idea would be to start going to a speaking club like toastmasters  They are cheap  available anywhere  and really low key  Sounding more intelligent really comes down to saying less and saying it with controlled timing Postpartum depression can rear its head whenever  If you've had these feelings in the past  then it's great you're wise enough to reach out  Keep up a positive attitude even when things are bleak  Keep going for your son     Thank you I hope you can find the strength and support you need and if you need someone to talk to I am here for you I'm in the same thing right now lmao  Hopefully someone would answer our prayersThank you for the encouraging words That you have schizo  From what I know  it can be overcome or at least you can try your best to overcome it and try to integrate into society and have a regular social life  I'm no psychologist but I just looked up schizo and this is the first thing that came up   "Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness  One of the biggest myths around the illness is that it isnt treatable  With the right supports  people can work or volunteer  be active in their own care  and contribute to their communities"  So I wouldn't give up  Yes you have various mental disorders and you're a lesbian that your family hates  So what  Those may make it difficult for you to have a normal life but it doesn't mean its impossible  If you are still having suicidal thoughts  I would just leave them as your thoughts  Just know that you're young and very attractive  at least you have that going for yourself  Just think positive and get help if you need so  That's all im saying  How can you look that  which has no life Okay  one comment of mine isnt going to get you out of this  so here are some things you can do   You can pm me and stay in touch if you want  I can talk to you while you remain faceless to me    rsuicidewatch might be able to help you with the thoughts you have  If you arent already  go see a psychiatrist that might have medical advice or a family doctor   Go to a therapist  psychologist to talk about what you are experiencing  Try it once it might help   Be open to your gf about what you are experiencing  She will probably support you through these situations  Also reach out to close friends  They can help you more then you might think   Yeah  Whenever I'm by myself I find myself talking out loud or humming  I don't know why I do it  but it seems to keep me energized  Haha Edited for some major typing errors  still typing on my phoneIf you don't get an answer here  you may want to try  r gaming Interesting you should mention that  One of the people in our group was this hot girl that kept snapping photos with her BF throughout the whole night  Once the drugs wore off  she became really depressed and started opening up about her anxiety and insecurities YOU ARE A FANTASTIC MUM    So many of us are the same struggling on and on not wanting to admit we are having a hard time with parenting and other problems    I went passed breaking point at easter I in a red mist of anger with my then not very supportive dh 4 yrs of broken sleep 2 sen children and 1normal one  during an arguemnent stabbed myself in the arm  Was nearly admitted to a mh unit social services got involved still are now  What really hurt was so so many people afterwards said we could see you going downhill but never said anything to me thing is if somebody said I can see your having problems I wouldn't of got into the state I got in   Again you are a fantastic mum your saying I need help  Fantastic mums know when they need help and they reach out and grab the help with both handsBe yourself  be honest to the people you trust and everything will be fine  You could talk to your friends aboit how you feel  They will probably understand  Open and honest most of the times is the way to goDefinitely make sure to name it after a meme so all of your neighbors don't understand and or dislike you before even meeting youDon't sweat it really  Their opinions don't matter anymore  They're gone and you're still you  One day  you'll find someone better  And she'll love you for you no matter how bad you think you're doing   First  stop and breathe   You did it   You made it   Now you get to decide what to do next   Second  decide   And remember that you have a LOT of choices  1  Stay CEO  2  Find a new CEO and downgrade yourself operationally  doesn't have to change the ownership of the company  though it usually will change it a bit   3  Find a new CEO and leave the company  again  may not change the ownership question   4  Exit completely  sell off the business    The up side is that you can essentially make this choice for yourself at this point   But if you wait too long  you mentioned a board   they can take control from you if things get out of hand   So your self realization that you're drowning is a GOOD thing   It's just now your number 1 priority to figure out how to handle it   Finding a new CEO could be the trick   This is essentially how Apple worked   Steve Jobs was the mouth  Woz was the brains   This isn't a perfect example  Woz never wanted to be anything other than the tech guru that he is and actually NEEDED Jobs    But it's enough of a fair comparison that you can see how this dichotomy would work   Any CEO worth their salt will WANT some ownership interest in the firm   this is also a good thing    it keeps them motivated   So you'd have to be willing to do this   The downside  of course  is that you're no longer in control   Sure  you could give yourself the Chairmanship role on the Board  for example  and keep that power  which is recommended    But day to day operational concerns would sit with someone else    and  most likely  someone who has the business acumen to worry about the D2D   Other folks are recommending the complete exit   I'm not always sold on this   You built this baby from the ground up    so staying with it  especially if you still like the technical aspect of what your firm does  is a good way to keep yourself intellectually active   Ultimately  though  the key is to do what makes you happy   If you aren't happy  your work will suffer  which will impact your firm today   and your mental health will suffer  it seems it already is    Congratulations on your success   Good luck with your choice How did you ruin it  How was everything going great Join us over at r mommit we will love to talk to you there Yeah I need a couch potatoes of sorts  I do work long hours but like I said my fiancé and I have opposite schedules so the dog won't be completely alone all the time  Are they active when they want  My moms Catholic too  I feel your pain homie Hey  It's hard to say whether something has happened to you but what you describe sounds a little unusual   Do you have any memories of your early childhood  Do you remember certain things  people   specifically   I also started masturbation really young and I also somehow connected it to some forms of punishment  not sure for whom though   So it might be that you're blocking some memories  but maybe you just experienced masturbation and sexuality in a different way than others do  it's a wide spectrum   You respect animals now  so that shows it wasn't anything permanent or evil   Maybe find a therapist to find out about possible blocked memories  Also you could think about exploring your sexuality in a different way  I mean  there are many ways people live theirs  if you're into the whole 'dominance  punishment  etc    There's nothing wrong with that as long as it's consensual  Oh my god hun  I am sorry this has happened to you and your family  Losing loved ones is inevitable  The worst part is most of the time we can't prepare for when it will happen and throws us all off guard  Shocks us and breaks us down  Look to the good memories when you can and ask yourself what would you father want from you is he was still here with you  Possibly just your happiness  Stay with your loved ones and stay close for now  18Wow you sound like me  Similar age  all  yes all my friends now have girlfriends and are all pretty serious and settled  When ever we socialise they always bring the girls so its couples  up to the point where i dont go out anymore because i feel so uncomfortable   I hope 2017 is a better year for you and me bothYea but I knew many of the people  is there something that was kinda driving them away from me  was I boring I don't have a lot of friends but the few I have are close   They all got married within the past few years  It's an unfortunate part of growing older     I guess the good news is now that they are all married  I won't have to go to any more weddings alone Hi there  First point   congratulations at driving to your own success  it seems like a legendary effort  Nothing can take this away from you  you have done awesome things  Building a business of that size here in  au is amazing   The meetings  the grind  it is  and will always be relentless  Scaling a business is difficult  and there is so much mundane stuff that needs to keep happening  it wont go away    Some people are saying to cash out  but if you are passionate about your business  you are not necessarily going to want to do that  It's your baby    So  think about the bits you dont like doing and delegate  You can run the company  but still have a CEO to do the day to day CEO stuff  Work on a general charter  add some middle management  It comes with a small cost  but will steady the business   im a long time senior middle manager  what we do is put in and maintain that governance so the exec can go do the exec stuff without stressing about the BAU stuff     Well done and good luck Tbh I think that's why we FA's fail over and over again  We should not try harder on anything but burning all the small but yet standing bridges we got left won't help us out reaching any decent goals that might be in your reach  My goal 2017 is to eat less and quit tobacco alcohol  will I be an underachieving  kissless  guy with low confidence income this year as well  Yup but giving up everything will just lead to even more severe depression that might lead to suicide in the end    Keep fighting fellow robots When I'm by myself  if I'm thinking through a conversation or monologue or whatever  eventually I'll whisper out a sentence of it  and then I'll reflexively  seriously  no idea why  append "  he said" to the end of the sentence  It's like I'm instinctively trying to disown that I just did that   I hate that I do this  because it feels so odd  but I literally can't make myself stop  I'm just glad it seems to  only  happen when I'm alone  though I cringe thinking of the day when I only  think  I'm alone and someone overhears me being weird holy SHIT     i just saw that picture and WOW   if OP is FA  the rest of us are fucked Thank you  it's incredibly difficult to admit that I cannot do this without help and it's incredibly difficult to realize that this is not my fault  I hope you are getting the help you need and are on your way to recovery and happiness   hugs Dude  I'm 17 and I'm balding  It started when was about to turn 16 and I was  shattered   15 was no age to worry about thinning hair  bald spots and growing your hair out so that you could hide them  But that's what happened  And I stressed about it  Which lead to  Nothing  It didn't change the circumstance whatsoever  so what's the point worrying about it  I know it sucks  but that's the way it is    Don't sweat it too much    I'm the same way  I dunno if this will apply to you  but I have Aspergers and I can initially force myself to be more interactive in social situations but eventually my focus and effort diminishes naturally and then I just kind of zone out into my own world and thoughts  I haven't figured out a solution to this behavior for me yet People fail semesters all the time  I failed two things this past year and I know many people who fucked up at least once    College is harder than most think and if you slip up once it could screw you over later  Most important thing you need to remember is that you're not stupid  I told myself that and it only made shit worse    As to whether or not it will influence your future studies depends on many things like the degree you're planning on doing  your school marks  how badly you failed  the university rules etc etc    A good place to start would be to email someone at the universities you're planning on going to and finding out if you can continue your current degree with them and if you'll need to reapply for college    Unless there's something like academic dishonesty standing in your way I see no reason why you won't be able to continue at a new university    Best of luck man  Just keep a level head and things should be fineHate to be Mr  Center of Attention and all     but oh my god this sounds like something one of my old best friends would write to me  Same situation  I always gave advice for practically nothing      What are the freaking chancesObvious is good  Girls need the confirmation or question anything  Just go for it  There's people on this sub over 50  There's an alternate sub for 30   We've heard the same spiel a million times whenever one of the posts here hits r all   Don't assume that  Tell us how it goes yeah This is perhaps a question your doctor can answer better than anyone else I feel your pain  Truly i do  Depression and anxiety is a bitch and something that I also struggle with  I certainly am no expert at giving advice but I can say one thing that's helped a lot lately is keeping a journal of my thoughts and feelings  it's helped work through a lot of problems and has helped me make some tough decisions  I dunno    maybe it can help you too    I've been through college Math Calculus and in my opinion if you get into it it can actually be pretty fun and rewarding  Definitely not as fun as four months in SE Asia haha    Hang in there  friend  Making this post was a good idea cause I know just writing all that down got you thinking even harder about it  I hope your new years is better than the eve   Sounds like your mom is getting frustrated with you being sick   Welcome  btw   New Year's day is going ok   Danger made breakfast and we went for a walk and now the baby is napping   New years eve I was asleep by 1030  Danger stayed up so he could see if he could see any fireworks  no    This forum contains mostly depressed people who never had a girlfriend and or have no friends  This is usually the primary cause of the depression  Occasionally  people make threads that have a "funny" way to demonstrate FA to make themselves and others feel better  There is a reason why suicide links are on the right side  Most  not all  of the people are depressed from what I have seen Thanks ill try it today Last thing  If you ever need someone to listen to you when you're feeling depressed feel free to send me a PM  Like i said i'm going through it too and sometimes it helps to just have someone you can't rant to  Self care  never  means selfishness  You can't take care of anyone else unless you take care of yourself first  especially not your husband or your child I probably don't qualify to answer this  but  oh well  I'm a "normie" but I've always had near crippling social anxiety  As a little girl  the thought of going to school and being with people I didn't know made me cry every morning on the way there  I somehow managed to make friends along the way  probably because they pitied me  So  going into teenage years  what do a lot of us do  Get jobs  I worked retail and could not handle approaching customers  Like shook and stumbled over words and ran away at the quickest chance   I don't know how I got the job   My therapist gave me very similar advice you all read here regularly  "Start by just putting yourself in a public place  Get used to being looked at  possibly being interacted with  Then  when you're comfortable there  then try just saying hi to a person that walks by" things like that and take your interactions to another level  Exposure  It worked  It really worked  It took MONTHS but retraining your method of thinking is never quick  but it has the most out lasting result of anything else  like medication   I still feel little shakes and my temperature rise when I'm in conversations with people I don't know  but the desire to flee has completely left  So the advice sucks in the sense that it's not an instant thing  You'll get rejected  or people can be assholes and just be like "get the fuck away from me"  And part of the experience is learning how to handle the negative reactions  That might actually be the hardest part  It's not good advice to find a partner directly  But if you have anxiety talking to people  it's a great place to start  If you can train your brain to be comfortable with conversing with all types of people  male  female  young  old  maybe it will be less nerve wracking when you're trying to talk to a person you're interested in  Thanks Ok  by "gamer" I just mean someone who plays games non casually     casual games don't count 11  11  It's not about the type of games that makes someone a casual gamer or not  it's about their dedication to the games they play   If someone is obsessed with Candy Crush and spends every waking minute thinking about it and spends all of their free time playing it even when they have alternative forms of entertainment available to them  then I would consider them a "gamer " However  if they only play the game when they're on the shitter and can't do anything else  I wouldn't really consider them a "gamer " just someone who plays games casually     yeah  there was such little content for women that they had to invent a word for games geared towards women  I don't think they invented the word just because of this  I think they needed a word to define games that were basically the opposite of bishojo gal games that were targeted towards men That actually helped alot  its nice to have a visual example I do not and choose not to believe superstitions like these  To me its ridiculous  but it is a good excuse to kiss someone if you never had  Maybe if you were lucky  you could get that first kiss with some drunk lady on NYE   i was overwhelmed with an indescribable amount of sadness and grief while i watched people cheering and embracing their loved ones under a dazzling spectacle of beautiful pulsating colors that symbolized happiness  joy and a fresh start  while i sit silently alone beside a tree trying to hold back tears in a park that was mostly surrounded by happy couples and families   This is so poetic   and so horribly sad   Perfect way to describe it I would add too that sticking around for someone else  at least for me  was actually detrimental   I felt trapped and eventually resentful of the people who cared about me  If they cared so much  wouldn't they prefer I no longer be suffering  So doing it for myself became the only way to recover You telling yourself that is make whatever probability she likes you back zero  At least try  if you get rejected you will not get older wondering what if I was bigger and more shredded than him at my peak a couple years ago  I think girls appreciate a nice body  but they also want a beautiful face  confidence  and vibrant personality to go along with it  1000s of hours in the gym won't magically fix everything Can you elaborate more   Did they point blank say "not interested in dating but can you do x"   If so  that's fucked It bothers me a lot  I still put myself out there and try to be social  Sitting in my room all day prevents me from seeing the sadness and couples  but it does nothing to actually fix the problem  I find that over time it starts to bother me slightly less  Maybe I am adapting to the pain Yeah  going in public sucks     As a guy losing his hair  I look at every guy and get jealous of their hairline   I look at women and think every single one of them is out of my league   And I look at couples and just feel sadness Why don't you just keep the same name   I live in the US and while I do have a house number  everyone refers to it by the name it was given 100     years ago   FWIW  it's called Millstone Girls are just as horny as men they just aren't as explicit about it because of biological reasonsSame  Lots of abuse in my family and amongst close friends   it never gets any easier to understand  I'm glad you see it was not your fault  and had the savvy to get out before it got even worse  Not that what happened was remotely better Well you're not the only one  I'm a guy  19   only reason I masturbate is to get rid of the urge  I just try to finish as quickly as possible and I'm done  I think it's a waste of time yet I still do it 17 years old is ridiculously young  Honestly may not even count as FA  Lets say you start liking girls at maybe 14  You have been alone 3 years and its not much  You have not even begun college yet  I would just focus on improving yourself before college  I am 24 and there are others on here that are 30  and still FA Cold approach won't unless you look like Ryan Gosling   Otherwise you're a creep Children are bastards  They drain your youth and vigour and keep it for themselves  Mine just

appointment will help you to get in a better place  It only has to be short term until you feel better and decide how it's best to support your own mental health and your family  I had a lot of therapy and a mental health team when I was pregnant  At one point I was so panicked I wanted to give the baby to my mother for a year so she could make sure he was okay      If you can try to have

and then when my thyroid got wacky the bloodwork increased in frequency again  As for dosage  please take this with a grain of salt because my memory is very poor and I also think I might have been an anomaly   I was SEVERELY overweight while I was on lithium  so I think I was on a very high dose at around 300mgs  but I'm not entirely sure  However  I noticed a change even on my low dose  I think that was 15mgs  and I was at a normal weight then    So if it works for you  you might be able to go in at a very low dose and maybe avoid side effects  Perhaps I was just sensitive to the stuff       Not to sound weird  but have you tried ECT  It's both terrible and not at the same time  It didn't work for me but I've heard it can do wonders for some people and it's NOT like it is in the movies  at all  If your an FA I recommend staying far away from social media  All it does is takes all the things a FA does not have and shoves them in your face  I only use it for the groups that are on there for information and thats it Exercise  go for a run walk  hike  Sometimes a high intensity workout is a great stress relieverI think the internet really fucked unattractive people   Nowadays there's really no barrier on distance   Having 3 genuine friends is better than none at all  Cut the fake ones out of your life immediately I'm going to have to tell him because I really don't want him resenting me    Thanks   He is just upset because he did not get as far as you did  He is still likely kissless  That to me is a huge step forward  You are almost borderline FA You want that to be

I am a loner    I have about 3 friendsAre you the type that gains energy by being with others  or gains energy by being by yourself   If you're the latter  you could be an introvert   I'm similar   when I'm with others  even with very close friends  I get exhausted if I'm with them for extended periods of time   My means of regaining my thoughts and my composure is finding a way to excuse myself to be alone  like going on a walk or running an errand  like getting more food for the get together   Any activity that requires energy requires a breather or two  and socializing isn't any different I've had disgusted looks  people cross the street to avoid me  I've been taunted and mocked  I definitely don't feel welcome Smoking shouldn't change the fact that you like the girl  even if you don't

I was younger  I tried to get into vore  giantesses  stuff like that  Basically  anything remotely similar to what I was feeling  I looked into it  Vore tends to be a little too furry animal centric for me  GTS stuff wasn't right either  My fantasies were are really quite dark  it was only the most realistic stuff that would scratch my itch  When I was a teen  my go to stuff was specifically horror films that dealt with cannibalism  Green Butcher  Delicatessen  Silence of the Lambs    the opening scene of Red Dragon with the orchestra was played so often I'm surprised I didn't melt the DVD  I practically bust a seam when the Hannibal series was announced    I feel as though I'm not  ashamed     it's nothing I can help  it's gone on for so long  it's integral to me  like any other kink  It was that I just needed to tell someone  It's kinda depressing knowing that no one in the world  not even my boyfriend  who I tell everything  doesn't know the full story behind who I am  I feel that there's a chunk of my personal story I have to keep secret  because no matter how close your relationship is  you can't quite gauge how the other person will react  When people ask me what made me get into criminology  or psychology  or any other innocent question like that  I have to lie     I'm just happy now it's off my chest and at least someone knows  I am sorry for existing  This part really pisses me off   OK  you don't like the way someone looks   There's a lot about our looks that we can control and a lot that we can't   You can't control your basic bone structure and if you end up with the kind of skin condition that needs a doctor it takes so long to clear up etc  etc  etc    But that's no reason to treat someone like their existence is criminal   That's no reason to treat them subhuman for the Crime of Offending Your Eyes   Yet a lot  most   people will   Jesus Christ  fuck normies   EDIT     One time I tried to explain my  I guess self diagnosed  depression to my mom  She said "well  maybe you should go ahead and kill yourself  That would prove my point that you aren't worth it  Go ahead  I always knew you were crazy " She also calls me "fucking retarded" and gaslights me until i freak out and have a panic attack  She likes to pick on me for no reason  and had never in 21 years apologized to me for any of the hurtful things she says  She treats my sister very well  giving her whatever she wants and never criticizing her   If you don't live at home  break off all contact with this woman right now   Yes it will suck in the short run  but in the long run your life will be better   Also  check out the sub  r raisedbynarcissists I will try that out  From my browsing of this sub  whenever the topic comes up  it seems like the majority of the guys here also do not want  just  sex     I haven't seen a poll or anything  but judging from the comments  some guys say just sex is okay  but seems like most replies say they want something more  I have seen a lot of "I just want someone to cuddle or to have emotional support or to love me" from guys in this sub  This sounds similiar to this http   www independent co uk life style health

rather it not go all the time so i understand  Its good that you control the urge and dont want to hurt anybody though    But i think you really should look into understanding why you have those thoughts and urges  At the very least it might be interesting and at best it could help you understand yourself  It might even help another person as most psychologists i dont think fully understand why this exists and the people who have acted on these fantasies have caused alot of pain to families etc   Maybe you could talk to a shrink online anonymously and tell them all this and tell them you want to understand it they may even help you to further studies in this if you found the right one    Hope you have a good new years I have a cat     Should have gotten a dog   Thats interesting   I am very fortunate financially and buy whatever the fuck I want   gadgets  cars  e g   It makes me happy for like one day and then im unhappy again the next   I'd trade it away for a normal life   Well they say truth is the strangest fictionTough love is his field I thought this was old news  Non invasive treatments are always best Thank you  She just said we need to have a talk later  Whatever that means  So we'll seeIt is very difficult to do without looking creepy and manipulative  and it is easily taken out of context  Your best bet is to find people interested in that topic then go with them to public places and chat about it It's not r foreveralone until someone one ups you on how lonely they are Something that helps me is listening to podcasts where people express themselves in ways I find interesting  My prime example is the slate culture gabfest  I've borrowed ways of discussing cultural elements  movies  music  articles  from these guys  particularly being able to challenge ideas and opinions in an inclusive  non controversial manner     In short  listen to interesting people talking about things you find interesting  Let it rub off on you and experiment with trying it out  I don't think my Mum takes me seriously  I made a dirty joke and she said "I thought you were supposed to be asexual "  As if that makes me a pure little flower fairy who can't make a filthy joke once in a while   For reference  the head fell off a reindeer ornament and she out it back on  so I made a joke about her giving it 'head'  Not my best  but yeah    Mums are weird I expressed myself badly   I wasn't upset because mu brother wouldn't go to dinner exactly  I was upset because I tried to use it as an opportunity to start a private conversation about how worried I am for him and got nowhere  I felt helpless and that was what upset me  I don't see what you mean about taling his mental issues personally  of course I'm worried  There is an absolute epidemic of suicide among young men in my country  and there is nothing more terrifying than feeling helpless when someone you love is isolating themselves from the world  My parents can't make him go to counselling  He is already estranged from my fad  if my mam triedto make him he'd block her out too  I just don't know what to do Lakes Oceans and pools are pretty similar  Non moving or slow moving water  You can float on your back anywhere  People usually don't open their eyes in lakes  and don't do it in the ocean  the salt will burn your eyes Besides the default subs  have you seen the great lengths they have gone to express themselves  This is just my opinion  but if she made a list about reasons she likes you  I can't imagine it was as all as smooth and successfully clicking like it may have been for you  I LOVE making lists  and I've not felt the need to make a list about someone I was sure of Yeah they really are haha I know it's not instant  but it makes it far faster  Also if she has the marriage license she can still use it as if she had a greencard for jobs and keeping her from being deported Dogs are VERY adaptive creatures  Most will be able to live in an apartment with no problem  But the number one rule here  and it's a really important one  GIVE YOUR DOG ENOUGH EXERCISE   If a dog is taken out often enough to go for walks or playing fetch in an off hours elementary playground away from people is best for playing until the dog has great manners  it will adapt and thrive  Dogs just want exercise mental and physical  and love  With those two things they will flourish   Another note  I don't know where you live  but if you find a website along the lines of http   olddoghaven org but based in your area  they will adopt out senior dogs AND pay the vet bills  Dogs are the best partners life has to offer  Good luck  Don't forget r atheism I'm actually unsure if I do it myself but I know in the past I've had friends who  when they're in a larger group  would talk to me in a completely different tone than they normally would if we were alone together  It makes you feel like you're not on the same level as the other people in the group or that you don't belong as well With dogs just be prepared to give it a proper amount of exercise every day  Larger breeds tend to get antsy and tear up furniture or other things if they aren't walked enough  If you think you might not be able to give a dog the TLC it needs consider a Cat  Much less high maintenance   And cat's are not dumb as you said in another comment  They just don't give a single fuck about your verbal commands but they can be the most chill and loving animals on the planet  Yes  your depressed  Getting friends helps a lot  Learn how to talk to people  Why don't you want to talk to people  Try to figure that question out  Check out  r nofap   r stopgaming  Looks and confidence I'd say  Tried working on both this past year but I still think it got me nowhere  I don't even know why I bother with self improvement anymore Do some research on foods that enhance memory     Go to the doctor and get your iron and b12 levels tested    You may want to ask for a test to see if you are gluten intolerant as well  because memory and brain function can be affected by a gluten intolerance without ever giving you an upset stomach Just read in general     I've been told I can be eloquent and come off as intelligent  and I really have literature to thank for that  I love reading  and I always have  It really does help you in that it expands your vocabulary  introduces different perspectives  worldviews  and styles themes   Maybe read more news as well   I recently discovered my local paper has an online PDF of its newspaper everyday  I've been keeping up with it daily  and it really is crazy how much you learn  and retain  from doing that  It helps to keep you in the know  so that you can contribute more better in conversations about current events    Maybe try your hand at writing as well   Writing a lot can be good practice in getting your thoughts organized and voiced the way you want them   How do you know that That hurtsDid you try to have sex with her and she refused  I know you said you haven't done it in a month  but did you try and she refused   And what about those pains  Are you circumcised  Otherwise I really don't see how you penis could become sore   When I used to jerk off frequently  a few times a week  I had no problems using my saliva only    Anyways  why don't you try to actually have some sex with her   Next time you could do this  "I will jerk off only if you start taking your clothes off"  Then in the middle of the job you could stop doing it and ask her to do it  then continue talking to her and get her to have sex with you  Maybe you could get a BJ as well   I don't really know how you guys feel tho'  I just hope I helped  Maybe I got you some ideas  As someone who was focused on doing particularly well in high school   I can say the mentality of doing well in hs paid off because getting to college and "switching on" wasn't a problem    Put in about the same dedication and I did fine  Had friends that took a year or 2 to adjust and depending on career aspirations that could be badI've been there  except for having a kid   and frankly one of the reasons I don't have kids is because I was terrified that what you described would happen to me  What has happened to me is I get worse and worse until something makes me cry and I can't stop crying  That's what usually gets me back to the doctor  It's okay  You need help  and you're getting it  Getting to that moment must be a big relief   I have major depression  and my brother is bipolar  I know it took my brother a while to find the right drug combination that didn't make him feel like a zombie    Hang in there    Your psychiatrist will work with you to find the right meds  Be sure to communicate with him or her    Bipolar is different from major depression  but if you think deep breathing might help   here's a great website  http   www xhalr com   that has a visual representation for breathing   Also   here's a nifty self care list  https   www reddit com r TwoXADHD comments 3bg0go selfcare pdf pretty great list to keep handy   to remind you what to do  The link to the list is within this post   Some people think that having mental illness and going to a psychologist or psychiatrist makes a person weak    That's not true    The strong people realize when they need help  and then get that help   Good luck  OP  I hope things work out for you I don't really have anything to say since you're only venting but I would prepare if I ware you for the age 20 30 since legit nearly everyone has a relationship which leads to difficulties making friends and list goes on Of course  I deleted my FB page in 2015  I have a Snapchat account just so I can receive pics from a few friends Vorarephilia sums me up perfectly  I'm just as disgusted by murder and torture as most other people  I don't want to kill  and I don't want people to think that's part of my fetish and that I'm specifically holding back   that's one of the main reasons I only want to talk anonymously     I feel as though I can trace where my fantasies evolved  I've tried to give as much of a potted history as I could in my OP  in my opinion  it was a perfect storm consisting of eating disorders  late sexual development  and a desire to have power over others who upset me     I've thought about it a lot in the years  My interest in true crime and psychology specifically stems from a desire to try and work out what was going on in my head  I wouldn't be adverse to talking to a shrink about it if it helps other people understand I went on a long trip with my friends and at first it was great  I was having a good time and everything was going swimmingly  Then all of a sudden I just got bored and a flip switched and it was like all the energy I had was drained very quickly  When I'm in this state I literally don't even want to speak and I just want to sit somewhere and meditate  I do this often anyway  Pugs are low energy dogs  We have 4 dogs   jack russell terrier  a pug and 2 jugs  a cross of both breeds  The JRT is rocket fuel on caffeine  the jugs are mellow enough  and the pug has to be dragged outside to have a walk  Barking is also at a lower pitch with the pug  Interesting  but good food and shallow pleasures are the only things that carry me along I've always thought I'm on some part of the spectrum  What if that's the reason we're so good at staying committed to a gym routine  I wish I could say something that could actually help with most of the stuff you're going through  I will say being too disabled to function isn't wasting your life   I recommend doing a little bit each day  just enough that you're proud of yourself   I also advise working on understanding your gender identity  If you are trans then it's best to transition sooner rather than later  It's also a good place to start working on getting your life closer to where you want itWell  weren't pigeons are used to deliver messages Thx  I'll try  Kids are indeed bastards  but they are our bastards  Thank you for your support I love hearing from other mothers who have similar experiences  It is refreshing when the negativity of parenting and mental illness can be shared just as openly as the positives and progresses  This is adorable  i'm rooting for you guys I want to tell my family that women are too shallow  but instead i tell them that im way too busy for womenthere is a difference actually  An SJW will stop at nothing to protect the oppressed  noirs  poor blancos  nonviolent druggers  those unable to find work   A numbnuts is just a numbnuts Thank you so much  I really need to hear these things more often  Thank you for the cat referral  That made me laugh Haven't properly been out in public for about a year  but I do remember it being depressing Would the saying "Nothing Ventured  Nothing Gained" work in this situation  The harder your journey gets  the sweeter the reward    I don't know if you would like this  but you might somehow be able to convince the school to let you repeat the semester during summer  I feel there is some way to do this like providing proof you were terminally ill  and needed to focus more on survival God damn I feel exactly the same  Time is speeding up   I have a diploma  I have a decent job and I make enough money at the moment to be happy   but I've been thinking about going to university  purely for the social side  I mean I guess the new skills would be nice  but I feel like I've majorly missed out on the social side   My 'friends' definitely make me feel like I've missed out  they know that I'm a virgin and say stuff like 'oh you would have gotten some poon if you went to uni' or 'maybe you'd have friends if you went to uni'    Talk to him in person privately  Tell him how you feel about the way he's being treated  The fact that someone is even noticing caring will help him majorly  Tell him he needs to get help in the form of a school counselor or anything  Go to that counseling person to make sure he gets help I wish I could apply a million down votes to this post  Like a karmic nuclear bomb I just saw your pic in veganfitness as well  You did awesome progress  Would you mind telling us what programme or routine you used   Her move was bitchy  but I don't think your year should be too awful   just keep lifting  your progress is really amazing  I'm actively lifting for like a year  but didn't really make progress  I definitely need to change something We are leaning towards pugs because A  We both like that breed just in general and B  We get a resounding good for apartment living  The plan is to go to our local pound or humane society and adopt I didnt come out of my room for that very reason  I've been in my room for the most part since Christmas Eve  Ahh thank you so much   This made my night   yeah but people kept eating themI am so incredibly sorry  I've lost a lot of friends to heroin and meth  If you want to talk about it  please feel free to PM me  I'm here for you I already gave them proof  and I am retaking the classes  The problem is I want to switch majors and schools  and having to wait an extra semester  pay an extra semester  is really something I don't want to do Also  hugs Well first you need to find one  Super random tip   search for something on wikipedia and while skimming the text click on any related topic that seems least boring  Continue until you find a topic that is indeed not boring to read about    Does anyone feel the same way   Nope  Life sucks but a shitty life is better than no life at all  People dying every day from terrible diseases  mauled by hippos  starving to death etc At least we have comfortable lives  decent food  video games  whatever  Let's sop it up while we can   Also  maybe we should get a dog I say that every yearIt's vermin not a friggin' puppy Masturbate before she comes over so that you last longer  And make sure your hygiene is good  Don't be awkward while watching the movie  ex  Folding your hands in your lap while sitting side by side with her  if she shows some signs of affection then a little while through the movie maybe try putting your arm around her    All I want out of this life is someone to give all the love I have to          I refuse to settle for just anyone       DOES NOT COMPUTEWhat is it and how much will you be making We both know that's a load of shit because I'm looking right at it Last night at a rave a couple of people  separately  walked up to me to say something  One of them a girl who asked for a lighter  I sensed she wanted to converse  said a few things  I replied to them and asked a thing or two back  Then I didn't know what to say due to mild anxiety nor could I muster the social energy and interest to keep asking her things  even though she looked pretty  When she said something our heads were close to each other and that felt nice  For a moment I wanted a kiss and nothing more but wouldn't know how  When she wanted to leave she said bye and I considered asking for a goodbye kiss but that is probably not considered cool to do as a male   Meeting girls at stuff like this is not for me  I am not sufficiently interested in strangers  only co workers and friends  so I keep to myself or the people I'm with and just dance at parties or concerts  And something like this where a girl says something to me happens maybe once a year and I can't be arsed to be interested in a random stranger  The fact that relationship culture involves this activity to a large extent annoys me  I don't want to find a potential gf in a stranger  much less at loud parties   Think about what you want to say  while you're saying whatever it is you're talking about  You'll probably ramble for a bit but it's OK as long as you get across  And keep your voice clear    Edit  I feel like that too  I don't want to be as quiet but I don't want to say something I don't mean  necessarily Assuming your assessment is correct it sounds like the school isn't giving you the education you should be getting   If you are straight A's then I would say to change to the public school where you might be challenged by what could be better teachers   I had excellent teachers in public school  most of whom pushed and pushed for us to do better and get the most out of our education   I wish I had appreciated it at the time    On the other hand at your age I was shy enough that I'd have rather died than change schools   In my opinion the education is the most important thing  and the variety of experience you get at your age   The more things you do and try and fail succeed at the more options you'll see for yourself later in life in careers places to live hobbies    Good luck  champ   Good for you for being mature enough to think about the education you're getting   I was far too dumb and immature to care about it at your age  Look man  I am an 18 year old boy and I am a virgin as well   Do you know this girl for a long time and she really expects to watch a movie tomorrow or not   If not  from what I heard from my friends  most of the times they barely even watch the beginning of the movie   The fact that you consider yourself "average looking" and that you talked this girl into coming over at your place  makes me think that you really underestimate yourself  It's something that we  the virgins  do pretty often   What I would do if I was you is this  after the movies starts  start kissing her and see how she reacts  If she is okay  screw the movie and keep going  After you undress and so on  pull out the condoms and be like "look  I have something to tell you  I got the V card in my wallet  I feel like I am ready to give it to you  so I want this to be something special"   Then fuck her brains out    In Romania there is a saying  "Hit her like the deaf man hits the church's bell"   BUT   Are you sure you wanna lose your virginity to this girl  After I turned 18  in June  2016  my cousin arranged a 2 v 2 sort of date with two girls  I could have had sex with any of them  but I did not really like them  so I said pass  So I decided to wait for my special pumpkin  D   If you still wanna bang  make sure you are clean and open the damn' window before the girl arrives    To be honest  I never thought I would make a fool of myself if I would tell a girl that I am a virgin  Who knows  maybe your girl will even enjoy fucking a newbie   Don't forget to tell us how it went   Hit her like the deaf man hits the church's bell  Police  starting salary is 23 000  will rise with increments until I reach 46000 after 19 years  With allowances i'll realistically be getting an extra 7 000 a year on top of the base salary  The other job is starting salary 24 000 with no increments although it gives me the freedom to study part time too    i'm aware that I might be crazy for walking away from a career with a very good guaranteed pension  I'm just not sure it's something I want to commit 30 years of my life to  Any advice is really appreciated   You have a guaranteed job and pension     I have an interview for another job this week in an industry that i'm very interested in working in  however  the benefits and money aren't nearly as good  From what I could determine  I would certainly opt on the side of security   If the salary and benefits were superior for this other opportunity  I would see some point in this   It's not as if you're going to be entirely prevented from pursuing the domain of interest at some point in the near  or distant  future once you've secured this guaranteed job   It just may never generate your  primary  source of income   Best of luck  and I hope that this assists in some manner  refused to take meds because I didn't want to be a zombie    I just want to touch on this  I'm on meds for my own mental health issues  I know being tied to a pill is scary and I resisted it for the longest time myself   My biggest piece of advice is to be critical of how they make you feel  Don't be afraid to bug your doctor  Once you decide you don't like a drug for whatever reason  call the doctor and tell him her you want something different   I changed meds four times before I found one I could live with  It wasn't easy  but it was worth it  It's not a magical cure  but it levels me out enough that I can manage the rest   You can do this  The hardest part is often just telling someone you need help and you did that on your own   We're all rooting for you    Boo fucking hooThanks for reply it's much appreciated  Although I should have specified that it's police work so other options pretty much go off the table once i'm in  It's going to be OK   You're going to be OK  I understand EVERY feeling that you wrote about  I'm a stay at home mom to 3 girls   I have some serious health problems   my husband just doesn't seem to notice   care   whatever    Savor the good days  and the bad ones will bring you to your knees and push the envelope  You are human  life isn't perfect and sometimes shit is fucked up    You are a power house  a succulent wild woman  and I know that this may sound silly  but take the time to get dressed   put make up on  on the rough days pick the most obnoxious  loud  vibrant red lipstick and rock it    Realize that there's many people out here who understand  struggling  and going through shit    Kudos to you for realizing that you need help   something isn't right    Have your thyroid checked   Mine was always on the low end of normal  10 years later  I'm raising my kids   down in the depths of hell  going on year 3  round 4 of battling cancer  No one seems to notice or give a fuck    My mom took her life this past August  and as her child   I'm devastated     as a person   I understand that she just couldn't anymore    Please   if you feel like you want to talk   PM me    Remember   You are a succulent wild woman    Big hugs and always remember   you don't have to fake the smile  Go to the park  exercise  spend time with your family    And video games everyone on the internet isn't haven't a great of time as you think they are  First things first  I'm so sorry for your loss  My dad is my best    well  I'm going to be truthful and say my only friend and I don't know if I would be able to follow the advice that I'm going to give you now    Okay  the first thing you have to do is take a minute  Take five or ten or thirty minutes actually  That may seem like a short amount of time  but you're going to get more minutes later  You can do whatever you want in that time  cry  pray  curse God   it's up to you    When you've done that  I'm sorry but you're going to have to look out for your younger siblings  Sit with them  hold them  make sure that they know that you're there for them  If they need to cry tell them that that's alright  it's natural  and if you need to cry with them then that's perfectly fine too  It's the same thing if your mother or anyone else in your family needs it because  while you've got to look after everyone  you've got to be looked after too  And that's what families are for  looking out for one another   But don't neglect alone time if you need it and make sure to respect other people's alone time if they ask for it  Likewise  if someone isn't obviously sad don't throw judgement  People grieve in their own ways  And if you need to speak to your father  don't feel ashamed  There's a reason that people pray  even if they don't believe in a god    Don't neglect yourself  think about the good times with your dad  and remember that you are not alone  Have you ever considered trying a sport  When I was your age I would release that urge by going to the gym or jogging   What do you think about that   Everybody  and I mean EVERYBODY has some kind of fantasy down there that they never want coming to be  I have one  my GF has one  my BFF has one  it's always there  The best option is to try and find something to distract you  Something that you like more  that doesn't depress you  Just try anything new that pops into your head  Eventually you'll find something that blows your mind  without depressing you Remember you are the CEO  You have the ability to empower change that you need  For  1  change up board meetings  identify why they are a chore and see if there sia nything you can do  2 invite a friend  Your friends would probably love a trip with you  3 you should have far more time available then this  6 what employees are you firing  You should have managers that you manage who do that  This is an absolute true though  it sucks but sometimes it has to be done  For  8  I have a case study from a human relations book I want you to read  I'll PM it to you She asks specifically to watch me  Sometimes she's across the room when she asks and tells me to stay where I am  She  pulled away the other night when I tried to hold her in bed   The last time I initiated oral sex with her she literally started talking to my penis  Like how people talk to their dog  It was a huge turn off  Didn't even finish and I ended up going to take a shower   I'm cut to answer your question  Have you ever had an hour  masturbation session days in a row  Feels like I'm literally punching myself in the nuts by the end of it   She's disinterested in normal forms of sex  She needs therapy I'm sure  I'm just afraid how she's going to react when I bring it up look uhh at least you got a date  I think she was just wierd  She matched you  she knew that tinder is not for fucking "friends"  she then went on a date with you  said yes to a second date   She knew you did not want to be "just friends" in my opinion from the beginning  she just    idk  got cold feet for whatever reason  You look great though  saw the pic  so shouldn't take you long to get the fuck out of this place forever  Thanks for the reply  I wasn't up for asking this question out loud  in person with someone else If they sell your DNA to insurance companies  good luck getting any insurance if they find out you have a disease that will show in several years  Make sure you read the fine print  Do they own your DNA  Can they sell it You think you would be happier doing the other job  I would say if the other job fits you lifestyle and makes more money and you have a real deep feeling that you would get it  then go for the other job  If you have better skill sets  becoming a cop will be a dead end  I know I sure as hell wouldn't want to do 30 years as a cop What I mean is that I want to give my love to someone but I'm not going to just settle for some random John who will waste it  This  or maybe she is similar to an ex gf of mine who has severe commitment issues   She also made lists and had an extremely hard time "settling" on one person   Like if I wasn't the exact perfect match she couldn't stand the thought of not keeping her options open   She claimed to love me  but always had one foot out the door   She also has extreme self esteem issues and also had tendencies to self sabotage because when she did manage to convince herself I was right for her  she then fixated on her not deserving to be loved and put up walls   I bring this up because different people have multitudes of "issues" or baggage and this could all stem from some strange hangup if her own that she needs to deal with    And for her to drag you on a ten hour drive to spend new year's with her family  and then dismiss you so coldly suggests to me that there is more to her than meets the eye     So with the little information that I have  I say that it sounds more like either she has some shit to sort out  or there just wasn't a spark for her   But again  to send you packing on a ten hour drive home on New Years Eve is not something that I think level headed  caring people do unless there was some bigger issue at hand   Sorry this happened to you OP   Dating can be rough   You will find someone good I am not a professional swimmer but I think everyone will agree when I say that it's WAY easier to swim in an ocean rather than swimming in a pool   Salty water tends to keep you up  I am not saying it's easier to get from point A to point B in the middle of the ocean  But it's easier to float  Every time I go to the sea I could float on my back all day long  but in a pool I get tired very fast    You should really go to some beach and try swimming in the sea  If you can stay afloat in a pool  I guarantee you can do it in a sea as well and it will seem easier A failure of a mother wouldn't have the strength that you do    Although I should have specified that it's police work so other options pretty much go off the table once i'm in   Then  to warn you  I'm definitely a biased party here  two family members were in law enforcement    That being stated  I know of at least several cases where the security of the job provided them with the opportunities to expand into other industries  it obviously just took some years of investing their time I'm pretty sure the majority of us here would never act this way if you were to talk to us in real life  But inward  the people here are very depressed about themselves because they lack the social validation that most normal people have  And no matter how hard they try  they cannot change it  one summer puberty happened to her and she got incredibly attractive and she refused to speak to me again  I tried  but she always shut me down so she could hang out with attractive people   For me  that's the most depressing item on your list   WTF is wrong with people Kick his ass out  Actions have consequences  He seems to find satisfaction outside of you some I'm sure he'll find some place to stay but he's not worth your timePictures  I seriously don't think anyone can be "ugly"  Gif version  https   www reddit com r ForeverAlone comments 5epqbv nice guys kappa  ref share ref source link Get a calendar and put down your due dates  Check it every day and assure you have enough time to meet deadlines I think it's more than just socialization   I mean  each and every person is the result of thousands of generations of people who achieved some degree of romantic sexual success   How can that not have an impact on one's genes   If you're in america there is no "proper vest tags paperwork" There is no legally recognized or required paperwork  vest  id  tag  certification or registration  For flying the laws are different but i'm just putting that out there to inform everyone else I am so sorry that you had to experience that  I can't claim in the slightest that I understand  and I know coming from a stranger this  won't mean much  but I wish you the best in healing from this  Please take all the time you need to care for yourself I didn't want to post this  but I probably need to    He's manipulating you  it's a guaranteed to get a blow job  Have a serious word with him  and tell him you know why he lied about it  Well  everyone ghosts on Tinder  It's easy to ignore someone than to hurt their feelings apparently  That sounds stupid but it's how people think sadly   FTFYWhat happens if you don't go back No tldr and just a long ass story yet you're seeking advice  Lmao  You're not from around here are you Holy shit you're legit attractiveRejection is rejection  It blows  Nothing much we can say will help    However  I am certain there isn't anything wrong with you  Any quality that this person didnt like about you might be the thing that makes the "right" one want to be with you  A relationship takes 2 people  You may have been all in but she wasn't  Nothing you could have done would have change that    All you can do is put on some Sinatra  pour 4 fingers of scotch or bourbon and drown it out till these feelings pass    There will be others  One you find the right one all of the others will feel so insignificant  If she may not known she was being filmed I would definitely bring it up with her  That's my plan for the next little while  if I could lose a solid 30 40lbs  I'll be good to go  As far as cold approaches go I'm going to just join some clubs and meet people through other people  cold approaches are not fun to me anymore  Thanks for the help my man I have this problem too so it's very possible he's just being honest  It's depressing but sometimes friendships do just fizzle out as people change  This reminds of one of my similar situations where I talked to a person regularly but then conversation started dying out  we did have a few fallings out but I just moved on  as hard as it was  Trust me  you'll find a new friend  you just need patience and an open mind Hello twin  I have had the exact same problem as you  addiction to video games  Games like Skyrim just take me away and I never can put it away  The best way to conquer this is by doing one thing  give your controller to your parents  This will help you out a lot  I dont have many friends and usually resorted to video games for entertainment  or having anything to do in general  My grades went down  and made me very lazy   So I decide to give my parents my controller during the weekdays  They hide it from me until the weekend comes  but of course I have to finish my homework before I get the controller  I don't recommend completely removing video games from your life because it won't help  what will help is limiting it  and if you enjoy it so much you will feel motivated to do your work because when you do it you will be able to play Man  I hear you  I have nothing super constructive or helpful or encouraging to tell you except that you are not alone    Though not on the same level  I'm struggling too  My depression and anxiety has been the worst it has ever been for the past couple months and it's awful  Even though I have been in therapy consistently for over a year  it's so goddamned rough  Depression and anxiety are   awful  it feels impossible to escape the demons when they are in your own head    I'm so sorry this is happening to you  but you are incredibly strong for taking your health into your own hands and taking this first step for yourself  I know a smidgen of how you must feel  and my heart goes out to you  I wish I had something better to say  but I know what helps me most when my mind goes to dark and scary places is simply knowing I'm not alone  You are not alone  maybe he is lonely and wants to spend time with you or in crowds  He may be forming an unhealthy attachment to you  I would talk to him about it and suggest therapy if he is strugglingIf it's any consolation  my dad threw me out of the house because he caught my mom cheating on him  I lived out of my car for a month before one of my friends found out and let me crash on his couch  It was shitty  I had only been sober for less than a year  I'm a cocaine addict  but pot friendly  and I couldn't tell my parents that  I had lost my scholarship to a community college  really  who does that  and was the lowest I've ever been  I'm telling you  it gets better  I've come such a long way since then by recognizing that it was a low point and I was unhappy  You'll get through this  and you've got a much better chance than I did  okay you say your mental problems are partly due to your debt  As advice i would give you to set realistic goals  with the 668 dollars you have left you will still have to pay the interest on your debt  food and clothing for as far as i can see  i think a reasonable goal could be to try to keep 200 in paying of rent every month   You will have to see how this goes  is it is really easy you might wanna make it a bit higher so you are faster out of debt  if it is to hard you can adjust it down but this number must always be positive     I don't know the interest on your credit card  but i assumed you have an extremely high interest on it  probably around 16 percent or something  i calculated with 20  that you would be paying 300 dollars per month in interest  Which is insanely much  Try to pay these off  Even if this means you have to lend from a family member or something    Do not take payday loans  these are even worse     Some things you might want to figure out  is it possible to get rid of the car  623 a month is a lot  Do you need it or can you handle with public transportation  Also the phonebill is extremely high  you might find a way to cut that back a little   With your mental state it might not be wise to do an extra job  but you could still consider doing one extra just to get out of this debt    I don't know about the help that there is provided in canada for students  but I don't think it is a good idea to go spend money on education when you are so far in debts  However it depends a bit on how the educational system is in canada   What you still can do  is to just start writing and reading more  You have an internet connection so you can read till infinity  You can also go to a libary and lend some books  just depending on taste  If you want to do something in journalism  than you should start it now as a hobby while you try to get out of this debt   I hoped i helped with all your questions  if you have any questions remaining i would love to hear about them Make sure your penis smells good  your entire body smells good  you shave    If you dont want to make a fool out of yourself just try and talk about anything that interests her  If she leads you on eventually start being more flirty  If you end up kissing her  you'll be able to tell if she wants it or not Definitely not a myth  My last 6 encounters have been like this  Meet at a party  alcohol  flirting  let's go back to "your" or "my" place  3 of them I saw a few more times  the others  just 1 night stands  The ages of these woman were 27  28  30  40  37  23  Haven't actually done any  Ha  in my head I picture you at your neighbors' and you check your phone and see that comment and you suddenly start backing away from people nervously  Maybe next year you should properly host a party with maybe 5 close friends  then maybe it won't be as awkward as this years Aw  well that is a reflection on them and not you   Unfortunately  some people are just terrible people   Since I'm ugly  I understand getting ridiculed by random strangers   I just tell them off and ignore them   Don't let assholes make you feel like you have to hide away and don't deserve to enjoy life   You do deserve it  not matter what some insecure losers say   I don't know if you're a girl or guy   But  if you are a guy  sometimes girls will cross the street to avoid guys because some girls are taught that's a safety precaution   Maybe you could try going out with some friends who could help stick up for you and potentially discourage people from harassing you   Either way  those people don't have a right to treat you that way or hinder your ability to go outside I mean  why are we soziolized that way  Because finding a mating partner is our biological value for society  We should feel bad for beeing alone so we get a partner and do our biological duty  Ofcause not everyone can succeed  Such "motivaton" pics upset me because they don't help me  they just seem ignorant She petified you I still make tons of mistakes in my job and I just deliver papers  I also suck at FPS games as well but I choose to do a different hobby that not many people do and that's playing the bass  its more impressive since not many people do it that I know of  I'm going to pipe in my "me too " Like you  it's just as if a switch gets flipped  Nothing anyone says causes it  it just comes out of no where  and that's it  the fun time is over  There is nothing that causes it  I can step away to use the rest room  enjoying myself  and walk out of the rest room wanting to leave  so I know it's not anything that anyone present has said   I am so bad  I have on  many  occasions just left  without saying a word to anyone  And by many  I mean most times I go out with people  I'll take note if anyone's looking at me  and if no one is  I'll just walk away and go home Some years ago  I injured my hand  The night it happened  I was in a lot of pain  but I iced it  and did my best to ignore it  Because I couldn't see any bruising  I thought it was just a strain  I suffered with a painful and very swollen hand for nearly a week  and when the swelling finally decreased I saw the truth  my hand was purple and green and crooked  I'd broken the darn thing  So I went to the doctor  Got some x rays  They put me in a cast  I wore it for seven weeks  And then my hand was better    My hand had been hurt  I wanted to be strong  but I couldn't fix it by myself  There was no shame in my seeing a doctor  There was no shame in my needing to wear a cast  That's what casts are for  There was no shame in my needing help   Please understand  it is the same for you  There is no shame in your needing help   We don't tell people with broken bones to "tough it out"  and broken bones are  simple  compared to what goes on in our minds  Yet for some reason society tells us that if we are unable to fix complicated mental health problems alone and in silence then we are weak   This isn't true   Sometimes we need help  and that's fine  Sometimes we need to wear a cast  Please  go find the cast that will help you become healthy again    Listen   You're not a failure    You are human    You are brave    You are strong   Part of your strength is in realizing that you need help  and in taking steps toward securing it  So many people never make it this far  You are strong   Please know that this stranger is thinking of you When doing stuff with currents DO NOT GET COCKY  Other than that yeah  also oceans and rivers are also made from H2O   So my Flat contract says I can't stay there unless I'm registered with the uni  and while I am while on leave I'm not if I don't go back  obviously   Living with my parents again may not be an option  I don't think they'll take me in and mental health services in my home area are virtually nonexistent   Also I'd be left with only the money in my pocket because obviously Student Finance isn't a thing if you're not a student   So the plan is to find a job  enough to get a place in the city where I study  because literally all my friends and connections are there and support is actually available    Of course the likelihood of that working seems like it's 0  in which case I have no idea You are so articulate Did you ever consider being more dominant  To be honest  I am not that experienced when it comes to girls  18 year old virgin  but I answered to you because I thought you could use the advice of someone who sees your problem from "the outside"    You said you are the only one working  Since your friends said she is "out of your league"  do you think you are like a "sugar daddy"  Or you don't make that much money    From what I know  IF she has a problem then there has to be something that caused the problem in question   What did she say when you asked her "why do you wanna keep watching me masturbating "   Do you communicate enough  I mean  she seems to be kinda selfish  Did you ever tell her that you want to have sex and that you got tired of masturbating  Did you tell her that you have needs too and that she is being selfish   Just try to talk more    And to answer your question  when I was 14 16  can't remember precisely  I remember I had a few masturbating streaks which were way longer than yours and I don't recall any pains  And from what I have read so far all over the internet  I don't see any good reason to circumcise my kid  I don't want to derail this topic  but I hope you will at least think twice before doing that to your children as well    How's that your fault  You started a conversation normally and you didn't get a response  it might be that she doesn't go on facebook  much or that she's busy with something  Call your Drs office  don't be embarrassed r sex  New throwaway maybe   Also  i think they have a faq kinda thing   Wow  I never expected this to be as big of a post as it has gotten  I really appreciate all of the kind words of encouragement and support from everyone it may not feel like it makes a difference but it really makes me feel like I have a wonderful internet family there for me  I have been trying to reply to everyone who commented and I don't want to leave anyone out because all these comments have made me feel so loved and meaningful and you all deserve a sincere thank you    For those of you who are currently experiencing similar struggles and similar inadequacies or who are just in need of some love please feel free to message me  we are in this together and no one should feel alone in this  Mental illness sucks and it is incredibly hard to admit you may need help or that you can't do it all on your own  If you are considering suicide PLEASE call the suicide hotline in your area or call 911 visit the local ER for help  There is no shame in admitting you are struggling or feel alone in your pain because  as I've found today  we are not alone in our experiences  You are loved and you matter to this stranger    I want you all to know that I love each of you and I thank you all so very much for your kindness  Thank you so much for caring  seriously  thank you all so much  great advice from Jewst  Also  if you're ever in the presence of people who are bullying him  you can publicly stick up for the kid  If you have have social capital  ie if people tend to follow what you do  or listen to what you have to say  then this sort of thing can be impactful  Something as simple as "Hey  that's not funny" could shut a person right up    It's awesome that you want to do something to help  School bullying can be catastrophic if the victim feels alone  You're good  thank you Just stop doing stuff that isnt productive while you should be Fap THEN shower  The other order may leave you sweaty and smelling like jizz  I have 3 friends but it doesn't mean I see them all  all the time  To admit and then write this took courage  and I applaud you for that   It makes me think you must be a great mother to be able to do it   Parenting is tough and it sounds to me like you are on the right track  even if it's bumpy as hell right now   Good luck  and get well Thank you for the advice I'm not looking forward to finding one that works for me  it's  going to be a hard time consuming effort to find myself again but I think it will be worth it in the end  Thank you for caring I feel sorry for you and your penis     And your dogs    I agree  I love how even with anonymity  most people here choose to be nice  Check out  r casualconversation sometime I've had to deal with this all through high school and am having to continue it through my senior year of college    I'm sorry for all the others that have to go through this  It's a hard thing that  those friends who do this to us  never understand I don't have any friends  I'm sorry you've had to go through this stuff too  you're right people can be really horrible and when it does happen it just kind of leaves an imprint in your psyche  Thanks for the advice man What kind of interest also   I think this is relevant as i  m  have a  f riend i banter a lot with  Its frustrating to be mistaken for a couple when you dont have a romantic sexual interest Some positive data about alternative treatment would be just wonderful    a lot of what is available as herbal treatments is very likely more toxic  less effective but available without a prescription and muuuch cheaper   I bought some Valerian root the other night  I can't afford to go back to a psychiatrist and I am running out of my meds    I personally would greatly benefit from an over the counter antidepressant and anxiety medication  even if they are not terribly effective  Got an idea   Why don't you tell her that you found a porn video of some other friend of your  "Andrea"  and you think that "Andrea" may not know   Ask Amie what she thinks about it and if she thinks it would be good to tell Andrea   Hope you know what I mean  Trust me having a SO is super overrated  Don't value yourself because you don't have a partner  that is so disrespectful to yourself  You have to be happy with yourself before you expect others to be happy with you  People who are alone think that it's depression   relationship   happiness  Where in reality it's depression   self happiness   confidence  And from there you can get into a relationship but you see little value in them    Loneliness is solved by being happy with yourself  not having more people around you  It definitely is  There's no middle ground for me  I either overdo something or don't do it at all  You really should look at your financial situation first  Can you afford to travel where you want  Then you should think what you might do after travelling  If you really want to change professions then that's more learning and that learning could be done sooner instead of travelling  I wouldn't say it's a stupid idea by any means but perhaps getting a god career in a job you enjoy then after settling down you could pack your bags and travel   Just an idea and good luck in whatever you choose   They are low energy  but obsessively devoted    to a point of annoyance  My son got the pug but she shadows me everywhere  licks me to annoyance and will perch on my head when I am sleeping  Look into the pug crosses too  The outbreeding seems to calm their neurotic nature  And they get their feeling hurt deeply and quickly  my sons dog gave me the stink eye for a week when I got mad when she chewed my slippers  edit  Be prepared for a bit of a diva  they don't like long walks but are demanding of attention      read guilt trip  Well  here's to 2017 and the possibilities of something more than just sex coming our way  Cheers    Spot on my man  spot on In all honesty  this is great advice if you're looking for study buddies or platonic friends    nbsp   But as for a potential girlfriend boyfriend  Sure  it'll probably work    if you're good looking  It's only creepy if you're ugly Hang in there OP  Kids are great  they're amazing and raising a child is the greatest thing in the world  but goddamn parenting sucks  It's awful  Sometimes we all want to jump in the car and give the family a big fuck you so we can take a shit in peace  You're not alone in feeling how you do  far from it  Stay strong  get help  be open about how you feel  and don't feel bad about it  You're a great mother and wife if you weren't  you'd have nope'd out long ago  Don't feel alone and don't despair  Get help if you feel you need it  but don't feel bad or ashamed  It's a tough road  but the good parent stays on the road and keeps driving  Stay strong  a lot of internet strangers want you to succeed and feel better To be fair this is definitely not representative of all marriage    Anecdotal evidence can be given for anything  my parents have been happily married and there isn't anything like the above going on in their relationshipThank you  I am so sorry for your loss  I can't imagine what you must be feeling  I hope to find the strength and courage to keep going even when I feel like I can't  It is always going to be a struggle but I really am happy I've made this choice  Why not get a gf by meeting someone through a friend  Most relationships are formed through mutual friends Thank you so much  I'm doing the very best I can for him Everyone is beautiful in their own wayMaybe she's a cum freak and is attracted to it  i still want to be friends  I want to eat all the christmas leftovers in the fridge  but it isn't healthy   Good Luck  but I recommend cutting contact  for now at least May I ask what country you are in  and if there is decent access to mental health professionals there     He is already estranged from my fad  if my mam triedto make him he'd block her out too   Since he is living in their home  they hold all the power   If he doesn't work to work with them  they can ask him to leave It may be to much to handle for them  And thus it´s easier to stop    I´m sorry to hear it happend to you  Thank you so much  You are loved and I hope we both grow together and learn to deal with this the best way we can  That's an effect of the drug too though  it's just as fake as her happiness  Her serotonin was depleted  which is why she felt like crap   You are a hero  What's crazy about being a hero is that it is hard and puts you in fucked up situations  You were the one to stand up for your niece   You made a mistake with Amy  One that is very very common and understandable   You can make it thru this  I know this is sort of an older post  but I just joined the sub and saw it  All the stuff I've seen about mushrooms and anxiety focus on people with anxiety about a specific life problem such as cancer  Has anyone had experience with it when you just have a mental illness that's biological chemical whatever in nature and not caused by anything other than your brain makeup New Years and Valentine's Day are just like any other day for me  I don't feel sadder  Just the regular amount of sad Why not better booze for NYE I attended a family wedding a few months ago  and one of my relatives told my dad that he's going to be a father in law soon  It was inevitable that said relative asked my dad about how I was doing in terms of dating finding a girlfriend    nbsp   My dad immediately gave an embarrassing laugh and said "oh  he'll  me  figure that out eventually  that's something that he has to learn to do on his own"   nbsp   I'm really hoping that my parents are starting to understand that they're not going to have grandchildren Thank you  You have no idea how much everyone's words of love and encouragement have meant to me today  I am doing this for me  I am doing this for my family and I'm doing this because I know if I don't I won't make it much longer  Thank you for making me feel loved  important and strong  I made this same call on Friday  I have not considered suicide  but I understand the sitting there staring at your crying baby  being completely numb  I understand the guilt you feel as well  Fortunately we both seem to have very supportive husbands   Making that call will be the first start to us being the best moms that we possibly can be  I'm here for support if you need it My wife and I got engaged while I was in college  Initially we wanted to wait until after graduation  but decided to move it forward cuz  why the hell not  We loved each other and we didn't want a big blowout wedding anyway  Also  my girlfriend at the time  Wife now  is 4 years older  my parents didn't like that at all   Especially when I was 18 and first started dating   I guess what I'm saying is  don't let anyone  including your parents  decide what you choose in life  If you're perfect for each other and have identified opportunities that will get you and your girl set up better for the future  do it  Be confident and decisive  hopefully your parents will come around and support you    7 years  2 kids  2 states  and 3 jobs later  happily married and my parents couldn't be happier with my "rogue" decisions  Maybe  But that's something you don't tend to find out until the 2nd movie night   Wow  Best Pep talk ever  Thank so much for the advice and I will try my hardest to follow it      This may sound weird  but consider yourself lucky  I wholeheartedly believe that experiences like these give us more context in the wild happy times in our lives  We learn more about ourselves and what's important and it helps drive us  I'm glad you're feeling better about it all Thank you so much  I am doing everything I can to give him the life he deserves and he needs a mama who is around to see him grow up  who can show him how to be strong and kind and loving  He needs me and that is enough for me  Sorry but the brain  not mind  is a neural tissue and not any form of muscle  I am so sorry for your loss  You are not alone I too have had a similar experience I used to punch walls and make my knuckles bleed over stupid things  When I got angry at these things I remained angry the rest of that day  One day after already feeling frustrated my friend tripped me up just as a joke I was furious so I hit him at the time I didn't care I just walked away  However  when I got home I felt horrible my own friend I just punched in the face I looked for help through my parents and close friends on how I could control my anger  They said to stay calm in the situation  ignore whatever is frustrating you and then maybe talk to someone about it later  rather than do something you would regret  2 years later I'm very different my temper is much better and even when I still do get angry I just lay in my room and calm down with some music  If you have any hobbies like gaming or drawing try that when you are annoyed just to calm you down    Hope this helps At least she told you she was not interested  It gives you closure rather than being ghosted See that's part of my dilemma  the only real aspiration I've had is to travel but I know for a fact even though it's currently financially feasible I feel like I'll struggle to get back on my feet when I return She explained to me that watching me masturbate is more fun for her than having sex which is why I've been doing it  But she was never like this before  I don't know what spurned this voyeuristic fetish   I've always made more money than her but she's never had an issue with it   Also we don't communicate enough lately so you're right about that  Lately all I do is work  buy groceries  come home and beat off   I'm going to clean the place up tonight and I'm NOT masturbating for her  Even if she begs and cries   I don't plan on having children  My wife and I have had lengthy discussions about it in the past  So don't worry about that last thing  Although I have heard from my previous doctor that uncircumcised men are at a greater risk of contracting HIV and other sti's  Especially among men who have sex with men  Not sure why that would be but I'm not a doctor Nobody is buying that  Everyone is busy What do you actually love about the environment  There are other environments where people come for a common purpose and are friendly   I tried to become social at raves based on what I read about them  That accomplished very little  and in retrospect it seems like a mistake  I don't know what was wrong  Based on my experience  it's as if the stuff I read about raves were all lies  It's also amazing how little the drugs helped   I'm still surprised and confused by how badly that went  I've had better times at sober group social gatherings a few times since  but far too few times to make a difference in my life overall Thanks man  Ye don't know why she got all surprised when I said I was interested in her  She did the same thing when she asked me out on the first date  she changed her mind in the last minute and I had to convince her to meet me  Someone on this forum told me she would do it again but I didn't listen  They  are  ignorant  Complete and valuable my assYou're not ugly  and I'm not just saying that nor am I trying to sound gay   I'm a dude and yes  I live in the UK   I've seen your posts and stop trying to get others on the internet to validate how you look  If you stay indoors a lot get a gym membership or find a hobby besides from gaming  I seriously hated my life 4 years ago but when I began to excercise and go out more I felt so much better  It doesn't have to be excercise  just find something you like and make a goal  When you achieve that goal you'll feel a lot better in yourself and you won't have a low self esteem  When you go outside  no one gives a shit how you look trust me  I used to feel the same but the more time I spent worrying on how others perceived me the more I wasted my life away  I know how it feels when people look at you in weird ways or snarl  Those people are not worth thinking about and I don't think you'll ever get over that fact but that's life  It's a bitch and you got to grit your teeth and deal with it  You won't die a virgin if you go outside and do stuff  Don't try and eventually they'll come to you  Be patient Thank you for the love  Parenting is by far the most roller coaster ride of emotions I will ever experience and I'm bipolar so that's saying a lot  I love my family and I couldn't imagine my life without them and I can't imagine what theirs would be without me  I need to stick around I need to be that annoying nag of a mother for the rebellious teen years I need to watch him grow up and teach him how to be kind and humble I need to show him how to be strong and what that really means  I appreciate the sympathy  I feel bad for my dogs too  I wish my wife would take them for a walk instead of thinking about my penis all day Thank you  We can do this In the exact same boat  You aren't alone  Have you considered a shih tzu mix  My friend and I both have shih tzus and they are both really good dogs  They don't really shed and they are very loving  I think the only real downside is that their fur kinda does need some maintenance like brushing so they don't get knots and if you don't want them to have super long poofy fur a trip to the groomers can be expensive unless you do it yourself  I'm 100  ready and willing to spoil and love that dog till the ends of the earth  Thank you for confirming that fact that I really want a pug It's so rare to see a comment like this on Reddit  and it really pleases me  I agree completely  Don't take the risks and try to be a stereotypical reckless teen  Be a safe and smart person     I don't have a significant problem with this comparing my life to others stuff  For me the worst part of social media is putting too much of myself into it and expecting too much out of it  I've spent many years interacting with people on Facebook and gotten practically no lasting benefit from that  It doesn't seem to be a place where one can create significant friendships  It can at best temporarily alleviate loneliness in an addictive way   As an FA  I do see some value in it  as long as I don't get too pointlessly invested and addicted Gym  meet new people  set yourself goals and when you achieve them  e g deadlift or benchpress a certain amount  you'll have more pride  Follow certain sub reddits such as r fitness  get involved  Inbetweeners is so good  It's like a teen Peep Show why not just watch cuckold porn  I know you have a girlfriend and all  but if you're into that shit  that's what porn is for It's tough man  success is never easy  Well either way good luck and wish the best for you man     PS lol don't blame you for thinking I was a dick You're pretty tall and good looking from what I can see  but I must have replied to you a dozen times over the last 2 years from my various accounts  You've never written back   I don't understand why you copy and paste these threads over and over  only to never check the replies Thank you  I'm dyslexic so it's hard for me to speak what I really mean out loud because my brain runs 50 miles a minute and I stumble over phrases and words but when I can type or write at a slower pace it's much easier to get my thoughts in order  even if I misspell things or use improper grammar  Sometimes that doesn't really work but I try to make my thoughts as clear as I can so I can understand myself too  It's pretty cathartic when writing is the only way you can truly get your thoughts out clearly  All the girls I was interested in  roughly 14 so far I guess  were girls like this  But none of them have romantical interest in me   My mother reacts like a toddler  She throws tantrums when she doesn't get her way  Sometimes her words get through to me and hurt me  but I'm slowly learning to accept that what she says reflects more on her than on me  I now recognise that she is emotionally abusive and try to keep my distance from her  I cannot change her  but I can respond to her storms with calm  It's a difficult choice  but the right one  because buying into her arguments validates her childish behaviour  Even mild ocean waves can knock a wader off their feet and makes floating not easy to do  without a tube or floaty of some kind   so it's not a calm experience like in a swimming pool   Plus  the salt in the ocean water will make you dearly regret opening your mouth    On the flip side  the ocean and beach can be really pretty  especially seeing the little sea creatures in the waves     Freshwater rivers and lakes tend to be opaque  which can freak some people out    Yeah  maybe sobecause it's nearly impossible for a woman to be single throughout all or most of their 20's  because women don't have to be the initiatorsHi   I was in a really bad place myself a few years ago  I reached out to friends who tried to help me themselves but one thing became very clear  it did not work  The only time I actually saw improvement in my mental health was when I was sent to an outpatient therapy program at a hospital near me  I know it must be tough as you don't want to lose the friendship  but you should tell someone  I'm not sure how old you are  but maybe parents  a close relative  anyone who can "take control" of the situation and really help get him the help he needs  One thing should be stressed  you cannot take someone else's life in your own hands  and that is what you are doing by listening to him and maybe giving advice  but not helping him get outside care  My friends neglected to tell someone about my situation because they thought that "I might end up hating them" "Never talking to them again" etc  but the fact of the matter is that I almost ended up dead  Don't put this kind of pressure on yourself or your friend  He needs outside help  and you should do everything in your power to get that help to him  I hope this is helpful  given that I don't know everything about the situation  Good luckThese posts are so dumb   Humans are wired to need social and romantic connection   If you are FA and completely undesirable and cannot get a partner and have likely never had one thats going to be hard to deal with mentally for anyone     This post might apply to some normies who freak out when they are single for a couple months but this kind of stuff doesn't belong here   Its one thing to be single for a little while  its another thing to be single forever       I've been getting really into meditation and buddhist teachings and I think it may be possible to feel at ease and complete regardless of your circumstances through years and years of intensive practice but I'm pretty sure thats not what this dumb facebook repost shit is getting at   Ya definitely  You'll then for sure figure out of it is idolization or exclusive preference  Glad it helped a bit man  Happy new years  And that's what you need to assess  Look to the future maybe put some money aside  travel and you will have some money back home to start you careerI get the same thing from my friends family  Here's the way i see it  some people find love at 16 in high school and grow old together  Some people meet a significant other at work  they settle down  grow apart  go through a messy divorce and then find love again in their 50s  Some people think they'll never settle down and then meet someone who changes everything  Other people never find that person and instead invest in good friends and family   The truth of the matter is that none of us have any idea what's in store for us and that  in my opinion  is what makes each 365 day trip around the Sun worthwhile    Although we like to tell ourselves otherwise  finding a partner in crime is something we have very little control over  As long as  1  you're doing everything you can to make yourself happy   learning new things  visiting new places  eating good food  challenging your body   whatever it takes  and  2  you're making some effort to meet new people  then you can be safe in the knowledge that you're doing everything you can to get your "happily every after"  In the meantime  just enjoy the ride He likes you and has a little anxiety  You pulled    Without even knowing I guess I am really curious what is she going to say  so please keep us updated   I specifically wanna know what she says when you tell her that you did what she asked and now you think it would be fair if she does what you ask    On the other hand  in Romania and I am pretty sure that in most of Europe  most of the men are uncut   That might be right about STDs  but I read somewhere that those numbers in statistics are used wrongly and the risks are not that great   I mean  I don't think it matters if I am cut or uncut when I fuck without a condom someone who has HIV  Right You didn't do anything wrong  she tested you by putting you in this shitty situation and you failed to her test  This is the period of the year when women need a boyfriend for the family  Thanksgiving  nye  chirstmas    When she saw her ex sex partner she felt excited and tested you to see if you could make a good partner for after valentine's day     Women do crazy stuffs like this all the time and rationalize it by crazy reasons    This isn't to alarm you but to chill you  this shitty stuff happens all the time  now you are warned  Just act cool  stop apologizing or looking unconfident and she could be attracted to you in a few weeks  Are you trolling  That's a lot of matches it's a figure of speech  what i meant by that is that verbal and argumentative skills are skills just like any other  you learn  grow  by challenging yourself beyond the limits of what you're already capable of  and in that way  it's like a muscle  too Very cool  man  Sounds like you're talking about meditating and mindfulness Absolutely   If you ever need someone to talk to or need any advice  don't be afraid to message me    I'm glad you wrote back  50 in 70  Have you ever heard the term  "beer goggles " That's when a person goes into a bar and everybody looks rather ordinary  The men seem okay  the women look okay  but nobody stands out to you  Then you have a beer  And another  and maybe a third  Suddenly  as the hour passes  the women all look prettier  and the men seemed more accomplished  Heck  even the guy at the billiards table is cleaning up  You have another  OMG  Look at the woman who just walked in  She's GORGEOUS  You feel all flustered and think  "I'll bet she wouldn't want to talk to the likes of me " And then she walks right up to you and says  "Hey  50 on 70    I heard you were lonesome  Want to sit in my car and have another beer " Of course  you do  Next thing you know  the windows are steamed up and her angry husband is beating on the window    That's pretty much what happened to you and Amy  Only you weren't wearing beer goggles  you were wearing GRIEF goggles  I don't know what her agenda was  but it had nothing to do with you    How could I not talk to "a person like you " A person like you who risked everything to save a baby  And now you're separated from your family  which in the long run  might be the best thing that ever happened to you    I was once like you  My mother and sisters meant everything to me  I discovered after my mother literally didn't care that her boyfriend left me to die  unconscious on the road in bitter cold temperatures  that my love was misplaced  The same with my sisters  BUT  over the years  I have cobbled together a real family of friends who never would leave me to die    This is an awful lot to think of  and I know how much pain you are in  but please cross suicide off your bucket list  There are so many people in this world who could do with a friend such as yourself  You are a good person  a fine young man  Everyone makes a mistake  especially when they're blinded by whatever goggles they happen to be wearing at the moment    That guy is a stud compared to me I have two fulltime jobs  I work 77 hours a week with no days off except for holidays so it might workThere's a book  called "Fuck Your Feelings"  Read it  Video version for maximum feels   https   www youtube com watch v MkOeb QP0LI  I absolutely agree  I have always thought the idea of needing someone to "complete" you was silly  I am a complete person  I would love to be in a happy  fulfilling relationship  but even then  I think it's nonsensical to expect someone  no matter how wonderful  to come along and "complete" you If I was  socially  valuable  surely someone would've seen that by now and considered me worth dating   A nickel on the sidewalk wouldn't go over 20 years without being picked up   Cops in Canada make 80 100k a year  19 years for 46 thousand sounds terrible tbh InterestingBeing open is key   But I have to comment that I am extremely impressed and proud that you have had those conversations with your husband   That you were able to tell him what you may need at different points and that you both remember it   That is impressive and shows just how strong you are     I have an incredibly hard time articulating what I need  because for so long I have lived my life for others and not myself   Not only did I see asking for my needs as selfish  I also found it nearly impossible   I just recently started to make myself a priority  with the help of my incredible ldr so   At the same time I am hitting a really rough patch of depression and new hormone changes to top it off   You have inspired me to try harder to articulate better   You are an amazing woman and mother   Getting the help you need is only bettering yourself  which is never weak   I think of it like going to school  you are learning and doing all you can to be the best you can be   Going to professionals for our emotional problems is just that  learning more about ourselves and our illnesses  learning how to approach our hurdles   Researching what we need to do or what we can take to help   That is something to be proud of     Many hugs for you on your journey   Maybe I do  I don't know  I don't what I'm missing out on because I've never had friends  All I do know is that I'm miserable and not having friends is one source of it  I can't will myself not to care about these things Basically the girl would keep leading me on tease me so when we finally got around to it  it was a hatefuck with no intimacyI loved Rammstein as a kid  Couldn't understand shit and still can't  don't speak German  Can I have a third option  I'd rather not be born  Hi  First off  I'm really sorry about the lack of a support system you have  It is clear from your post that you really want  and need  help  and although your parents may not be able to provide it  I would recommend taking advantage of the counselor at your school  Although he or she cannot treat you or give you therapy  if you explain the full situation  they may be able to help you find a solution  There may be some therapy programs with low or waived fees  Group therapy is usually cheaper than personal therapy  and one or two hours a week is a start   I'm not sure how you feel about lying to your parents  if that's what would need to happen  but maybe these few hours that you leave the house could be attributed to a church group   Your father seems like he would be supportive of you  Is going to him again an option  Maybe explain to him that you really believe you need help and that your mother does not understand the gravity of the situation  The last thing that I will say is that if you go to the school counselor and say you're thinking of killing yourself  they will have to require you to take a psychiatric exam at a nearby clinic Dude 77 hours a week  WTF do you do  And why How old are you and where do you live Well for starters you look like a male model  Have you tried other dating sites  Like OKCupid  Tinder has always crossed me as a sleazy place Thank you I hope you find your strength as well   Perhaps  But everyone has time for pussy  Small business owners who are never really off and are always working are married with kids  No  it wouldn't make much of a difference  Always use a condom Wow I had no idea  To me it shouldn't matter as long as they have a key and are given the lock and keys from the door originally who cares  lol this is very funny and sad at the same timeIf you are absolutely sure they are cooking the production books you should notify the CEO   However  be prepared to have to leave the company for any number of reasons   If you blow the whistle on the bad guys they won't be very happy   If you are wrong and it gets dicey they they will not be very happy for that reason   The only person you will be making happy is the CEO and the shareholders  but for that "good energy" to gain traction it may take a while and in the mean time you are in limbo   So  tread carefully   The correct thing to do is let the CEO know    not HR   this type of problem is a lot deeper than HR can handle   Good luck I was at a murder mystery with my family and I was dressed as a super hero  My love life was somehow placed under the microscope when someone asked if I was still single    By the end of it everyone was saying my character should be Captain Friendzone   Fun times I have  this too  Made major  progress on it in recent months  but a total disaster backside last night  so I'm on your spot now    No idea if it was just one bad night  or something that will take time to rebuild from  Either way   what worked for me was approaching every day with a mindset that I wanted to make and build personal connection with anyone there is an opportunity to do that with  Often it was short exchanges  but the way out of this in my case was to break that social anxiety mental block in a 'Death by 1000 papercuts' way  chipping away a little here  a little there  trying to create a pattern and routine of the right mindset and right action     EDIT  oh  in my case  I also have a problem hearing in a certain frequency that happens to be the din of party chatter  that it's hard to pick out enough consecutive sounds from a person to understand them  In those cases  I just agree and smile and try to mirror their emotion as they're talking  This is the age where people make life long friends and due to work I don't think that'll be possible  If I continue like this then in several years time when I get married I won't even have a best man let alone any guests to invite to the wedding  That's a situation that scares me  If I'm having relationship problems I literally have no one to talk to about it  No one to talk to about anything really  But if I go into college next year I feel like because I've been in a professional environment for so long my social skills won't be great and I'll come across as boring  At a true crossroads here I pay for 7  usually get 3 ish  My ping is usually 60 but I want to connect to my american friends that i left  So i dont know if there is a way to lower the ping so i can play with them Ok  I think I'm risking a downvote brigade here  but I hope this helps   First of all  it sounds like the situation really sucks for you  and I'm sorry you went through it  No one should have treated you that way   Something that jumps out at me is your total lack of responsibility taking  You acknowledge at the start of your post that some people might ask you why you didn't leave  and you handwaved it with some bullshit about money  I know it's bullshit  and I think you do too    Hear me out here   PTSD is highest in people who have an "external locus of control"  google that if you're not familiar  and see  here for one study supporting my claim  https   www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles PMC3917873     That's because if you may be attacked at any time by an abuser that you can't stop  it's terrifying and stressful  So if something bad happens to you   and   you have an external locus of control  then you   know   the bad thing might happen  and it feels as if you can't stop it from happening or do anything about it if it does happen   The bad news is  sometimes abusive people will try to abuse you   The good news is    it's not true that you can't stop it  You are in control of your own life     Money isn't the reason you stayed with a shitty room mate for 8 years  You made that choice over and over  and you could have made a different choice  I understand that there were factors that made it easier to stay or whatever  but that doesn't change the fact that you could have  at basically any time  chosen to leave  Millions of people have had shitty room mates and no money and still managed to leave  If they can figure it out  you can figure it out  And in fact    you did figure it out    you left  you blocked her  Good for you  You could have done it 7 years ago too   I predict that if you  develop a more internal locus of control  https   www verywell com cope with stress and become more resilient 3144889   you will feel much better  stop having anything like PTSD  and you will live a better  happier life   Good luck I agree with this   I don't know why I would want to feel bad about a livestyle that i'm going to have to live with anyways  If i'm going to be FA you better bet that i'm going to make the best of it  even if the rest of society considers me a loser   Though I honestly only this year just found out getting kissed on new years eve was a thing people feel the need to do Usually you get thanked  Tell them  There's no reason not to  They can't really do anything negative to you anyways That is very good advice but the only problem is that other people do know  He has had discussions with his family about this multiple time and they are fully aware of the scale of the situation yet that never really changed anything  He is a senior in highschool and the highschool counselors and several teachers are also aware of the situation  Despite the fact that all of his friends  family  girlfriend  and school counselors know about his depression and suicidal tendencies no one seems to really do much in the way of taking control and helping guide him towards professional help  I know I can't take someone else's life in my own hands but I feel like I have no other option  Despite that  what you said was very helpful though  thank you so much for taking the time to respond to my post  I appreciate it more than you know fuck my ass  whale thanks anyways man fuck my ass  thanks anyway man It's not that I do things not productive while at work  for example facebook  instagram and these things  my SO gets mad at me sometimes for not replying her for a couple of hours They probably had the time before they got super busy  I would have the time to have fuck  30min 1hr a day  but not to meet new people go out on dates  Plus setting up a date that will work with both of our schedules might be a challenge  I understand how you feel  Pretty sure the vast majority of this sub does  Loneliness can definitely be debilitating  Have you tried to rely on your family members at all  I'm sure they'd help    You may be placing too much emphasis on having a SO  It won't solve all of your loneliness issues  Last year I moved away from my misses and felt pretty isolated until I figured out how to be alone without being lonely  I wish you the best of luck  things will get better  talk to a lawyer   In US  you should have had uninsured underinsured motorist coverage  in the UK  you should be able to get an insurance company appointed that will act as if he was insured  and they do the hard work of going after him Somebody put this on Reddit one day  Please forgive me for not crediting it to the person  but there's some good stuff in here that I've passed on to friends in your situation                     What Ive learned from Being Unemployed for 25 months Despite having more skills than ever in my life  Ive learned employers seem to want a younger worker  I learned   That my body has past injuries that prevent me from doing heavy physical labor that I once did so easily  But I dont have to give in to pain and soreness every time and I can push past it   I really need to scare myself at least once a week by doing something outside my comfort zone  Trying something new or unusual  however small or large makes me feel good   I should use my mind more  my body less and patience is useful  That being unemployed is corrosive to the soul and mind and NOT to give in to negative thinking   My sweet  sweet wife is a bed rock in my life that I never imagined when I married her  She continues to give unconditional love despite my aimless direction  And Im humbled by it and with her  with each passing day   Following my interests when I was younger  allowed me a full  interesting and fruitful life  But now I cant seem to recreate it again   To reach out to people for help that I need support  ideas  and their thoughts  and interest  But as much as I need people  I need to follow my hunches  and feelings too and in other wordsI need both worlds   I need something to look forward to each day  however small or trivial  Ive learned I can be happy with a good book  a hot meal  laughing with friends  seeing my wifes car in the garage  or my kitty arch her back to me with a look of loving trust on her face   Laughter brightens gloomy thoughts  a gray day and it gives me a burst of optimism that lasts for hours   That on those days when a smile feels like it might crack my face  these are precisely the days I need to do it the most   My kittiesChristy and Pepper  need to be around me  resting against me  and touching me constantly  And when theyre not around me  its because they sleep more than any animal I know   Volunteering in the community and helping others helps me  It elevates and encourages me  almost as much as it helps them   I discovered friends were frequently people I dont even know  Like Ken  Nick and Bill who helped and encouraged me for no other reason than they cared about me as another human being   People remember me from teaching stints and it always impresses me how far reaching and long lasting that is   I learned again  the only constant in life is change and I have to roll with it  learn from it  embrace it  and ultimately  accept it   I dont need as much money as I thought I did   Ive learned the Federal government and our state have a heart  and by extending my UE benefits to me  they do know and they do care   At times when I think people are insensitive  cold and un feeling  someone will  for no reason at allshow me that Im dead wrong  Like the nice guy who asked me if I was waiting for the parking spot  then with a smile drove on to look further  I also learned that   Sometimes I worry for no reason at all that I obsess about stupid things and in general  find things to feel bad about   I have tons and tons of skills and that most things that I doI do them very well   That going through old email  and contacting prospective employers from months back  was very smart  And when I got the interview  showing up 5 minutes early  instead of just on time was very smart   My creative solution to get hired even impressed a hardened  experienced recruiter  And now that I have a job  I learned that unemployment passes  Really  If you read this far  and youre unemployed  keep looking and applying and dont lose the faith  Believe it will get better and imagine the job you want  And visualize you getting it  Every day  believe it possible and say  today is the day  C  Russel  It makes you feel like you're not on the same level as the other people in the group or that you don't belong as well   Yes  exactly  Since it might also be with a person you already are friends with and feel comfortable around one on one with  it makes you feel like in the grand scheme of their world  you mean very little to them "if there are better people around"I used to write down on a book the things I had to do  but I noticed that spent quite some time writing things and thinking on what I should write  time that I could use reviewing processes or making meetings    I know this is a habit I should keep  but it can't take away too much time   And  about deadlines  most of the times the engagements are either too short or the client's don't collaborate with the auditing  like  I try to schedule meetings or ask for some documents and they don't deliver in time  When I speak to the manager about it  the answer is     You're not asking correctly     You should learn how to solve your problems     Stay next to them until they give you what you need   I even asked a couple of managers this last week what's the importance of an financial audit to the client  because this last client wasn't giving a fuck to what was going on I'm looking at it with a glass half full approach  There are a lot of people alone or in bad relationships who struggle in other aspects of life  Other than being FA I have a pretty good easy life where I don't have stress and get to do cool shit  FWIW I'm not talking about material possessions since I'm rather minimalist but mostly travel  experiences  etc  I've simply dedicated all my life force into things I'm good at rather than futile attempts at things I'm not good at  It's basic StrengthFinder math    talent X effort   success  Focus your efforts on stuff you're good at  People who suck at dating aren't going to yield a high return by spending so much effort in areas they lack natural talent  You're better off focusing on making yourself a better person in areas you have talent  and just let everything else fall as it may  Acceptance of possibly being alone but making the best out of the rest of life is the key to FA happiness Sadness hits first  but quickly turns to rage instead  Where's my bottle   Just freaking ask  Literally it's not a huge deal  Try to go someplace for the first hangout  maybe grab coffee or ice cream  Just be yourself  don't worry about being a "nice guy"  that's a BS excuse that you tell yourself to psych yourself out   I believe in you  you got this  Just take a shot brother Im not either  whats tldr I've never been able to make friends so I relate to this all  particularly the part about it getting harder as you get older  I've observed that people are less kind and treat each other more like strangers when they get older  They lose their humor and become unfeeling assholes to anyone who isn't friends or family    https   np reddit com r adulthate comments 5hqrvm why are adults such effin shitty assholes    After I returned home I quickly contacted his insurance  Turns out the car he hit me with had no insurance so there is nothing they can do for me       If he had no insurance who were you calling and how did you obtain this information      If you went to the emergency room were the police also involved  Do you have this guy's address  Your only option to get him to pay is to sue him for the cost of repairs or replacement  whichever is cheaper  Man  I'm sorry  1  Work on your self confidence  You don't think you're good enough  which is a blatant incorrect statement considering you're married to her  2  Stop doing it  You're causing yourself major pain that you could have stopped  Stop  Hurting  Yourself  For HER pleasure  That's all sorts of fucked up  3  Clean ALL the spots  You're taking responsibility in letting your dogs lick that stuff  Do NOT let her take control of doing that to your dogs  That is selfish of both of you  regardless of how cowardly you are in the relationship  4  Honestly  you view looks as the most important thing  and that's just seriously not all there is to a relationship  She's broken  like really broken  and she's breaking you as well  Like you gotta stand up for yourself  There is NO other way around this  You will not be able to do anything else unless you confront her  I mean  you can run away and take the dogs and peace out  but I feel like you want to make it work  Just realize that it's not a relationship to save if she's using the relationship to get her way  Does it even matter if she doesn't love you  so long as she's labeled as your wife  You're in a twisted relationship and she needs help  If you can't get her to see that  and she's hurting you  then it's time to move on  There are plenty of hot women you will be able to get  Yes  it is totally possible  And there are hot women who won't treat you like a sex object like she is gaming arcade    LARP    Paintball    Locked Room puzzles I think that that's a solid idea  I'll keep checking out jobs and apartments out of necessity  but at the same time it's a good idea to keep looking at that too  just to see if there's a constructive resolution    Either way  I'm probably going to limit my contact with him  My only concern is that he's going to get aggressive with my mum when he's finished yelling at me I hate having too much free time  and working long hours makes me forget that im single as fuck Yikes  Sometimes we get into a hole and it is okay to feel the way you are feeling  Somedays you will be better with this  other days worse  Focus on the people you are comfortable talking with  love you or understand your having trouble   Also I suggest looking into journalling  this should help get out your thoughts without having to speak out loud  There are a few different ways you can do this  just research which sounds best for you She's sounds crazy  RUUUUNNN FOREST RUUUUNNN The reason I use tinder is because you don't have to write that much about yourself  I don't have an education and never had a job in my life  I'm currently attending a program that helps people with mental illness find a job  That's nothing I want to put in my profile description  Be prepared that the pug will love your fiancé more than you  But you will be good enough until they get home  Pug life is brutal Maybe he's using a different app  The app I'm using hides the sidebar I'm so sorry for your loss   Same  but sorry you feel that way it's not a good feeling  i would just go for it man    life is too short to contemplate everything you said you have good chemistry and she sounds awesome so yh i understand you dont wanna ruin the work relationship but hey nothing ventured nothing gained  think of the great prehaps I think you're on the right track wanting to see a counselor  Some people are just wired to be high stress  and it sounds like you may be one of us  Believe me  I could be a professional mattress tester and I would find a way to overstress about it  The key is balance  You need a hobby that is stress relieving  and you need to place limits on your time that you're available to other people  Don't even worry about keeping up a lifestyle  if you're traveling that much  you don't have time for that  Get a small comfortable apartment with an honest cleaning lady  Use a car service or uber  you don't need to waste time on upkeep and maintenance  on a car that you drive less than a third of the time  Simplicity helps a lot  the less you have to worry about  the better  Yea you're lucky there  How did it not turn into to a felony   I've definitely had my fair share of experiences where cops didn't know how much weed I had and thankfully they always guessed under an ounce I had a similar situation but  it was for mania   I talked to my pDoc and he told me to consult with my school ombudsman 'emotional inteligence'  equally as important in any social situation  Its one thing knowing how to express yourself and knowing how to get your point across but picking up on social cues  body language etc will help with connecting with people by simply knowing when to speak  when to observe and when to 'understand' You've finally adapted to your lifestyle  It's like listening to a great song and once you listen to it the 15th time  it's lost its flavor  Do you have other ideas you want to pursue instead Wow   Absolutely tell everyone youre active with Drop her  man  She sounds insecure and  frankly  you do as well  and there's nothing wrong with that at 15    because who isn't     but it's not worth all the hurting  The mature move would be to distance yourself  And after a certain point  if you don't and you keep throwing yourself into this cycle  it's on you  Do something about it while you can I was raised in a miIitary household and I relate to this so strongly  We moved every 2 3 years though  So not quite as often  I try to explain it to even my parents but they can't relate   If you want to talk to someone going through the same thing  feel free to message me  I'd love to chat     Probably not arrested  but talked to  for sureTimeSounds like you need some new friends  Go where you're celebrated  not where you're tolerated me and my wife got married in UK  before moving to US  but only did that to make visa application easier   As she is already here  you can get married  and apply for a  greencard  https   www uscis gov green card green card through family green card immediate relative us citizen inside   which will make it easier to do other things than just school  You may have to get sponsorship from family if your income is not enough   As you will be married  it puts her on a fast track to become a citizen  in only  3 years  https   www uscis gov us citizenship citizenship through naturalization naturalization spouses us citizens    I would recommend she gets citizenship as soon as possible  simply because it makes life so much easier You are sexually inexperienced  The ideal partner has respect for your boundaries and if your guy knows the swinging thing is a no no for you  yet is still pushing it  you two are not compatible "I got reassurance for consent"  Based on what you've written here  I think it's ok   You didn't have sex with her  and you seem genuinely concerned    which tells me you were fairly respectful   If you're worried it was inappropriate because of sobriety  or that she is uncomfortable       Try talking about it and tell her you're concerned and ask her how she feels about what happened   Fucking tell him I know how you feel  I'm divorced because I couldn't have kids and he wanted them  I have a chronic illness so it's very hard for me to work full time but I'm not sick enough to get SSI  which isn't a living wage anyway  And www reddit com r RandomKindness  is where you want to hang out   hugsIt may not be related to the psychotic features  but it may be related to your mental health  Which  correct me if I'm wrong  you seem to be concerned about  You guys sound like a good candidate for marriage counseling  The key that counseling reinforces is communication  I owe my relatively smooth marriage to the communication my wife and I have  Counseling could show you how to communicate in a neutral way and through mediator that could calm things down should they get too hot   Hang in there Some people here have never even  had  friends  much less have them currently as someone who was also experiencing shit I can sum up my advice with life gets better    all you need is the right mindset you sound really confused but just remember you never lose until you give up  in a few years your gonna look back at this post and laugh due to how much change has occured Yes  that's one of the best options  didn't think of it at the moment   Rammstein lyrics often lose their "magic" when they are translated  Another good one is "Schwarzes Glas"  only exists as a demo  apparently producer didn't want it on an album  which is about ugliness and how ugly people are often blamed for things they never did with lines like "guilty  because we are ugly"  but sadly I'm not very good at translating the impact of songs No one ever answers me though  What  is  the fucking point  Some people here don't get asked those questions because it's so obvious that they're saddled with intractable problems and thus are completely hopeless  Count your blessings That may just be the bust of confidence I needed  I'm glad that you realize that you have things you want to change in your life and are trying to find solutions  To me that is already a huge step  My suggestion is to make  kind of like your post  a list of things you'd like to change but with small tasks to accomplish it   For example if your goad is to be independent then set goals such as     Searching for jobs in the area   Start saving some money  for example in buying less food and making it more therefore fulfilling the task of learning how to cook    Go to driving lessons  find a spot in the week when you can go and once you've finished lessons maybe you can get a vehicle by saving some money    Learn how to do stuff around the house  you can go to the internet and have several how to videos and such   This will take some time and a lot of effort but if you apply to it I'm sir you'll manage   It seems that you are struggling with depression and that's a hard problem to deal with  I think that's something that is better taken care of with someone who knows what he's  she's doing such as a doctor  There's also many alternative therapies   you can search and pick one   Hope this helps    Same here  Mid thirtysomething and it is not getting easier as time goes by     I feel like I missed out on so much  Never had the experience of teenage love so I feel in many ways my growth has been stunted Post Partum depression is a real thing and those of us who already have mental health challenges are significantly more likely to suffer from it  You are describing classic signs of this and there is   nothing wrong with you for being overwhelmed and having these feelings   seriously  Everyone needs help  everyone needs support  and sometimes this comes in the form of a therapist and medication  You are absolutely making the correct decision to reach out for help and acknowledging that there is an issue is a HUGE step    You are so much stronger than you know right now and I know you can do this       Good luck and tons of  HUGS  and positive vibes  Haha sorry I didn't mean it to come off that way  I have friends  thank God  but some people don't even have that luxury Thank you so much Some people here are so repulsive for a variety of reasons that they never hear things like this Thank you I really appreciate the encouragement and uplifting vibes Hm    Have you considered visiting a counsellor or a therapist  Post to  r sex exactly what you said here  I guarantee that they'll have an answer for you  pI needed to hear this  Thank you  Honestly I know I'm stupid and need to stop because it'll only end in hurt but I started to think that it didn't matter because I loved her  I will make the effort to try and break off from it as best as I canDude these sound fun as shit  If people follow you and are sheep you can turn this around by stopping the retarded sheep from bullying him  Seriously though  he might have depression or something so it'd be good to have a talk to him then he'll know someone has actually noticed him You're young  You still have time to grow  to flourish  or to relax  Save as much as you can so that when you decide to  you can live comfortably  Meanwhile  a lot of this advice is great  You have wiggle room  remember that it WON'T be the end of the world if something goes wrong This might not get the best results   Watching cuckold or reading cuckold stories will satisfy the fantasies  This calms you down and makes the fantasy go away for a bit  But it will return  Keep doing this and it will become more embedded in you  It'll become a habit  While this is might be preferable to the current situation  I think it's better to go the other way   I'd advise going to a therapist and working on the root of those fantasies  Maybe it can be helped   You could compare this distinction with working on anger issues  One  you could buy a punching bag and hit it while screaming every day  Or two  you could work with a therapist to find and hopefully remove the cause of all the anger   Anger issues and probably cuckold fantasies are not watermarked into your personality  I believe they can be altered  though incredibly easier said than done Anything the pet do  your liable  That's the problem with having pets Pigeons  well mainly their poop  can give you some pretty nasty diseases like cryptococcal meningitis   I'd you are going to keep it make sure to not inhale ingest any of its droppings Have you considered joining the military  You may not think it's for you but it would definitely give you a purpose and kickstart to your life  Also  if you already have a certain amount of college credits you can join at higher rank just for that   although the amount of credit needed varies from branch to branch it's usually not that many   It may not be something you've ever thought about doing  but I would encourage you to at least do a little research to get a realistic picture the military  Understand that most people in the military are dedicated to things outside combat and will never even fire a weapon outside of basic training especially in the Navy and Air Force  And despite what people say the pay is actually pretty decent when you consider that you basically get free housing and food  etc  I think the starting monthly pay is  1449 00 a month  but you would be making more with college credits    It might or might not interest you but like I said  I think you would benefit from doing a little research to make sure you're not missing out on an opportunity for you    Whatever you decide I hope you find the right direction for your life and have a great 2017 and beyond I would say since you're so indecisive don't go to college right out of high school  If you can travel the country do that  Just go and experience shit  In this moment that is honestly what I think you need to do    I joined the army back in 2002 and got out in 2010  I seen a lot and I understand your brain to a degree  You just have to get out there and experience what you can  After that you will go to school or whatever  what do you mean My teenage daughter "Dad  I'm gay"   Me  "OK  Dinner's ready"    As a parent  my only concern is for how she might be discriminated against by the assholes of the world  I hope your family and friends come to the same place OP  I have BP2   AD also  It took me 10 years to crawl out of darkness  I'm sad right now  r ship breakup  and I'm doing  all  I can to stop depression creeping up  It  is  a hard fight but your admittance is your willingness for change   You  can  do this  Trust is hard    but you have to   Hmmm this is a tuffy   It depends on the type of company that you work for  I'm sure that if you were to fail the test and they're a professional establishment then they will have some sort of employee confidentiality rule  at the end of the day  you  work for them and your job has nothing to do with your parents  Being under the age of 18 however could mean that your employer may take things to a personal level and tell your parents but that's just pure speculation  Also don't just up and leave over an "if"  You never know  you may pass and be in the clear but now you have no job   Yes  you are a bit of an idiot so don't smoke at all if you're going to be working within the next couple days  I guess  I don't really know how long it takes to get out of your system     In terms of a record  I doubt they'd take it to the police or anything like that as it really is an internal matter  Also if you were high on the job or whatever  which it sounds like you weren't  then it should be alright   The primary reason to do this drug test the day after NYE is precisely to catch employees such as yourself so it's unfortunate that your workplace conducts those for your sake     If they kept you on  even if the test came back positive  then yes it may be on some sort of record and you may receive disciplinary action but atleast you still have a job  As I say I doubt this would be passed onto the cops so it shouldn't affect future career asepcts or college or whatever Life How do i get to where u are lol  That sounds awesome   Edit  didn't finish reading the second half  That's what a lot of people want  Life isn't that deep  There's not much meaning to it you have to put the meaning there yourself whatever that may be  It sounds very much like an internal thing   Sure  he may have shut you down a little there but thats kind of a choice you have there in that moment to take it personally  dwell on it for the rest of the night and make an issue out of it   OR you could just laugh it off and turn it back on him in a joking manner   people have opinions  and we all exaggerate so theres no point in taking harm from it at all  just see it for what it is  you probably do it all the time without realising it   When you give attention to the negative aspects like that  you literally push yourself out of the conversation bc your state of mind has just shifted from an in the moment  engaged type to a reflective  analysis which probably went over every one else's head   If it really is a concern to you and keeps happening then maybe broach the topic with him when you are alone in a respectful way by letting him know it bothered you and you weren't sure how to feel about it   Jealousy can be a very bad thing  we all feel it   but those of us who can crush it in its tracks and move on quite rapidly are always better off   People are very receptive on a subconscious level and we don't realise but by thinking about the negative of a situation will literally change our body language to be less approachable by others   Be confident in what you have to say and if no one listens or reacts  who cares   Try again with equal enthusiasm and sooner or later people will pick up on your eagerrness to join in the discussion   Also  if we want others to respect our opinion we must first respect theirs  you might 'love' the show and It sounds like he's ok with that  but are you ok with him only barely enjoying the show    all the besti meant the no one ever answers me bit You could leave an anonymous note explaining your situationWhat's the point in life Thank you for the encouragement and sympathies  I want you to know that we can take control  it will be different for each of us and it will be extremely difficult but we can make it through and kick mental illness in the ass  I hope you find the strength and encouragement you need for your fight  As a swimmer    If you are going to learn  Learn at a pool  Pools are safe zones and with 0 currents  allows for you to practise techniques like keeping your head up and in water survival movements   Rivers are rough stuff  I would not do it  With raging waters and currents  1 bad sweep and you might cut yourself on rocks or smash yourself onto rocks  Never swim in rivers   For lakes and oceans  It varies from calm water to crazy ass waves  In these situations  the best you can do is keep your head above water and swim towards and coast  If not  Just float and curl for warmth   The shock of the cold might kick him  This is usually the hard part of ocean and lakes All excellent advice  See a counselor too for yourself  Use the money you spent on your abuser boyfriend and pay a counselor or therapist if insurance doesn't cover any of it  Best of luck Telling someone is definitely the right thing to do  It makes it out that the taddle tale is the bad one  but in this situation it's a very reasonable action to carry out  This  doubled with the fact that a popular and well known student is on his side  would definitely make that kids situation a lot easier Well that's a good thing  God job  First of all  the Red Pill subreddit is the bottom of the bottom  don't even look at it because it's pretty much all bullshit to make sad guys feel better    Second  there may be societal pressure to achieve these things within a timeframe but it's important to note that you have to do what feels right to YOU  You can still enjoy yourself after being a teen  in fact  my best years are currently happening and I'm in my late 20's  Don't let others tell you what's right when it comes to achieving your own goals  you decide that  Do what makes you happy I suppose I am concerned  I'm mostly curious as to why it's happeningI worked through the night   At midnight when they started the count down I cried  thankfully not around anyone else in the building    Life changes and loneliness can certainly make New Year's just as depressing   It's a holiday with a sole focus on partying essentially   I've been over the whole party hype for years  but it doesn't mean it doesn't effect me   This past year found me moving to a new place where I know only a little family and my co workers   Any holiday can do this to us   You aren't alone  Hugs Small thing  You mean Dickinson size  It grows with age  Don't be scared  Ducks come on all sizes  Big Dickson  small Dickson  and micro Dickson Glad I could help  And yeah  if you don't like it  you don't like it  At least it's not huge and it won't be too hard to get rid of  It could definitely be worse  Good luck  Screw staying calm  Scream and cry and let that shit outChange his sexual orientation to straight and gender of his targets from male to female and see if that makes a difference in your perception Why did you do it  What were you gaining  Were you lonely  Did you feel like you and your girl were growing apart  Were you just excited for attention and a self esteem boost  You'll do it again if you don't figure out why you did it in the first place  If you love her  you owe it to you both to get to the root of it so you stop the behavior    Ultimately its not the worst betrayal ever  but it is a betrayal of her trust in you  It can be worked through but understand it will take communication and earning back her trust  Whether you tell her or not you still have to communicate the core issue and work with her to overcome it    Oh  and don't be a shithead  Don't do it again  You have achieved so much  just remember to breathe and is there no possible to call in more people help you take some time offThere is nothing wrong with asking him to move in together so long as he agrees to it  You can't force him to move in but he can't force you to be in a relationship  Depending on how long you've been dating for and your age  there has to be goals you reach that move the relationship forward and this is one of them especially after 8 years  Try not to make it about the finances and more about wanting to progress the relationship  I assume you want to move in with him regardless  Just think about the relationship and let the finances take the back burner in your head but don't feel guilty I go fishing  It's very healing to me  so thank  you  for the encouragement too  Best wishes OP      big hugswell that's very subjective if different for everyone depending on your religion and background but everyone has a meaning for it in the words of Albert campus " the meaning of life it literally what's stopping you from killing yourself"Such a good show  The amazing thing is is that i relate to a lot of these characters so much  Even mr gilbert with his bitter and sour views on life   DI'm not a lyrics person at all  so the meaning of the song is secondary  And judging by those Lindemann band lyrics  I might be better off not translating anything lol I think if you are at a good place in your relationship and can afford to do so you should move out  26 seems more than old enough to move out unless he likes being taken care of by his mom maybe  But I think it's all about how you approach it  If he loves you I would think he would move because it would make you happy and  him in turn tooWell I might as well kill myself yep all the time The same thing I tell myself every year  This year I'll be more social  I'll talk to people  go out more  make friends  ask girls out    then I end up never knowing what to say and just going through my day then sitting at home alone  I want a real social life so bad  I just have no idea how to make it happen Now you're starting to believe your own BS  Holding together a marriage with children is constant work  Stop pretending that you would have a love life if you just worked less  You wouldn't  please dont you have a strong purpose you just dont realise it yet https   youtu be 6ipVHyKnx6Y This will pass  and one day you will be the light in someone else's life  Until then listen to the song link above and know that you're not all alone in the world  As someone in a similar situation to you I just wanted to chime in here and say that you are doing the right thing    My husband works similarly long hours  and I too am alone with our 10 month old most of the time   It's hard   Add depression anxiety into the mix and it can feel impossible   You're doing great  Your child is warm  fed  and loved  and t hat's the most important thing  Asking for help when you need it is not a sign of weakness  it is a show of your commitment to being the best you possible for your child    it probably doesn't count for much coming from a stranger on the Internet  but i am proud of you  If you ever need to talk to another mother going through what you're going through  or literally just vent  please don't hesitate to message me   Stay strong  you're wonderful  There are some truly evil sociopathic people out there  Ive been a victim too  it stays with you for life and like lizards they just keep looking for more prey  Telling your story here will be helpful to others  Thank you man  I really appreciate itSounds like she desperately needs some therapy    that's messed upNo joke  try recording yourself  Audio diaries or whatever  Just practice talking about what you want to say Thank you for the kind words  You're spot on about the red pill sub  I'll take them to heart    Then pick one city and leave out the drive part  Round trip flights are less expensive    As for the coast  eeeeehhh  It is a lot to driving and further than you think it is  The coast gets old and for the most part you are just hauling ass  It takes between a day and a half to two days to make the trio if driving direct with minimal stops  gives medal Well when will I   "When life gets better"   Because that's what I've been told  but coinecedently it never has  And you're the only person who bothered to reply to this  Just goes to show no one really gives a fuck here  This entire sub  and suicide watch  are just places we go to vent  We get given basic advice most of the time and it very rarely changes people's lives You are wonderful for caring about a total stranger and offering up an ear to hear  Thank you for your kindness and understanding  Then why the Hell was she on Tinder  Im pretty sure I'm a porn addict  I am aware of it  Hard to stop it sounds like you're just not invested enough in these people and that you yourself don't really care if you hang out or not  People pick up on these things to   Since you even considered dropping them for another social group if not for how hard it is to meet new people in your situation  Kinda shows you don't really care about them that much    If you care about them and want them to put in an equal effort  make it clear with your actions  Otherwise peoples opinion of you could very well be "well he's a nice guy but he doesn't seem to mind if we hang out or not  i won't bother"  You have to be prepared to put in more effort than everyone else  if want you want is the be a 'social butterfly'   Its a ripple effect  you have to be super consistent for a long time but sooner or later people see how carefree and giving you are  and will naturally want to be around you more   In small towns its quite easy for people to get stuck in a closed minded frame  of mind 'bubble'  which can make finding decent chat a lot harder  not impossible though   A lot of superficial 'hey how are you  good" conversations ect  You need to be able to offer more than that  excite those around you with your tales and experience  Go travelling and you will see that there are many open receptive people just dying to connect with you  Yeah  shame is about 50  of my brain now  Luckily I'm so vexed most of the time that I can shift focus off the shame I'm 26 and I live in the Northern Nevada area  You I kept trying to for 5  years and everything I tried  even though positive short term  ultimately ended with me having some kind of breakdown and I can't take anymore failureDump your boyfriend  Simple as that  You clearly want to explore and having your boyfriend isn't going to help  You are young   You will find another boyfriend later on too So sorry for your loss   My dad died on December 3rd   You're in my thoughts Mine wasn't worth writing home about at that age    There's a  lot  of variation in time frame for development   But you're in the zone    Well  the good part about 14 is that from here on  every year you get more control over your life   And dude  you've got 20 more years for romance  why waste time on wanting it now     This isn't what you want to hear  but focus on what you have for a little while   Your one friend  is he nice   It's awesome that you like lifting   You can run away  but you'd be smart to make a plan first   Where do you want to run to   What's the plan for food and shelter   It might be easier to work on changing the current things in your life than it is to run away   Is there any process to change subjects so that you're not stuck in Art Yep thats exactly what im feeling right now  I really wouldnt care if i got hit by a bus or a car or contract something in my body at least id die naturally instead of taking the easier way out im sorry you feel this way i really am but only you know yourself to the extent to know what to do next but i think the key would just be to change your perspective on everything a healthy mindset will lead you to a healthy life  i looks like you need personal advice so i would ask someone you care about such as a family member or the frined you mentioned before and have a real conversation with you where you can get this all out I mean  I could ask him for an open relationship  We did it before  but we did it wrong  I think I could do better now  I don't think he wants to  but I could change his mind  I do have really serious feelings for him  We've been dating for years I dunno why you're being down voted  The universe doesn't care about anyone  There is no god  Being deserving of something is not something that exists in nature  It's something people made up to comfort themselves Same for much of the internet  especially forums and social media  In fact  the sheer amount of poor english in media like that could have a  detrimental  effect     However  some sites are written by highly literate people  or even professional writers  and in those cases I'd say it's a hell of a lot better than the former  But I think reading professional writers is ideal  as most of them will have a greater mastery of the language  and very often the material will be more challenging as well    Aside from the linguistic element  I think reading also helps with general cognition because it forces our brains into a more active and engaged kind of thinking  For example if I'm reading a novel  I'm trying to remember everything that happened previously  and how it relates to what I'm reading now  and I likely have to maintain this narrative over a course of days or weeks  depending on the length of the book   series   And certain non fiction subjects can also challenge the mind in a variety of other ways  of course    I definitely feel mentally sharper and more articulate when I'm reading more  generally speaking   That being said  there are also quite a lot of self help books on the market ranging from how to be a better conversationalist  to thinking faster on your feet  to creative thinking  which might also address some of the issues OP mentioned   Also  as far as verbal fluidity and articulation go    WRITING   can also help  Same idea as with the reading  Even just something like journaling could help with organizing your own thoughts and presenting them to others  Could be worth trying   So sorry for your loss   sending you a    hug    I have a Pug in my apartment too  The only time he ever barks is if he hears someone knock on the door  and that's only if he feels like it  He's an older Pug  about 12 or 13  and has arthritis in his back legs  so he hardly moves at all  He also loves my kids even though they can be a little rough  An absolute great family dog   The only downside is that he sheds EVERYWHERE  It gets all over my clothes  the furniture  the floor  even in places he's never been The point is that i can convince them that i dont have the time to meet people  especially since most women are either shallow or taken  No problem mate  I was just making a joke  Cheers You just entered high school and you hate it which is quite normal  I hated everything about it  I didn't have hardly any friends and was just living day to day always dreading the next and even contemplated suicide which was reported to the school  I got some help after that but I still hated everything  I eventually dropped out of high school due to unrelated reasons  and found a job which helped me get out of my shell a lot    Dropping out of high school while it did help me mature a bit and grow out of my shell has also limited my potential jobs  My advice  try to pick up a new hobby and just try to be more outgoing and talk to people  If you put forth the effort the others around you will too  A piece of advice a friend gave me and has helped me in getting out of my shell is this  "It's only awkward if you make it awkward " Don't worry about the small things in life it all passes    "Never give up  never surrender "   Galaxy Quest  Enjoy your success but remember that every advantage you had has helped you immensely  Remember that lots of people could have succeeded in your situation but could you succeed without those advantages  Could you succeed coming from a Broken home  no food  abusive parents  etc    Maybe you could  maybe not  but remember that before you decide what you have "earned"  At some point  you need to let things go   Practice does make perfect  but 99  of the time all you need is "good enough"   You might want to look into tips for handling perfectionism  because  as you've seen  wanting everything to be perfect makes everything harder This is very normal  Talking everyday  you're going to run out of things to say  It's important to take breaks from talking to each other or seeing each other in order to do other things that you enjoy    r SuicideWatch  Seek out help  Don't let life get you down Or drink   uber lyft taxi walk bike bus Good on you for recognising and speaking to your husband that you need help  Shame he wasn't responsive  Remember that he is not a mental health professional who can assess what level of care you need with impartiality  Your husband may be concerned about practical child care arrangements  A hospital social worker may be able to assist with organising that    Some services offer mother child residential care    Consider getting a full time nanny after you are discharged    I wish you all the best I'm so sorry  My health is failing because we can't afford health insurance or the treatment I need for a couple of chronic illnesses  I completely understand where you're coming from  I have been looking for work for three years but  the only interview I've been called for was a scam  Thanks for the tip  I'll check it out  This  sure you COULD run away  but that's not going to end as well as sticking it outSad but trueNo over here in the UK you choose specific subjects to study  I chose Art as one of them because in thought I needed it but didn't  I hate my teacher because he believes I can do better but I can't  Running away seems better than what I'm stuck in right now And no I don't have a plan but that's what i kinda enjoy  I want things to be spontaneous as they come and go  I plan to travel the world when I'm old enough This is a government websiteWhat the fuck haha  This is so random  Nice of you to save this bird though  Hope everything goes well wow    This hits close to home because I can some of myself in him  I have a relationship with a friend like this that    well I can be a genuine asshole  I dont intend to but it inevitably happens  Sigh  I'm sorry I dont have anything more to add other than thank you for the sobering self realization and I'm sorry  You seem self aware and mature enough that something way better should be down the road for you  You should tell him but whether or not you say when you got it is up to you  if it won't get traced you can try to link it on him  but it's definitely a good plan to tell him it exists i could be looking into this too deep but im studying psychology and to me it looks like your psychological shadow  Jungian shadow  is developing feelings that your trying to repress  and ideally you should express these emotions  your not a bad gf your young and obviously not ready to be tied down yet nothing wrong with experimenting and learning about yourself by dating other guys   obviously dump your bf first  this may just be a sign that you like your bf but ultimate he is not the one for you  You're so young though  stick it out for a year more and see if it's all still the sameAsk your GP about it againNo matter the age of your siblings being there for them is also showing them that it is ok to grieve in whatever way is needed   If you can and want to be there for them don't forget to take time for yourself as well   Time to privately do and feel whatever it is you need   Pay attention to your needs  you can't be there for anyone else or help in the slightest if you don't   Trying too hard to choke it all down just makes it worse    I feel for you and am so very sorry   I lost both parents by the time I was 25  it sucks and is so painful   Remember we all grieve differently and it changes constantly   There is no right or wrong way  it's what you need Do you have anyone who can help you with this   My advice would be to take it a little at a time   Get a friend who knows what you like and have them help you out of your comfort zone a bite at a time   If you like chicken nuggets  try a bite of chicken without the breading   If you like bread  try sourdough bread    Or something like that    If it helps  create a reward system for yourself   10 bites of new food gets you a bottle of nail polish  or something else small that you like Do you smoke normally    Hopefully the plane itself isn't smoking You can't make vague resolutions and expect them to work out well   Like  "be more social"  What does that mean    Make an  active  resolution  like  "The week of January 1 I'm going to join a meetup group online  The second week I'm going to sign up for one event  The third week I'm going to attend said event  The fourth week I'm going to sign up for another event  The fifth week I'm going to attend the event and talk to 2 people "  And so forth  Action not talk Should be fine  but report backI did last year and nothing changed  Always told this bullshit lie  "Life gets better" when it simply doesn't for some I see  I have tons of hobbies that have stopped giving me happiness and trust me I value myself I have had many chances to ruin my life with drugs but I haven't done it because I am the only one that can protect me but I feel paranoia because all my life I've had people who have made my life hell  I feel like a caveman who needs to be constantly on guard from attacks  am I being too nice to this person  Am I being used  Am I really living or am I just waiting to die   Feelsbad   SomeFantastic1  What does that green dot mean by your name I guess making the assumption that you're gay is just the easiest to deal with       Maybe you should use it as an opening to share with her what is really making you unhappy in life  I have to say I agree  I don't want to die  but at the same time  I'm so damn tired of living  some days  When non existence is better than existence  it's perfectly logical to prefer death over life  I would undoubtedly choose the first option and although I'm not actively suicidal  I'm too big of a coward   I would not at all mind being dead so long as the manner of my death was rather quick and painless  My life is really nothing much to lose   I too used to love Rammstein as a teenager  I still listen to them from time to time  Have you heard the piano version of Mein Herz Brennt  It's great Dude  you're fine  We have a friend that we've known since kindergarten  I'm 31 now  that mingled with all the different groups  If you said "Do you know John Jones " people would say yes  He was able to move from one group to another and be confident every time  He was friends with the jocks  nerds  geeks  different races  and then our small group of friends     It's not bad to be the guy on the outside defintely taking this one to heart thank youPlease don't  Message me and we can talk  I have felt the same way before and am so happy I didn't go through with it  Sorry for both of your losses  My dad died December 10th  Thinking of both of you I call it pet glitter  I love my sons little mooch but she releases the love excessively  They are comfortable with roombas I have heard but we keep lint rollers in the car so we look presentable in public I dont really know why doctors won't send you to get herbal medications when some of them are just as effective with less side effects   Like  anything you can take has complications and potential interactions   I guess an issue with herbals is the various extracts  But then again thats also a problem with generics   Ashwagandha is probably the best thing for you   https   examine com supplements ashwagandha   KSM 66 or sensoril are the standard extracts  most widely known to be effective  Potential side effects are minor and rare  The studies are done with the extracts  so if you don't get ksm66 or sensoril there isn't any hard evidence to back it up  However  even the whole root products like  this one  https   www amazon com ORGANIC INDIA Ashwagandha Supplement Capsules dp B003PGE98K ref sr 1 5 s it s hpc ie

some introspection   I recommend keeping a journal of some sort and writing down when things interest you   Then  get out there and try stuff   While you're doing this  try to figure out what you like dislike about a certain activity   Eventually  you'll figure it out Meetup group    Where like people talk and plan events  And do said plans together    That's a thing    I can't comprehend why one human would be this cruel to another  The memory is still so fresh and I've had nightmares about it since  I don't feel safe where I live  where I work  I'm always watching my back  Especially in rooms where we are off camera  He's just acting like nothing has happened and able to carry on with his life  all the while I'm scared to death  funny and sad at the same time   nbsp   well that just describes my life perfectlyThank you and I'm glad I could help   I told this friend a few months ago that I believe everyone we meet has a lesson to teach us   I appreciate the lessons he taught me and I wish he could remain a part of my life   But  as he would put it  I've got to follow the omens  and right now the omens seem to point to us parting ways I know  I know  I live in a small town and the chances that we will see each other in the street aren't slim  If I can't find a new home I'm gonna have to leave the town altogether Sounds like weird sex games dude  Unless you're into that sort of thing  I'd politely decline You moved things with him beyond friendship and he clearly still has romantic feelings for you and thought you would be together  You left him for someone else  this isn't rocket science  He is never going to be your platonic friend again  he wants you to be his girlfriend  You don't want that so now you have to say goodbye  I hear ya  I just disagree  What you are doing is successfully changing the subject  you're not convincing people you are too busy to have a girlfriend  No one believes that  You're politely telling them it's none of their business  which is right  I've always found the most direct method is best  "Well you did throw up in Uber last night  I got knocked for the cleanup fee of  200 "It's not a lie you just have to be a little more patient  work towards always improving yourself and focus on being happy  It's one of the hardest things to do but incredibly worth itI struggle with depression and found that having my child changed the face of my depression in ways I never anticipated and made it hard for me to recognize my illness   I want you to know that your feelings do not make you a bad person or a bad mother   It doesn't mean you don't love your son   But that love isn't always enough to make the hell and torture of being a parent go away   Every parent I know has had moments where they struggled with patience and being the kind of parent they wanted to be   I found it incredibly isolating to feel like I was the only mother who wasn't enraptured and completely fulfilled by having a child  I reached out to friends but nobody was going through what I was   Getting professional help made all the difference  but going back to work helped too     If you ever need to talk  I'm here   Thank you for getting help   I think that's my problem  I'm too forgiving  even to those who don't deserve my forgiveness  I can't tell the police because it's the whole "he said  she said" case  and then X'll hunt me down for telling them Limiting contact with him is best  If you feel he will start getting aggressive with your mum  again  I would recommend counseling  Especially for him  It seems like he may have some outstanding problems that need to be dealt with professionally  If you believe that at any time he may be physically aggressive with your mother  don't hesitate to take legal action  I know that you won't let anything too bad happen  Things appear to be looking up for you  I'm glad you have a plan  You've got this  Feel free to PM me if you have any questions or just want to talk vent  Everybody's different  that's all I can say   Some people just don't want other people around that much   Sounds like you are  intensely  around people on your job  so it makes sense you'd need to be alone otherwise     If you changed to a less stressful job  things might change  Or they might not   Mothers ask the gay question because that's what they know how to do  and because the media tells them to     If I had any advice worth taking  it might be just to figure out what you want in life    what would actually make you happy   If you need help to do that  many do  especially since you don't have friends to bounce things off   If you wanted to change your life  I would make this your first priority because only then would you understand what you actually wanted to do change   Human baby cries are designed to trigger   moms   parents to want to fix it    Believe me  works on dads too  She is not at all ugly and three years older than me  I would love to fulfill her fantasy with full secrecy and no male on male contact  but I know what you mean I'm going to go to my management tomorrow and explain what has happened and if nothing comes of it  quit Ok thank you  should I book another appointment or is there a simpler way  I lost my father in a similar way when i was 17  ventricular arrythmia as he was working out at the gym at 54  He was also my absolute best friend in the world  and that is irreplaceable  I still have moments when i cry to this day  12 years later  It gets easier  but it's never really gone  And at this point I'm glad it isn't  because it reminds me how much that love meant to me  and still does  I'm sorry you had him taken from you so early and unexpectedly  and it's an experience I'd never wish on anyone  But I'm still so blessed and happy I had him as a father  even though it felt like such a short time to have had him  Hang in there  and do what you need to to grieve  as other people said  And don't stuff away your love for him because it feels easier to bear the loss  because that love will comfort you for the rest of your life  that much i can promise you  Hang in there  and I'm sure I'll think of you often in the coming year   feel free to pm me anytime  and i truly mean that  Take care  and God bless you and your family have you tried talking about it to admissions counselors elsewhere  If you explain your gpa it will probably actually give you a boost in admissions because it shows that you're still determined to stay in academia and give your best even when the going gets tough As someone who has been lied to by a significant other and found out the truth afterwards  my stance on this is that the lie is definitely the worst part  Because he was afraid of what I might think or do  he chose not to tell me what was going on  By withholding the truth  he tried to control what information I had access to  and by extension  he tried to control my feelings and reactions  That right is mine alone  and your girlfriend's  If you have honour and self respect  as well as respect for her  you'll tell the truth  and let her make her own decision on how to respond  I'm 33 and live in MinneapolisI'll never forget the time a "normie" friend of mine tell me he purposely stopped hanging out with a group of his friends because they were too "weird" and "clingy" for him    nbsp   Some people can just be so selfish  They fail to realize just how important something may be worth simply because they have it It doesn't really matter in this case  you guys aren't friends  you were more because you had sex  He obviously still at least wants to have sex with you and that will put a strain on your current relationship  It'll be best to cut all ties if you want to continue it He's trying to make you feel jealous   Yeah I bought a journal today as a sort of all purpose note taker  that's a good place to start Yeah you should poop  I'd also assume  just like any other bandage  that it should be changed regularly  Call your doctor's office asap and see what they say  They may have missed going over some after care instructions with you Thanks for the advice  and happy new year too    I don't think you should be comparing yourself to others  I know that's really hard and that's kind of how society is built  but just become someone's "better" doesn't mean that you're lesser than them  So long as you're doing the best you can  I think you'll see some changes   Doing the best you can doesn't mean what you're doing right now  You have the ability to finish your homework on time and you have the ability to talk to someone  like a teacher  I'm not saying you have to study 24 7  but you can certainly at least finish your homework  Successful people don't necessarily have high IQs  but rather know how and when to ask for help and know how to persevere She needs therapy like yesterday   and jesus too"""""Looks don't matter """""   nbsp   Added quotations to emphasize just how stupid and untrue this is Man I don't even have 3 friends Honestly to me  it sounds a little ridiculous but I guess as long as you can convince your family and friends to go along with it  go for it www Meetup comTry and get close to the person you know who you like the most from those that you know   They'll naturally introduce you into their friend group over time from my perspective a hobby is something that you enjoy and do in your free time which is why it's probably impossible for someone to give you them as the experience is different  However if your asking for generic ones that would normally fit the bill for guys is maybe Sport  gaming  comics anime  popular movies tv shows  travel of course these are just off the top of my head and most of these may not apply depending on your age range and background Good luck on the path to self improvement    ugh thats creepy tbhFrom what you describe  it seems pretty emotionally complicated and volatile  If you do decide to play along  expect all

bought with money  not good looks  It pays to be a materialistic person she wants you bro but if your sick of the emotional rollercoaster I would avoid tell her you want to be friends and move on of course if you think she still worth a try then go get em   Regarding Roombas   Never  ever use them if there's possibly a shit on the floor at the same time I don't really know if I would have done anything 10 minutes later  but I guess we'll never know now  I don't want to make excuses  it's just that I was with my friends and watching fireworks etc  and she didn't give me much of a chance  I can imagine everything you said could be how she's feeling  I'm sure it is actually  Well  thanks for your input  I appreciate it All pedantry aside  this is what we refer to as a "metaphor " Of course the brain is not literally a muscle  but many have likened it to a muscle  which can be developed through use and repetition  In this way  the two are analogous  even though the mechanisms are quite different    Unless of course you were just joking  in which case  lolI'll wish he was dead for you   What a terrible thing to live with   I am so sorry you have to deal with that I don't think she'll be creeped out  probably flattered  Also  depending on her tastes  I don't know how much you know about her  she might like mushy lovey dovey stuff or really hate it  Personally  I hate it   If you're delivering a card don't you have to see her face to face anyway  I think the best plan of action is to say what you want to say to her in person and give her the card with the song lyrics  As for the song itself  Bruno Mars  Idk I have zero knowledge about good songs these days You have an "out of your league" hot wife who is obsessed with your penis  That definitely isn't a loser in my book  Just a dude in a shitty toxic situation I don't know if this helps but shows like criminal minds and Lie To Me are good at showing body language and explaining it especially Lie To MeIt sure is complicated  I feel like I don't want anything of that sort with my girlfriend and personal life  I definitely enjoy the fantasy but always get an anxiety attack when I am close to it  I would never do it with my girlfriend because she is not into it and I would never force it upon her  Well  sometimes you just gotta tell them that you feel that they're toxic to you and you don't want to be around them  That would be simplest  albeit dramatic  method  If they're known to be assholes by everyone then the only one who'll think you're the asshole in the situation is them   If you want to skirt around it  just gradually stop hanging out with them  Don't make up lies  tell them valid reasons to not hang out  Try to avoid them so that you just naturally fall apart  Try to make new friends too Hi    I want to start of by saying that students shouldn't be compared  Just as different people have different learning methods  different students have different rhythms  And just because you're taking more time in this phase does not mean you're less smarter or that you'll forever have a slower rhythm    Here's a few things that can help you     Find your learning method  be it listening to people explain  making summaries  reading a lot of times  etc  just find something that helps you   Use little trick to memorize things  most subjects you should aim to understand but let's be realistic there's always something that's outright memory  For me mnemonics work really well especially stupid ones  Really they don't have to make that much of a sense as long as that somehow stays with you   Ask for more activities  it shows your dedication and it would get you better prepared for finals    Talk to teachers or other students   if you're struggling with a subject just ask your friends or your teachers  Nobody minds giving you some help and it's better than studying everything from scratch by yourself  Most importantly  have confidence in yourself  Despite everything in your life  you've made it through  this is just one more year  And if for some reason you do end up a super senior  Own it  don't let labels put you off  There's nothing to be ashamed of  Just as friend D is now doing well  you wil also be better in the future   Wish you the best  It's your body  you can do what you want   I don't have any chest hair  but I do have armpit hair   Like all the men in my family  I do absolutely nothing with my armpit hair And that was the last we heard from  u GonnaLiveTo120Get new friends That is horrific  I'm so sorry that happened to you  Please know you are not alone  Find a therapist  they are equipped to help you through it  and are confidential  If you need to just chat  you can pm me   I'll admit  I maintain a personal fb page    No matter what I say  usually to wish people happy holidays  post a funny picture  no one but my aunt acknowledges me    My fb friends are high school friends who haven't known me for ten years but they all follow the pages of a handful of people who post inane quotes and the same shit  really    Same with twitter  different audience  but similarly  people I've known for years  No one to talk to  I tweet the same jokes  commentary  and retweets everyone else does     if people don't care about you  it doesn't matter what effort you make  But I know hey see  Once in a while this horrible girl that I follow subtweets to me insult me  I feel like a lot of people are suggesting ways to absorb more information such as reading  movies  etc  but to me it sounds like you are an intelligent person who knows a lot already but just doesn't know how to express themselves  I would put myself in the same category  which is why I'm in this subreddit   and one thing that helps me is writing my different musings in a journal  This gives me a chance to sort of practice ordering my thoughts about a particular matter before I have to speak them out loud to someone else Wow you are one lucky bastard  But yea  it's the first offense thing that probably spared you  My first offense was a felony  but the fact that it was my first and I was 14 helped when it came to the plea deal  It will always be visible to courts but I don't have to report it when I apply for jobs and I can still vote  But yea  it's still ridiculous that we criminalize pot  I'm glad you're doing okay though I'm sorry    Did you go at all    Good parents let their kids enjoy their peers a little   I truly believe that  It's humiliating being at that age and having to explain your parents won't let you enjoy that time of your life   Even in a strict culture  It's humiliating  A library card is free  Is that some shitty sex advice Rejection is an unfortunate but normal part of life  Maybe you're just not his type  Kinda hesitant to join  4 of my best friends have all joined  and all in different branches and are absolutely MISERABLE right now    err  hey dude I'm not sure how you came to think I would play drums with you on open mic night but I don't feel comfortable doing that  I'm happy for you that you're giving this a go and I can come to support you but I do not want to be part of the performance  Contact the press if the company doesn't do anything  Other victims may see it and speak up too "Thank you for being willing to share your struggle with me  How can I help you with it  I'm here to listen to whatever you have on your mind" I know  he kinda lead me on so I get that part of it  I just feel like I should have been smarter than that and seen that before I asked him    Host your own parties  A party doesn't have to be 50 people with alcohol  weed  and or girls  Those movies that have a ton of people where the cops show up and everyone runs away aren't real  Besides the parties I went to would eventually end up with two douchebags outside in a fight   The parties don't matter in the long run  My older brother gave me some really good advice right before I graduated from highschool  in the end you're only going to end up with two or three really good friends  It's the truth  When you get older you're going to realize this bullshit truly didn't matter  I know it's not what you want to hear  I'm sure you've heard it already  and I remember the feeling that you're probably feeling right now  The feeling I'm talking about is the feeling that it doesn't matter what you will think in the future  everything that's every going to be important in your life is only ever going to happen now  BULLSHIT   I can promise you buddy that you're going to end up with one or two really good friends  The guys you think you'll be friends with forever won't be the one or two  I have a friend I've known since first grade  we're like brothers  but over the years we've grown apart  we have different ideas and ambitions  My best friend right now  I basically acted like a teenage girl when we were in highschool  he should not have stayed friends with me  But I know he and I would take a bullet for one another  I know if I called him right now and told him I needed help he'd do it   Focus on being the best type of friend a guy would want and stop trying to mold yourself into what they want   I really want to reach through this phone and give you a hug and tell you to slow the fuck down and not give too many shits about what other people think about you  Know that 90 percent of all men in America know how you feel  and have had it happen to us    It is never easy to put yourself out there  and you'll always wonder "what's wrong with you" when things don't work out   But the point is that you'll never know what's going on inside another person's head in these situations   It may have nothing to do with you or how worthy you are   Be nice to him in the future  but keep making new friends and keep seeing where the road takes you   I would encourage you to keep taking the initiative whenever you think it's what you want to do    But they have been broken up for like 6 years Unfortunately it happens to us all  I was turned down by this girl I was getting close with  You just pick up your things  figuratively  and move on Thanks  I appreciate it I admit  in some ways I think I actually am picky considering my position  not that I really get options anyway    I went through a phase in my late teens where I told myself I didn't really care what the guy looked like or whatever  as long as we could get along and actually liked the idea of dating a guy with mental illness or something  since I had a problem with this myself and found it really interesting   It didn't really work  I got to know'ish two guys from a mental health support forum I used to frequent  one wasn't bad looking but had schizophrenia and used to send me big long conspiracy theory filled messages on fb and I kinda picked up he had really bad anger issues  he got banned from the mental health forum for threatening mods   I got along with another guy who was friendly but clingy  I'm fat so I didn't mind when he said he was fat  but he sent me a picture of himself and he was absolutely huge  he said he was 27st  just under 400 lbs    I had no attraction to him whatsoever  it ended up fizzling out  Neither were exactly immediate dating prospects or asked me out or anything  though    I'm not suggesting I'm holding out for some male model or whatever  but I do like somewhat conventionally attractive guys who are of average weight or buff  being fat I know that's hypocritical   have very caring and protective personalities  and share some of my interests  indeed I'd love an 'average' looking man with these qualities  I would still date a man with mental illness too  I don't actually care about things like money  I wouldn't care if he was on the dole  Mostly I'd just want a guy who could carry a conversation with me at my pace     One of the things is that since I've never dated I've kind of just always fantasized  I don't have the experience or any real idea of what guy would be good for me  I have a fake account on POF and I do just like to window shop at unattainable guys  But I wouldn't want my mirror opposite in male form   I'm used to being single and have decided it's better to just stay single than attempt to 'settle' for the next thing that has a dick who is also attempting to settle  because I couldn't stand  a  being resented and  b  feeling resentful myself  It's just as well I don't get offers and won't unless maybe  and it's a big if  I massively improve myself   I'm so sorry for your loss  I understand how you feel  as the day my Father passed away was the hardest day of my life Well i dont tell people that so i got that covered  I agree though  A parent needs to understand that a social life is important for development as well  Doing well in school and not getting into legal trouble isnt the only goal for a young person    My mother will always bug me for not knowing how to dance but dancing doesn't happen at home  it happens in parties  Either way the damage is done  Hopefully my mom isn't one of those annoying mothers that wonder why im single He was actually as responsive as I needed him to be  I addressed this in another comment earlier today  I am appreciative of your concern  suggestions and support  Yes  HRT basically does everything except give you a vagina and reverse bone structure changes  Edit  and doesnt change your voiceHe aviods me now and I won't see him as much  but he might tell everyone  He was the first guy I asked in a while but I don't want to be labeled as desperate or anything or a psycho  We work together in a medium sized place  I feel or all the guys in the world now  what a shitty feeling  I'll be nice to him when I see him it'll just be awkward  Because nothing changes and we stay jaded    Try the honey version  Interested in any advice here  I'm in somewhat the same boat as OP  It's sabotaging my efforts to fix my longtime relationship ruined by my depression bipolar Thank you I wish you all the strength and support for your fight  He sounds pretty selfish IMHO  been there    I would talk to him about how it made you feel and how he should reciprocate and not be such an asshole  Or he'll lose his bj privileges  or you'll find someone better or something  Even if you enjoy giving head  eventually you'll get tired of just getting ignored and basically feeling used  At school during any downtime like in the morning or at lunch I just sit somewhere and stare at people and want to die  I should probably stop   I'm so happy to hear you are doing better for yourself and I thank you for your support and listening ears  I have one  It's just too far for me to go to hangout everyday  I forgot to mention we both share a car too   You can either spend a few more years and let it grow to 100  million or just sell it now  A middle class commoner making  50grand per year makes just under  3million when retirement is reached  Most of the people reading this will not even make close to that in a lifetime         You'd have ten times that amount if you cashed out now and got a normal job or passion to occupy your time  Having money does not mean you have to live extravagantly either  I love how Socrates put it       Contentment is natural wealth  Luxury is artificial poverty   akemashite omedeto gozaimasu  to you too my dude    Where in Japan are you living  I'd like to live somewhere in Asia for a few years  past experience has taught me how much fun it is to be be immersed in a completely foreign culture  having to deal with the accompanying challenges all alone  I'm 17 too and I can't imagine being competent enough at anything to tutor little kids so uh  good job I guess  Why do you think you have no friends Thanks I appreciate this  I live in a not so welcoming town and have made various decisions based off what I think people would think of me  While I know this isn't the right way to live I can't just ignore the community I live in  I just want to have a group of friends  I'm sure I won't talk to them in the long run but how can I just ignore this feeling right now I think your right   He should eat it where do you go to parties like this  The ones I've been in usually have very very few girls without partners if any ever  and usually have dozens of single guys racing each other to swoop in on whatever girl that's not being attended to  I've never been approached by girl  Like ever  And I've been to quite a few parties I'm sorry you had to go through this  The best thing you can do is forgive and move on  In the end  forgiveness isn't about them  it's about you  You'll be able to be at peace and not hold so much pain anger hatred in your heart  You'll be able to be happy and have a more fulfilling life w o the negativity you feel now  Do you work The "You don't have to look far to see how well you have it" quote definitely applies here  Damn dude  I'm sorry you had to go through all of thatYup  that's why I only speak 2nd hand on dog ownership and Roombas And     this is going to sound really callous but youre obviously not over him  Its ok  Maybe you need more time  Maybe you need to let go    but time and a concerted effort should help  You cant save everyone no matter how nice they are  take care of you  enjoy your time with the new guy  if you dont youre going to lose him and end up with nothing  I think it sounds like a good solution to an annoying problem   It's not like you chose to have your birthday on NYE   If I were you  though  I'd throw yourself a "delayed" or "belated" birthday party  it sounds less ridiculous   And then when somebody asks when your actual birthday is  you can explain the whole thing Yeah a lot  Aw thanks   What do you mean I pulled   They remain sealed to this day  The Times reviewed thousands of pages of them   If items are under seal  how is that The Los Angeles Times was able to review them Don't feel guilty  I'm sure you helped your ex as much as you could during the time you were together  If he doesn't want to help himself  you're only going to be hurting because you feel powerless  I was in a similar situation and had to walk away because in the end I was destroying myself trying to fix him  This is a very good post  One thing I've noticed  off topic  is that single dads are praised more than single moms  I'm not talking for the whole world just my area and experience  Its odd how people treat others in specific circumstances but I highly agree this all needs to change kids or no kids  single or taken etc Add an extra 200 Calories  a day of clean and lean food baked chicken breast  grilled fish Thanks so much that is great advice and I do like him  only problem is I'm 15 and not allowed to date     But hopefully soon I can do this    But how are you 100  sure  What did he do to make you so sure  Have a good day too Hell Yeah  That sounds really heavy   I'm sorry you've had a pretty rough time so far   Is there anything in particular that you can think of which would help things improve to start out the new year man fuck that weddingI appreciate that  and I'll give that a go  Thank you so much for your help  It's been incredibly useful and Ihope that we can sort this out soon Thank you both    it worked out well  One of my family members was like is "she going to come over after the movie " And someone else said that's up to me  and that's what I politely declined  Your advice helped a lot     Keep going  Keep fighting  Don't give up    Hugs  Dumb question  do they have program or career advisers at your school who can help out   Maybe even suggest options for you email her the link to the video using an anonymous email client like https   www guerrillamail com Caloric surplus  eat more calories than you are burning  Make sure you are tracking your macros  fats  carbs  protein   Eat things such as pasta  potatoes  breads  fruits  high in carbs   Peanuts  peanut butter  olive oil  avacados  high in fats   Chicken  turkey  lean beef  eggs  nonfat Greek yogurt  high in protein Nothing is going to change in a relationship like this  It sounds like he does not even value you  Best of luck on what comes next in the relationshipAh  Also just noticed I engrished again   Your post is very touching and heartbreaking and I'm really impressed by you  Even if you feel helpless or guilty or a million different things  what I took away is that your are brave and loving  Whatever kind of help you seek  you are showing strength just by asking for it  I understand this feeling  I recently asked my classmate to hangout and I never heard from him after he personally asked me for my number  I felt embarrassed for every thing I did to get his attention  until a few days ago when I realized that I was just doing what I wanted  So  don't ever feel embarrassed for doing something that you want  All you wanted was to create a bond with him  and it simply didn't work out  You should feel proud that you were able to put yourself on the line and voice how you felt  It takes a lot for someone to ask someone else out  It shows that you're confident  willing  and have enough courage  Use that same drive to accept that he's not interested  It happens to every single person on planet Earth  If you have a rewards card for your local grocery stores you can usually go online to their website and add relevant coupons to your card account every few weeks  It's easy to do and no clipping or giant binders The more you elaborate  the more I get the sense that you're comfortable with where you are with this  which I wasn't as sure of from your first post  I'm pleased to see that that's the case  I suppose I was coming from a place where  when I first started discovering my own "interests " I wavered with a lot of guilt and friction over how to compartmentalize it  It took me way too long to figure out that guilt is the entirely wrong way to frame the reaction to your own identity  Again  I can understand the need to be reserved about saying certain things  though  and frankly  I still have mostly that same disposition towards my own kinks  Some of them manifest gradually as I come to trust a relationship  but others might never  The shame element of that decision is no longer an issue  though  which I'm happy to say   In any case  I'm glad it helped to ventilate it  Here's to solidarity and lightening our own baggage loads where we can The first two is pretty much my 2016 too You're reading this right  Awesome  Is there a way you can read this while listening to a song on youtube   If so  awesome  If not  don't trouble yourself with it  it is perfectly alright  my friend  Though I think this song will help inspire you while you read this  Please listen to it regardless as I think what you need is motivation  https   youtu be D7hm1gI17e0  Firstly  listen to  u FMP11 's advice  They know their stuff and I can vouch for them  My friend  I know life beats you down and you just want to surrender this time around to just maybe try again at a later time  but now is the time  Trust me on this  You CAN do this  and you know it  Sit down the controller  put on some tunes in a headset  and hit the books  Nothing comes easy  This is true  Don't let the titles others put on you limit the person you are meant to be  Autistic  stupid  loser  purple  Please excuse my language as I don't mean to offend  but fuck purple  This is YOUR life  not theirs  We all have our demons who degrade us with every step we take  but we can't let them hold us down forever  Grab the reins and take what's been yours from the very beginning  This is your life  and you can make a difference  no matter what the demons in the back of our heads say to us  You are greater than your faults  Cause trust me  we all have them  but don't let the fault rule or you'll never make it through  Let your passion burn you even when it's not easy  Don't be smothered by the weight of life's problems  They'll always be there  but you will overcome in your perseverance  I have faith in you  brother  Get up  You got this  And after you conquer school  and stand at the door to what comes after  don't despair  even if you start out at a very basic job  Pick up a skill you enjoy  even if you're absolutely terrible at it  Trust me on this one  My dream of writing was crushed by a teacher when I was a child  and it wasn't till over a decade later that I finally told those demons in my head that I won't be bound by them anymore  I've been writing for a couple years now  I haven't made a career out of it just yet  but I have gotten better at saying what needs to be said  That is the basis for all writing  along with the complex world I've built by having a child like wonder  No matter what anyone tells me  I know now that I am a writer  even if no one else acknowledges me as such  So my friend  take heart and don't despair  Take up an art you enjoy and keep working at it  You only ever get better with continued perseverance  Just like your schooling  You can do this  Have faith  and get up     I had a friend I was semi close with not come to my wedding  and ten years later it still makes me a bit sad to think about it   It's one night that will be remembered for the rest of her life  do you want her  thinking  "I thought me and  r wildflowermural were friends  why didn't she come to my wedding " For decades to come  Wasn't smoking  but clearly dropping heat Take from someone who tried and failed a couple of years ago  Don't   Sometimes I'll joke around and make suicide jokes  but in this case I'm gonna be serious   It's alright if you aren't the most popular guy around  It's alright if no girl likes you    I know this sounds harsh but bear with me  My solution was to find people that made me happy  People whom I shared interests with  For example  the people I hang out with on Teamspeak  or play dungeons and dragons  or Warhammer 40k with   Collage is a new world with likely more people  You'll find people  at least one  that likes you  I promise it   I know you've probably heard this before  but it does get better   I'm sorry you're going through this I'm sorry this happened  Please get tested in case that asshole had something  I echo the sentiments above about therapy    I'm here if you need someone to talk to  If it's leg is hurt  maybe taping a toothpick snap off ends to blunt them  or matchstick to it will help its leg set heal  We did this to a rat once and it helped    I hate to say it but it sounds like your parents let him get away with too much  I mean why wouldn't he be an asshole if he can just totally get away with it and your parents will still do whatever he wants  No one has forced him to grow up and now he's 28 and acting like a 7 year old who hasn't realized he isn't the center of the universe yet  and takes his family relationships for granted  I don't know how to fix that  but I bet he is projecting some harbored resentment towards the family since he had to rely on other people for a while You are NOT a failure  the first year of motherhood can be wonderful and it can also be absolute  hell   Tesla  Age of the kid  A 4 year old is going to be very different than a 14 year oldYou should go for it  Yes I have a full time job  still find myself being bored after I get out of work though  I have about 6 hours to spare before I go to sleep every night and I don't work weekends  That's the thing though  You have three friends  Many people here have none and have never had any Sounds like you have anxiety  If you couldn't walk  because of a shattered leg bone  would you feel like a failure  or call for help   I've been right there where you are  And  I want you where I am  now  Three teens and i have grey hair     So two things  You realize that geting yourself help is actually helping your child  and have your child checked for problems that might be causing the cry fits    I had three babies  in diapers  at  the same time  Sometimes  I would baby proof the room  lock them in with me  and put on cartoons  while they played and I laid on the bed sobbing   I eventually got help    I hated being a zombie  Told my dr and we slowly found a dosage that was a happy medium  At my darkest  I always focused on the baby's safety   Please know that you are NOT alone  you are NOT a failure  I have two little girls and I've always told them that they can date whoever they want and love whoever they want  I sincerely hope it's a complete non issue  societally  by the time they're teenagers  We're getting there  slowly  but we are I'm incredibly proud of you  I'm not happy to hear about the sad things that happened to you  but you've clearly been very brave and awesome this year  Congratulations Today has been pretty decent   I'm spending the night with my sister and her boyfriend   We went to Olive Garden for lunch dinner then saw a movie   It was called Fences   I wasn't a fan but my parents and sister liked it   My sister  her boyfriend and I went and got ice cream at some place downtown  I was a little disappointed that the only lactose free flavor they had was vanilla  but I got it anyway because I didn't have any lactaid with me  and then we had cocktails at a rooftop bar   I swear this one I had was amazing   It was some martini with lavender and rhubarb flavors that felt very fancy   Now we're back at her boyfriend's place drinking wine and watching Finding Dory on Netflix   I'm hungry but I feel bad about eating his food   I wish I could order a pizza or something  Gotcha  Well  you could always make like a weekly trip to the biblio and get 5 or 6 books to last you until the next week  You could set a goal  like reading all the Booker prize winners  or a book from everyone who won a Nobel prize  This is always my reaction to this type of post  I've never been asked this by friends or relatives  In fact  the few times I've made hypothetical references to situations 'if I ever were to get married'  others look very uncomfortable  and look away or at the floor  or just laugh nervously Go and then have a bath afterward  Many people before you have had this kind of surgery  So this is not new to the medical staff   The key to a fast recovery is keeping it clean   And not eating anything spicyExcept we're not socialized to believe it  It's something that's been ingrained in us for thousands of years  There's very few spieces that need social and romantic interactions in order to have a fulfilled life and we happen to be one of them Damn son  You're in 10th grade  Cut yourself some slack  Everyone hates high school  Just bare your teeth and get through it  When it's over you'll be saying  "damn high school was fast " When I was in high school I spent my time with a small handful of friends because I trusted them  I thought the norm of having a bunch of friends was bullshit  Most teens are backstabbing assholes anyway  Your friend has separate interests which is normal  Can still be friends no problem  I like computers  yet my buddy  who I've been friends with for 10  years  loves to lift  We're still friends to this day  Bonded stronger than anything in this world  I'm 22 with a steady job  a kid and a wife  I still have no clue what I want to do with the rest of my life  I don't think anyone really knows because life is too unpredictable  But i'll go back to the fact that your only 14  Go easy on yourself and just focus on school  Get it over with it and get a job and make mad money  Buy yourself your own gym  Just work hard  Good luck buddy I get it every year   You're not alone  I absolutely dread New Year's Eve Day   Personally I think it is part melancholy sadness over bad things in the past year  and anxiety about the coming year   Also I think that staying up until midnight and watching the ball drop when I was young coupled with all the noise afterwards gave me a bad taste in my mouth and maybe even slight trauma   I usually just focus on getting through the two day span  try not to watch too much news and just think about getting back into the regular routine afterwards  I hope this is helpful  Somebody  in some way  gave them to the LA Times    I don't know anyone who became close friends with someone after high school  college  they just become too busy with family and work and don't give a fuck about youI was going to suggest this too    And to see a doctor because I don't think the pain you're describing is normal  even for very frequent self love You're welcome for the advice   I'm female  though   Well  are you just introverted or do you want friends   I'll be your friend  you can message me whenever you want   It sometimes makes me feel bad for a little bit  when it happens  but I prefer that instead of sexual harassment   I just think they must be projecting their own insecurities onto me because I really don't see the point in telling me I'm ugly like I'm unaware of it   It really is quite pointless  when you think about it that way  so I try not to waste my time ruminating about it   What have they mocked you about   Maybe they are just jealous  I don't want to hijack your thread but I'm going to do one of these soon In many states  you can report an unsafe driver to the DMV  Department of Motor Vehicles  and they'll ask the person to come in and be retested  Here's the link for California   https   www dmv ca gov portal dmv  1dmy urile wcm path  dmv content en dmv pubs brochures fast facts ffdl10  I also would refuse to get in a car with him again  Sorry  yeah he's 3 HRT really depends on how early you start  You should be fine   And yes there is  Cost around  20 000Yes  Some people are bullies  and they dont like it when they arent in control  Also  dont forget that some people enter into situations expecting an argument  so its about learning to differentiate between the naturally hostile person  and the angry person expecting you to be a dick  From there you can choose an appropriate response   All kids that age think their parents at mean half the time  it comes with the job   Just be there to support her  share stories of when the kids said things like that to you as well   As long as she knows you love and care about her and her feelings  its going to be the biggest difference in the world  A starting point is to just go outside and spend some time in the outdoors  It has wonderful effects on your mental health  while the walking is great light cardio  Plus  you feel a sense of accomplishment afterwards  especially if you find someone you can share the experience with    Of course  that's easier said than done  but it was vital in my recovery from a depressive episode this past summer    Hope 2017 holds positive change for you yoThank you Call the cops  If needed  Victim services  or what ever they're called  can help find a place to stay once charges are pressed  I'm sure the Red Cross or even other city services exist to help in situations like this  You don't need to wait to find a job  you need to deal with this asshole now Thank youThank you for the encouragement and support Im 18 and in college now  I see all my high school friends parting ways and I feel the same way  I think about all that every night but tbh  its not like youre alone  everyone you know is growing up with you and you still feel youthful all the way up to your 40s so you still have a long way to go  just dont think about it     Don't like it here  Than leave I'm pretty sure 90  of the people here know this  It's hard to leave though   Commenting here is practically the only human interaction I get all day  I think I'd go insane without this place  That  and it's nice talking to people who understand  even if most of the talking revolves around self pity and bitterness  I'd have suggested taking out a small loan and paying back asap to help maintain your job  but with bad credit  that might be hard  Give it a shot anyway  but know you cannot be hesitant to pay it back if you do get it    If you're currently living alone  I'd suggest finding a roommate and negotiate something with them  If not that  then find someone you can roommate with and  again  negotiate  Just make sure it's not dangerous   Living with someone can drastically cut your bills  but you'll have to work hard and put in all the effort you can to show keep the job and start improving from there    I also suggest taking a visit to r personalfinance as they can provide more detailed advice than I   I think that's the exact name of the subreddit   It sounds like you're struggling to stay afloat and you're doing whatever you can do survive  If you aren't  and you are slacking even a little bit  you need to step up and put in all the hard work you can to make sure you don't collapse under this cumbersome weight   You must keep this up  It requires a lot of self sacrifice but it is imperative that you do so  If you only have one job  and a lot of time still  find a second job  Get enough of an income to get you on your feet  Then start taking care of yourself  You need to stay healthy in order to keep working  Not only for that  but also to improve your mood and happiness in general    I'm not sure how much you've tried  but give talking to your parents another shot  Try to be a bit assertive and show how much you care to improve  Negotiate with them if you can  Maybe say something like "Parents  I need some help  I know you don't want to lend me a hand  but I need it to prevent myself from falling to the ground  None of us desired life to twist this way  but right now I'm asking you to help me twist it back  Have faith in me this one final time  And if i fail  " or something the lines of that    I'd give more future but right now you need help for the immediate future    I don't know what else to advice besides just saying that you need to work as hard as you can to survive  As bad as this is  you have fear of a worse future to push you  and a desire for a better future for a pull    If you need someone to talk to  I'm here  I could maybe provide more advice or guidance   or just friendship  with more time  Just stay strong  keep putting in all the effort you can  dont be afraid to negotiate  and don't give up   I'm sorry to hear all that bad happened to you  And though I wish you a better future  it's up to you to make it better    Good luck  and be safe Want to sound like an intelligent person  Then strive to be able to express complex ideas with the simpliest words  not the other way around as many try Turn the TV on  Listen to music  Read some comics  Play some videogames  Just do your own thing   Call one of those buddies up and ask if they want to come over for videogames and watch some Rick and Morty That's a great idea  thanks ill definitely do that  None Your 15 and having these thoughts  Just know everyone deals with something  EVERYONE  Now listen here  get some perspective  always do whats best for you if you can but realize not everything is going to go your way  You said you like to explore yourself  Well do it more  find what lights your fire and what makes you happy  you do not need anyone to make you happy be glad of the time you spend alone and make the most of it  Work out  write in a journal  dont depend ln drugs  kiss a pretty girl  find new friends  be passtionate  do you  and most importantly do not give a fuck what anyone thinks  The best time to plant a tree is 10 years ago  second best time is now  Stop being a bitch  be the greatest you you can be  and believe in yourself Ignore the bottom dwellers on Red Pill  They're a minority and their opinion doesn't reflect how the majority of society thinks  There's a reason why so many people ridicule look down on them  Besides  men with such shallow notions of attractiveness aren't the kind of guys you want to have chasing after you anyway    First of all  you can do little things to help slow the aging process  For instance  I wear sunscreen all year round  damaging UV rays are present even in winter   moisturise 2x day and don't smoke  I also use prescription skin creams  get regular exercise  eat healthily and try to get enough sleep  I put more effort into this stuff than most people I know  but I recognise that this is the only body that I get  so I want to take care of it and get the most mileage possible      Ultimately though  we're all going to age  This is where you have to work on acceptance  and on finding value within yourself regardless of your youth and appearance  I've experienced the same insecurity you describe at various times over the years  In hindsight  20yr old me was a baby  and while I didn't realise it at the time  I still had so much to learn and so much growth personal development to go through  I expect that this will continue with time    I'm 28 now and while I still sometimes worry about physical aging  it's becoming less important as time goes on  I'm grateful for the knowledge that the years have given me and I can definitely say that I like myself  and feel happier and more confident within myself now than I did at 20  I'm actually really excited for my 30s and 40s  and I feel that whatever wrinkles I gain will be worth it for the wisdom and experience that comes along with them  If someone offered to turn me back into my 20 year old self  I'd absolutely say no   Try to invest in other aspects of yourself  I think the people who struggle the most with ageing are those who don't have a strong sense of self worth or accomplishment beyond their physical appearance  Your value and what makes you attractive to others involves so much more than just your looks  Get an education  take up hobbies  read books  travel   engage in fulfilling activities that connect you with something outside of yourself    Aside from this  I've had friends who died  through either deliberate or accidental causes  before their 25th birthdays  Sometimes I think of them and I'm reminded of the fact that they will never age and will sadly miss out on all the wonderful and exciting things life has to offer  Aging is a privilege that so many are denied  Some people are struck with terminal illness in their childhood or teens  Whenever I start to feel anxious about growing older  I try to remind myself that aging means that I've had the opportunity to live    Also  the whole "over the hill" "not attractive after 25" thing is nonsense IME  I'm 28 and have absolutely no trouble finding men who want to date and or hook up with me  I also know many women in their 30s and 40s who have very active dating love lives  You're nowhere near done yet     I know I'm 4 days late  but still  if you're still there  don't kill yourself  Your father will have what he deserves  trust me  I know It sounds generic  but I doubt your mother or sister can stand him  just like you  In the end  he'll find himself lonely  since he will have chosen that path on his own   Also  I care about you too  I bet we could have been best friends if we met before  You seem like a rational guy  and I also want to be a game developer    Don't give up just yet  You have been enduring that shit this whole time  and mostly  don't give that asshole the pleasure of not having to take care of you anymore  Get help from the police  trust me    PM me if you ever need a new friend   http   imgur com iKcbdLMIt's your turn to live your life and live for yourself I have regular depression and anxiety  I had to go on ativan for a year and a half after my daughters were born because my post partum anxiety was  out of control   I constantly felt guilty  I constantly felt like I wasn't doing a good job  the ativan calmed me down enough to just be able to be in the moment without constantly excoriating myself  I was actually able to enjoy their time as babies  I mean  as much as anyone can when you're never able to sleep through the night   Please get help  you're not alone Fluoride helps teeth  It does not "fuck" them up  Preaching to the choir  As far as your family troubles  always handle all you do with courage  confidence  and humor  Kid  life is meant to be enjoyed and meant to be spent with good feelings and love in your heart  this world needs good people  we dont need another sad person Thank you for the detailed response  i agree that people may think that about me since i often come off as someone who doesnt care about anything though i really do  but wouldnt me constantly arranging meetings and asking them to play games make them think that i really want to hang out with them    Again thanks for the great response i really appreciate you trying to help me It could be that relationships just aren't for you  As long as you're happy in general  who cares  Having kids isn't for some people  Being hetero cis whatever the kids call it these days isn't for everyone  Asexuality is a thing  so having sex isn't for some people   Now  if you feel depressed about not having a relationship  that's different  and perhaps it would be helpful to talk with someone professionally  But if you're just asking because your mom bugged you about it again  then just let her know that you are straight  and you just aren't interested in relationships at the moment  but you appreciate her caring about you  Wait and see if you even receive an invitation first  I know it's anecdotal but depression can totally change the way you act  I pulled out of a depression not too long ago but I'm still paranoid and sometimes I catch myself just being a flat out bitch to people  I doubt it's just him being a jerk of his own volition  Therapy would do him some good  I hope he's receptive to it I know the feeling  I am turning 25 in February and feel ok about it  I used to have a real thing about aging too when I was around your age  Now that I'm older I don't know what I was so worried about  life tends to get better  plus it probably helps that I still look early 20s  What are some of your interests  Have you considered joining any local groups  If you feel like you aren't getting beyond acquaintance level with people  try taking additional steps for one on one activities   For example  if you joined a book club at your library and meet some new folks  take the opportunity to invite one or two of them over to watch a movie adaptation of a book you like  or to join you in another activity they mention they also enjoy    Something else to consider is making a list of three or four things you've always wanted to try but didn't for whatever reason  It gives you a chance to meet some new folks and it's empowering to know you tried something new  which can make you feel more confident  This article really opened my eyes to another side of the issue  I feel like I understand the problem better now  Very interesting  r personalfinance may be better suited for this question Thats about 20 dollars or less a month  You can either go to an informed consent clinic or get a recommendation by a gender therapist   People usually dont get sex reassignment surgery on a whim  Its a major purchase that requires a lot of saving  Or your insurance might cover it  It also requires two medical professionals to sign off on it   Im assuming you're in the US Take up a hobby or craft  Think of something you're good at and become self employed by showing other people how to do it   when you find work you can still do this work on the side   You're 100  correct that therapy will not be effective if you do not trust your therapist  Lack of trust is detrimental to building therapeutic rapport  without which you cannot hope to make progress  My best advice is to disclose to your therapist what you've stated here and devote your sessions to working on this issue  since resolving any other issues will depend on it  I can assure you that it's a common issue and your therapist probably has some inkling that you're not being completely honest  Some therapists will confront their clients about it but perhaps yours is waiting to see if you bring it up  and moving at your pace  Another option would be to seek help from someone else if you think you have a better chance at establishing trust with a different therapist who perhaps possesses different characteristics from your current one Nobody ever wants to speak to me nor does anyone text me or even be near me  Everyone avoids me like I am some kind of disease and will completely ignore me  Also I tutor mostly 12 15 year olds just to clear up that confusion  Most kids hate me too Too much of the stuff is  bad  https   en wikipedia org wiki Dental fluorosis  R exnocontactI've always thought that interesting and intelligent people were the ones who were   curious   about things and might learn a little about a lot of subjects  Like  world intelligence  People with stories about things they've done  places they've gone   a whole bunch of shades to their personality   I live in the tech capital of the world and I'm surrounded by people who are mind blowingly smart in something specific  but can't function outside that one topic   Personally  I think people like you who have a multitude of ideas are the most wonderful kind of person to run into  If you're interested in a topic but afraid to speak up  try asking questions during the conversation  People like to hear themselves talk  and you'll be learning as well  I hope that all makes sense As someone else ITT has already stated  dogs adapt very well to new living conditions  granted they're relatively young  I live with two roommates and we have a german shepherd living with us  he's not even a year old and he's already massive  but he's settled in quite nicely  Just pick a dog that fits your aesthetic preferences   as long as it has the right temperament and training any breed will suffice  Personal preference but imo terriers and smaller "high energy" dogs are the exception  although I do find them annoying so take that with a grain of salt That's a good point  but I don't know if I would consider us semi close    You're right that it's only one night  and I assume she wouldn't send me an invite if she hated me  but I wouldn't want her to pay for a seat for a "semi close friend " But that's just me    Can I ask  did your friend not show because they thought you weren't close  Thanks  that's pretty much it exactly  I'm fine just hanging out with a few friends instead of partying  even though I still feel a little left out for some weird reason  but even that ended up being kind of a bust  It honestly feels kind of nice to just let myself not feel good every now and then  but it was burning me up keeping it up inside  Now that I've talked about it more I feel a LOT better  Thank you guys for listening Repeating a lie over and over again will not make it true I should have said this in the post  but she recently messaged me asking for my address for an invitation     I do have a family that cares and I see professionals but I find everytime I'm in a meeting with a doctor or whatever  I don't care to bring things up that I had been thinking of   About things getting better   that's exactly what I no longer believe  That's very true about the melancholy anxiety  I'd like to think that's not what it is  that it's unrelated to all that  But of course that's a big part of it   That's also an interesting point  When I spend my NYE at home watching the celebration on TV  it's kind of a flashback to years as a child doing the same thing and feeling isolated from the world  If that makes any sense This has to be a joke  how do you let things escalate to this degree  You both need serious psychiatric help  like now Hey OP  I've not lost a job but I have witnessed many others who have either by choice or not  My advice to you is   Get your house in order  get to know yourself  and get out there and be of value to someone or somebody who is in need of help    1  Get your house in order  More so literally  Keep your place clean and make sure it gets done every day  Never slack and get behind   2  Get to know yourself  I believe that you see more of a real you when in times of need  now  That means you get to know who you are and how you get in a low part of your life  Make sure you come out the other side better than before   3  Be of value to someone in need  Volunteering or getting a part time job somewhere where you will be face to face with people all day will help you immensely  Seriously  Being there for someone else will make you feel worth it and you'll also get to brighten someone else's day   I hope you are enjoying your time and hope everything turns out all right I'm going to say something that isn't comforting  but it is probably the right thing to do  Think about this whole matter from C's perspective  Take a long walk in his shoes  He is dealing with depression  and to such a severity that he considered killing himself  Now for whatever reason  I do not know   but it was possibly the fear of losing you as a friend  You may think this doesn't make sense  but depression eats at your cognitive abilities  The thing is  he found someone to confide in  and there was nothing wrong with that  Rather  that confiding in D probably helped him calm down a bit and talk himself down  Your involvement in the matter was out of good intention and I get that  I'm not saying the choice you made was right  as you involved more people whom made C uncomfortable  The thing is  he even apologized to you and you ignored him  He was still depressed and insecure  and wanted to confide in you again  despite what he saw as a betral  Should you make amends  Definitely  but this time  you should be the one apologizing for only escalating what he was going through  I'm not trying to make you feel bad or condemn you in some way  Don't think of it like that  I'm just an outside perspective  What I am driving at is that I would say this guy needs people in his life who are willing to accept him for all that he is  So if you do make amends  be understanding of him and know he's just trying to get by  Just like you and me   Said by someone who has never suffered from being unloved their whole fucking god damned life  This also sounds like something a best friend I had for a while would have said to me  "My pleasure" is definitely one of his phrases  If that's you Andrew  I'm doing alright  And it's okay  I'm not mad  I've got no residual anger or bad feelings  Just good memories  I hope you're doing well too  Happy New Year  My fiancé and I just broke up  We love each other  but it seems like the same thing that's happening to you happened to us  Every time we're together  things are amazing until they just aren't  There's no real reason we can't be together  but these small insignificant arguments just keep popping up  it's like  We  Just  Can't  Make  It  Work    It's incredibly frustrating  and sad  Even now I'm wondering why we're apart  I would relate to this if I actually had any friends at all I have the same goal except it's so that I can ride a sport bike fast Yeah   You were daring for Years because you were in high school and high school has limited choices and cause it's cool to be dating in high school  You are about to enter the big boy play ground    It makes complete sense  Here's hoping that   if only from an internet stranger   you don't feel isolated knowing someone else is sending positive vibes your way I won't say that every adoption is easy  Both my sister and my mother were adopted  I can say that at least twice  it worked out well  I also have at least 3 friends who are adopted and obviously being adopted comes with it's challenges  but IMO it's better than keeping a child you can't properly care for and a great alternative for those that don't agree with abortion or don't have access to it   Also as quick note  closed adoptions are the way to go which avoid the most amount of drama  It's very hard to have a closed inter family adoption  And that can lead to lots of issues   also from personal experience Send her a stupid selfie captioned something along the lines of "Start a streak with me"  Go from there I lost my father 3 months back  He died of multiple organ failure due to septic shock  I spoke to him on phone for less than 20 seconds  I remember asking him  "How do you feel now  daddy " for which he said "still the same dear  "  We both were in different countries  different continents  I travelled to see him when he was in ICU  Everyone said he will be alright  I prayed to god  cried in the flight the whole journey to see him alive  By the time I reached he was on ventilator   I promised him many things while he was in ventilator  Hope was the only thing left  After 4 days of fight  he didn't make it  My last promise to him was  I will take care of mother and will send you to heaven with a smile  I didn't cry  I cried when he received guard of honour as he was a doctor in military  I used to cry alone after that  I didn't want to cry in front of my mother thinking she will become weak  My advice to you would be to stay strong and keep your family strong  gather all the moments and keep it safe  take responsibility and live the life as it comes coz it's unpredictable  Trust me you will come out stronger Ok  So have you looked into hospitalizing yourself in a residential facility  It seems like things are really tough for you right now  and that's not something you can really deal with properly on your own  And it appears that your father clearly has his own set of struggles that makes him not able to properly care for you during yours It all depends on the situation  Sometimes you round down and times you go up  I would just round up Oh my God  Do did we have the same friend  I have one who is exactly as you described  Every so often I take a break from her  we go to different colleges so it's relatively easy to do  but I can't cut her off completely because she does care about me in a roundabout way  But yeah one time we were at a mutual friend's house and the mutual friend's parent asked me  "Don't I know you from  hardware store where I worked in high school  " And before I could even answer she piped up and says  "I worked at a hardware store too "  Not the same one   And I'm like  dude  It's not like he was saying  "Aren't you the only person in this room who's ever worked at a hardware store " He was just making a connection to where he knew me from  The same connection didn't exist for her  but she just had to latch onto anything she could use to return attention to herself  We've been best friends for the better part of a decade  whoa    holy shit  so I know her pretty well and once took a narcissism screening test for her  You can guess what the results were  Haha  I hate saying such horrible things but I do question the friendship a lot   As does everyone I know   But her redeeming qualities make it impossible to break things off  who am I to judge  I have my own issues too  But I guess it comes down to the fact that I'm not judging her  I'm judging my own needs  She just doesn't treat me well 85  of the time  That doesn't mean she's not worthy of friendship at all  mine just probably isn't the best fit for her  Ugh  anyway  Maybe I should have posted in this sub myself  haha  Thanks for providing me with a relatable prompt to get this off my chest  And if you feel really bad about ending the friendship  maybe try the "break" thing that I do  I find that after a few weeks or even months without close contact  I am much fresher and more forgiving toward her  And she's so overbearing that it's easy to resume our friendship from where I we  not explicitly  left off   Another case for there being no absolute value for relationships   But no matter what don't feel too guilty  As long as you weren't a huge jerk in ending the friendship  you 100  deserve to do what's best for you and your emotional health  It's a hard decision to make so good job making positive strides for yourself Something  no  the ONLY thing that has helped me with these difficult issues is the teachings of Buddha  Please read When Things Fall Apart by Pema Chodron  and Radical Acceptance by Tara Brach  Amazing and truthful advice that can transform your suffering into healing  Also  if you need something right now  go to DharmaSeed org and search for Jack Kornfield under teachers  I promise listening to him will help Is your depression due solely to being an atheist and having to hide it  And you also don't need to explain why you're depressed  Maybe you could tell your parents that you've been feeling really depressed recently and ask if they'd help you get professional help  Psychologist do not tell your parents what you talk about during your sessions  and could provide you some really helpful tools to cope with your feelings and guidance on where to go from here  And also probably help you talk to your parents about your religious beliefs if you ever wanted to Great advice I've had issues with flaky friends in the past  especially when it came to birthday parties of mine  I always feel like shit if I have to bail last minute on plans so I really try not to do it to other people  Last year  for example  I organised a 21st birthday dinner for myself and organised it a month in advance  only to have 6 "friends" bail last minute  It really upset me and now I have a very low tolerance for flaking  I have a three strikes policy now  I understand that it's not always possible to attend events but have the decency to give the host sufficient notice that you're not coming  And if you say you're going to attend an event  suck it up and commit  It's not hard  Maybe they don't add much to the conversation when you're around  Do you really think invites are handed out for no reason at all  Just to spite the people who "deserve" the invites  Don't let ego and cognitive dissonance distract you from reality  If you aren't invited it means they have no reason to invite you  And it isn't unfair  would you invite a random person for no reason  Maybe if you were desperate and wanted as many people attending as possible  but for the most part  well I'm sure you know the answer I broke up with my gf of a years 2 weeks ago  It's hard  But you're stronger than thisI can imagine people would be less willing to be around someone unattractive but unattractive people can still have friends  Do people avoid because of what you say  Also I find it silly that people give the "17 is too young to be FA" when most people here are only 20       12 15 year olds  I would still view this as an accomplishment plus being smart enough and having enough to put on a resume to get accepted to a good school Bipolar disorder needs medication like diabetes needs insulin   Stop putting pressure on yourself where there doesn't need to be   There are many medications that do not make you feel like a zombie  That will help you care for your child by being the best version of yourself  Avoiding something that can help ease your pain and give you a step up is not a strength  it's a stubbornness that needs to end now   You cannot see clearly right now  please use anything you can to help shift the axis of your world again so you can end up on top   Source  Bipolar mother  went back on meds when my son was 5 months old  If you don't allow yourself to feel bad once in awhile it piles up until it gets to be too much to handle  Happy you are feeling better after talking it out  Best wishes for the new year  I feel as if you should distract him from the thought of the girl  Do you guys have a friend group that can take him out to eat or have a good time or something  If so  be supportive and do that for him  Take him out for some food or the arcade or something  If you live in the city  bring him to fun spots  If you know him well enough  you should be able to lift his spirit  And speak to him  Definitely keep talking to him  If he doesn't want your company  be persistent and give him the company he needs  Take the bottle away from him  Tell you how you feel about the alcohol  Tell him the dangers  Persuade him to stop drinking  Even lying about a situation is easy  Create a scenario about a friend who died after something so stupid like this  Tell him there are more fish in the sea and that the perfect one is soon to bite his tackle  Tell him that it takes time  You're an atom bumping into random other atoms and one day you'll be attracted to one idk something like that  But anyways good luck  My advice is vague ish and sorta like what anyone else would say but yea this is what i got sorry if it sucks    good luck its not a huge deal to not go  being a weding guest means you are obliged to buy a gift  generally speaking   and it's expensive for whoever's paying for the wedding to pay for each guest who plans to attend  so i say you might as well save yourself and the bride  whoever's paying for the wedding some money  in the end  the couple should spend their wedding day with the people who truly wanna be there  its ok if you dont  and that doesnt mean that your friendship will end  not every friend goes to every wedding stop trying to be friends with your exIf you don't support yourself while in Florida  ie  you work part time or parents still support you  then you won't qualify for residency in Florida  You also have to establish residency in Florida for at least a year prior to starting school to qualify for in state tuition  PM me for more info if needed  I went through the same dilemma myself last year It's my destiny Hold on  don't listen to this  While it's with good meaning that is NOT sound business advice   Hire a firm to find a replacement CEO  Move out of the operations roles   If you haven't already read "the 4 hour work week"  The loneliness thing will not go away by becoming poor  you actually skipped ahead in time by becoming successful   Go to college and meet cool people and date   Stop opening new businesses  you're not ready to develop your investment group yet  That will be for the next stage when you're refreshed and ready Who let the normies in  he just put me on unemployment and told me if i wanted to keep working on some web stuff  i said yea but never really returnedClearly  somebody pissed on your pants I think that you were perhaps too hasty when seeking help  Though it's a good attitude since you were trying to help  you exposed C in a way she  he probably didn't feel comfortable with  Hence the backstabber  C might have felt that she he couldn't trust you anymore or that you should have at least tried to talk to her him first  By the end of it she  he realized she  he didn't mean it since she sensed you only cared for her him  And you ignored that  For a whole year  If you do talk to her  him apologize and make sure that when she   he needs you again you will be there for him   her and won't bail like this time   That being said  u Sabstis Egroge explained very well C's perspective  Please understand how C felt before talking to him herBingo  this is a sound solution  Even if it takes 2 3 people hired to handle all those things it's important that he as the owner take himself out of the functional role and simply start looking at 1 4 financial reports and CEO board briefings How did this turn out I think it might be normal  If you jack it enough  maybe twice a day  I'm sure it will start to feel a bit sore  Probably nothing a doctor could do except for give you some ointment  which will just make it feel like he splurged anyways  The best thing OP can do is just wait a few days in between jacking it  but it doesn't seem to be his decision   Why would he want to get a job   He should hire a CEO and retire to 1 4 reports from the CEO board    why would he throw the business away if it's not at capacity I got strep throat multiple times per year starting around age 14   My dad refused to have them taken out   After age 19  I never got another strep throat infection again   36 years later  no infections   All these people stating they had it done and all problems stop missed the part in the article that said problems usually stop on their own   i think you should just ask him about what you have observed if he has been a friend this long you should be able to talk things out and get to the bottom of your concerns w o causing a scene  if afterwards you feel like he is dodging questions of generally acting suspicious then maybe talk to someone else about it    i say this as a long time friend of his dont immediately jump to conclusion that he's doing something wrong  maybe with his upbringing and sexual orientation he is simply trying to reach out to a younger crowd to give anyone a brotherly figure or someone to talk to if he senses they might be struggling with a problem    you only gave 1 example of something bad happening and even that could fall on the younger person freaking out that he was gay when he told him and have nothing to do with anything they did together    given the seriousness of going to any authoritative figure and suggesting someone is exhibiting pedophile like traits is not something they can come back from if its not true they will always then be labeled it by someone especially if that person told starts to tell everyone they know w o knowing if it is actually true or not im not well versed in the world of business or finance  but i will say that most employers will not ask you what your gpa was  or even what your major was  generally speaking   if you dont want to go to graduate school  then your gpa wont seriously hurt you in most cases    now  if you want to get an advanced degree after your bachelors  then you might want to try and increase your GPA  its normal for graduate schools to have a cut off for competitive GPAs  normally bw 3 0 3 5 minimum  ways to increase GPA  take easier classes  spend your summers taking courses that you know youll succeed in at a community college  and just the old fashioned study study study    also   a healthty mental state is so helpful when it comes to school performance  maintaining a healthy state for yourself is the most important  more important than your GPA or your major    good luck Well  there you go   Unless you want to care more  And that's what's making you unhappy  Then   again   might be good to talk to someone  Heck  if you're not happy  maybe as another poster wrote  open up to your mom about the real reasons  Or to someone  I was alone   and it would have seeped through into my underwear right  not healthy  It keeps me from going insaneFirst step is time  I feel like this one topic isn't stressed enough  Allow time to rekindle your passion and interest  One day you might just walk around and see something you like and start thinking really hard about it  And from there you might develop an interest in the thing you saw    I'm sure you listen to music right  Hey  Explore some different genres of music on Pandora  Or use spotify it sure helped me when I was trying to chill    I have many hobbies such as playing the guitar  singing  piano  basketball  golf  gaming  and many others I can't think off the top of my head rn  BUT pick something up    Go for that instrument that you always wanted to learn or just purchase an instrument  Or go to a local guitar center or instrument store and chill there    Hey and eating always solves anything  BTW it's kinda sounding like these tips are for chilling which most of them are    OR YOU CAN SMOKE WEED AND OR DRINK BUT BOTH ARE DANGEROUS NOT ADVISING YOU TO DO THAT BUT I MEAN HEY IF IT HELPS IT HELPS   I suggest you take a walk  And think while drinking your favorite beverage or eating your favorite food  Or spend time with friends and try and find the passion in them  Ask them for advice    Sorry if these tips don't work but I tried   Good luck  fly to vancouver bc canada and come visitDude  it's crazy stressful in a way most people don't understand   Imagine you're the only person on earth that can treat cancer and you're making insane money but every time you look out the the line of patients only is getting longer and longer by the day   Do you stop  Or do you keep going   It's a double edge sword  let down customers or let down yourself  Meanwhile the correct answer is neither  hire someone  or multiple  to replace you You should definitely try out meditation as some people say that it works wonders   Another thing to try  while it's obviously easier said than done  is to just slow down and worry about what's going on now   Don't worry about what will happen in the future or expect yourself to be perfect in any way   No one has everything figured out  so if you just relax and try your hardest in whatever aspect this anxiety is coming  hopefully it will subside a bit You took off your pants and got into bed  You woke up in the middle of the night to piss  and you decided to piss onto your pants  The pants soaked up the urine  leaving the floor dry Thank you so much  I appreciate the kind words and I will take you up on that pm offer sooner than later  My mom went to Costa Rica to retrieve him so we can move forward and I am watching my siblings  I know he is watching me  i will keep you updated with what is going on  One would think   The plot thickens   Good luck   You might not like the answers you find   This does sound like mild depression  which can be a symptom of things like Seasonal Affective disorder  a very common condition that a lot of people have   You just need to learn some coping skills  which you can research for yourself online   Whether it's SAD or something else  lots of people have mild depressive episodes that they are able to resolve without a psychiatrist or medication   Just get some coping skills   Maybe see your school counselor if you can't figure out any coping skills on your own You are all in my thoughts and I appreciate the support  Trying to figure out where to go from here  Please report it  It's literally a crime that was committed   And when you report it  they will likely be able to point you in the direction of some resources to help you deal with the emotions you're having now  which are totally understandable  Einstein was missing a piece of his brain It will  It will get easier  First mama you need to do some self care  You are ok  You will get better  It's hard right now   but  it willl  Get  Better  I have a few diagnosiss  so if you ever need to talk  Iim here I never really got a reason My exgf's parents reacted just like yours when she told them she was bisexual   I remember once when we were visiting her parents her Mom said something like "you should be worried that no man is going to want you when they find out you've been with women "  I was sitting right next to her at the time all    you know    being a man and wanting her   I don't get it man not exactly because I live in florida during college and I also am moving there after I get my bachelors for grad school   This girl sounds so messed up   You stick your duck in crazy   She's very unstable and if you express your anger towards her uncle you'll just be sucked further down her black hole of insanity   If I were you I'd find an anger management support group  to help you get past the way you treated her and the way you feel about her uncle   You and her  both  need emotional help  but you need to worry only about yourself As a rule  yeah  All it does is escalate the situation and drag you down to their level  It's also likely you'll lose the respect of anyone who witnesses it  Even if you were in the right  somebody who immediately stoops to insulting you isn't going to understand that whether you insult them back or not  but they'll know they got to you and feel like they "won"  It's best to disengage as much as possible and move on to something else  Insulting people and generally being nasty is toxic  eventually it starts getting to you  how you feel about yourself and how you interact with other people    Edit  The exception to this would be playful situations with people who are okay with it being a part of your relationship  For example  me and my best friend regularly roast each other  but never during an argument or serious conversations  We are also careful to respect each other's boundaries because we don't ever want to hurt each other  and always apologize immediately if we do so accidentally  Unfortunately things like that do happen and I know how it feels to kind of watch it fizzle out   I think the biggest problem though  just from reading your post  is that it seems to me like you were so comfortable in this relationship that you didn't really try to go out and find other meaningful friendships   People do change over time and you may never know why she's pulling away   It may not even be something that you did   It's really important though to try to go out and do things that you want to do  like pursuing hobbies  sports  etc  and meeting people along the way   Not every person is going to become a great friend  but the more people you meet the higher the chance that you'll find someone you connect with   Remember too that no friendship is going to start out exactly at the level you are with this friend now   It takes time to build and so try not to compare people to her and possibly drop them because the relationship doesn't feel as strong right away   Best of luck to you and stay strong   I know it must be hard I try to get out once in a while  and lately it seems that I've been seeing a lot of people on tinder dates in the coffee shops  Dudes pretty much better looking than me  with chicks I could see myself dating  I try not to let it get me down  but it's difficult I know im trying to get residency for the remainder 2 years and for grad school and I plan on living there for grad school That's awesome  Although I'm wondering why you're including mexican foods in there  Maybe some Americanized Mexican foods are bad but traditional food is generally very healthy  Probably most important is all the fiber you're getting from beans  and then lots of fruits and veg like tomatoes  chilies  avocado  cilantro  onion  Tortillas are better for you than white bread  more fiber   Same with tortilla chips and potato chips  Dessert or appetizers can very often be a fruit like cantaloupe or mango OP  just today I posted in this very Sub about my experiences with my pedophile  family abusing father  Though that wasn't actually the end of my story  I can relate to yours as my mom is also choosing to stay by his side  She didn't know before I outed him  so I'm sorry to hear that your mom has made even worse choices that carried serious consequences    Of course your story isn't one you want to tell  and therefore others will not understand why you're walking around looking like a mannequin    I made the mistake of explaining to a coworker what had happened  and the sympathy I received was very unwelcome  It may seem like it'd be great for others to feel for your case  but I can say with confidence it won't make you feel any better  For starters  if they thought he was just dead you'd be forced to hear people saying all sorts of nice and wonderful things about a person who deserves no sort of thoughts  If they knew the true story you'd have blurry faces trying to connect  to try and empathize where they have no business or true understanding to do so    I'm only a month out from the discovery and am still spiraling downward  I hope you can find stable ground to land  it'd be nice to know someone in a similar boat didn't drown in misery  like I feel I will    Just get back with her if you love her   She's not suffering if she walked into the relationship knowing you are studying medicine   and usually preoccupied   Canny your local police's non emergency number   They have burglary specialists who can come to your house and look around   They can tell you if this is a typical thief MO or if something unexplainable happened Whos to say I didnt move out of my parents house and attend school in florida while also staying at the family friends house for free on breaks   what would someone in that situation do You should of quit before you took the drug test  That way you don't have to take it and within 6 months be rehired for that company  Since they do drug tests the company you work for may have zero tolerance to drugs policy  You will be fired  and never be eligible to be hired by whatever that company owns  Sorry  and for the parents I doubt they will contact them since you're the employee and not them Therapy   Loss of interest is an early sign of depression   It may get worse  so you should seek help sooner than later Not a smart idea  Opening old wounds won't do much after all this time  From what I can tell you seem to just feel some nostalgia  which will pass  And say a friendship blossoms again  it will only be a matter of time before something like that happens again  It's something that I've seen happen over and over again with people  myself included  and it's never worth it  I would recommend leaving the past in the past  I hope this helpsI know what you mean  Having similar trouble with it myself  While I got to spend the holiday with people that I like  The entire time it felt off  I felt so very distant from everyone and I'm not sure why  I mean even though I was surrounded by people I call my friends I felt alone  It has been an awesome year in terms of getting my life closer to what I want but even though I have been working on improving myself  While I have people I call friends that I care for a great deal  I don't know if I can count on them or if i'm just that weird acquaintance they tolerate being around for whatever reason  I know part of that loneliness comes from not having any sort of significant other or companion close friend in my life  For me growing up New Year's was always another one of those holidays people celebrate the joy of being a couple  the whole kiss your SO and celebrate the start of another year with them thing is something I want  Being perpetually single makes that impossible and mildly depressing   If you can identify what causes the lonely feelings or what triggers you to pull away or disconnect from people you can start figuring out what you need to do to change that  It's not something that will change overnight or maybe even this year but it sounds like you are able to identify some of it so that's something  Best of luck in working through it  I know it can be rough but you can do it  You are not alone For me  it's not something I feel I  need  to do  but it does fall into the category of "cliche" things that I've always wanted to do  That's where most of my anguish about being alone comes from  it's missing out on such seemingly simple things that other people get to celebrate without even having to try I agree  When I was struggling with depression I had a short fuse  I was very irritable and mean for no reason  After some psychiatrist appointments and therapy  I started changing those behaviors  He may just need some help kick starting himself in the right direction   How to go about this  I have no idea  Telling a person in that state that they need help may make them defensive  Just let him know you care about him  and that you've noticed some things that suggest he might be going through something bigger  Suffering depression or going to therapy aren't signs of weakness  Conquering the fears and making the steps to beat it are actually signs of strength in my eyes   There is also a chance he's just a lazy jerk and needs a rude awakening  like my 33 year old alcoholic brother who still lives with his parents   I am so incredibly proud of you   You're a strong person to be doing this and you're a wonderful  amazing mother  You can do this That took me awhile that you meant ACT and not act  The other comments are correct  and I want to emphasize that you should seriously drop the drugs   You're in a bad spot if they're causing you this many problems  let alone causing these problems at 15   Remember though that you're still young   Everyone has gone through what you're going through at one point or another  and you need to keep in mind that you can create positive changes in your life  even if it's just by taking baby steps   It's the new year  so take all of those things you listed that make you unhappy and make a goal to change them or even to get on track to change them   There's a ton of stuff online that you can find on how to change your life  and you just need to put it into action   Best of luck and pm me if you ever need to talk Ugh   weddings  I'm just trying to get to the date Fuck every year Wow  That's sad  I'm sorry    My mother has bipolar disorder  coupled with some anxiety and PTSD  The best thing she ever did for herself and our relationship is agree to go to the hospital  I know it can be scary  especially knowing that the medication can be so trial and error but I think it would be great for you  They can show you more ways of coping and help to get you stable  there is a bipolar subreddit that I follow as well that may give you some encouragement that you need  Best of luck with your treatment  3  Edit  It's r bipolar  not sure why I didn't link it before meetups  my friend moved to a new city after college and she has met people thru meetups on facebook  there are so many groups out there who meet up weekly    also you can find people who

like shitI've seen a lot of people on dating sites that claim they are in school  constantly traveling  2 jobs  etc   I do wonder how they think they could manage a relationship While "tough love" isn't banned  using it on someone who is potentially suicidal can actually get you banned  Honestly  I don't care how qualified these people are either  because I've talked to multiple therapists who were extremely qualified yet had no idea about the first thing when it came to FA  I gave my last therapist  300 over a few sessions and all I got was "tough love" when he told me to "stop going on the internet  then start going out to meet people " When I told him I tried for years and still failed he said "it's because you were going on the internet which is causing you to be negative so people don't want to talk to you" which is complete bullshit  In order for there to be "tough love" there has to be "love" as someone below said  How can a stranger you have never talked to before "love" you  They obviously can't  so that isn't "tough love"  it's just being a dick  I don't care how much money the person makes helping people  We have no idea how to verify anything on here  and that approach has failed every single time someone has tried to use it on here  They get mad and say it's because we didn't want to change but in reality  it's because they never actually gave a shit about us  They just wanted to feel better about themselves instead of helping us feel better about ourselves which the goal should be for the sleep issue  you can try not looking at screens for at least an hour before you plan tk sleep  that might help you fall asleep faster  False dichotomy      Learning is good   but also     I'll take your lottery win on your behalf then    They are pointless  It's just a way to waste time when sitting in waiting rooms Very important wisdom That's also really spot on  I felt distant from my mother because we were having some misunderstandings in communication but we talked it out so I feel better about that  But I also felt very distant from some of my close friends  It's hard to pinpoint exactly but it's pretty much what you said  I felt really insecure and like they were just being nice to me and didn't think very much of me  It's odd that we both were feeling that  I don't know know why New Year's brings that out more   I know that I need to figure that out and the answer isn't to pull away more  But I don't really know how to put my insecurities at ease or talk to them about that without seeming needy or embarrassing   Thank you because your comments are more helpful than you might think  I hope you are feeling better and have a great year Yes it sounds internal    It might be your ego playing you    by feeling less than him  Just remember everyone is different and we all got our strengths and weakness The hideous suffering stopped after my tonsils were removed   No more painful sore throat  fever  pain with swallowing  headache  horrible feeling of unwell  etc   The worst pain was the anguish in my mother's eye every time I suffered the symptoms of tonsillitis I have felt the same many times myself and I would find something that you've enjoyed and explore it  If you want to do something cool in your life you have to work for it  I really want to travel and be able to hear stories from people everywhere so I put effort into learning new languages  Find a way to make progress every day  if that means lifting or learning a new word or drawing a new animal  If you watch the office  you have to find your acapella group  Also if your friend makes you happy than you should invest as much time as possible improving your relationship because you want to have a release  Don't sink because you gave upThis sounds really sappy i knowUgh  I'm sorry  I see this all the time  People that want to date  but not really  Or people who are "just looking for whatever"  Such a waste of time and effort  I made myself get up for work at the same time as my boyfriend  7 30am   I had to apply to at least one job have at least one appointment for an interview  clean at least one part of the house  do any other chores for the day  laundry  empty dishwasher  etc   and have coffee or breakfast before I could turn on the TV  Helped make the days go quicker and helped my sanity  After around lunch I could veg a little if I wanted  but I work in the marijuana industry in denver so I needed to just not spend my days getting stoned Go on another date and hand him the condom u nutted in This post has been

financing  but if its not a financial burden for you to drop out and study something else that interests you more than law  somewhere closer to your home  then you should probably look into that   but if you are gonna drop out  you should have at least some sort of a plan for yourself  whether it be to find a job back home or to start applying to different schoolsAs someone who has struggled with suicidal thoughts depression for a while  I can understand the regret of lashing out at the people closest to you when they really just wanted to help    That being said  I made amends with my close friends that I hurt really badly and we're fine now  but you can't really tell if C has genuinely gotten better and changed as a person  I think a heart to heart with them would be a good thing for both of you  for you to settle the dust and see if being friends again is a good idea  and for C to understand your worries about being friends again    Maybe you don't have to be the closest of friends again  but having some kind of relationship would be okay  Good luck op x Ur capslock r oddlysatisfyingWhat is the alternative  You can also try taking a melatonin supplement about 1 hour before you want to sleep  not look at screens  do some reason  maybe school related  to help you get tired    For school work  it's all will power  You either convince yourself that your future is important and you need to do it  or you don't do it and you fail  so maybe make a list with due dates in the order of importance or whatever and just keep knocking stuff off the list  I'm so sorry  Bad things happen to good people and I want to kick the shit out of that guy  If you need someone to talk to you can message me  3First off don't worry about sounding conceited or anything like that   Everyone has problems and yours are just as legitimate   Also please don't hurt yourself in any way   It isn't worth it   Unfortunately  the hard truth is that it's going to be so hard just because you're 17   You're still young and you're going to make mistakes   People will probably be playing games in terms of dating and not being straightforward with each other   The only thing I can say is that what you need to do to separate yourself from everyone else your age is to accept responsibility for your mistakes and learn from them   Hopefully this doesn't sound too harsh  but from this you can learn and change a few things   The first is to limit your alcohol intake at parties because now you know what can happen if you don't   The second thing is to start studying because  though I hate to say it  school should be a priority   It can also help to take your mind off of everything   The last thing is to  at least in my opinion  message her a bit differently   Right off the bat I'll admit that this is just my opinion and it may be wrong because I don't know her  but I think you should maturely own up to what happened   I'm not saying that your message was this immature  but imagine if the situation had been reversed and she sent a message to you the next day of "lol I drank so much last night right " vs  something more serious and mature like "Could we speak about what happened last night  I made a mistake and went overboard but it seems like there's tension between us now and I'd like to make it right "  Again those aren't the exact words but hopefully you get what I mean   Overall though try not to worry too much about it   I promise you'll find another girl if this doesn't work out and you should try your best to forgive yourself for an honest mistake   Best of luck and pm me if you need to talk more Ignore her  she likes to look for attention  The amount of people she has ghosted after crying for attention on r r4r and r foreveralonedating is insane  I'm definitely not the only one and have seen numerous guys post the exact same thing in her previous dating posts that she has now deleted  I sent a well thought out message sympathizing with her and relating to her from my own life experiences  she replied with a decent enough message saying she wanted to chat then boom  ghosted  Next thing I know she is coming on here posting for attention and pasting her tits all over the internet   Poor thing is so alone guys  It's not hard to spot an attention  seeker  they will say things like    I try so hard to find a significant other but I refuse to settle for just anyone   The problem isn't the other person  it's you wasting people's time so you can look for attention   Salty rant over   Edit  Big fucking surprise  she deleted it  This girl is a fucking parasite I downloaded like 20 gay dating apps   lol  I'm gonna sign up and pay for match com as I would hope the people there might be more serious about actually dating   I'm also going to as many meetup com groups as I can and try to start my own for adult fans of Lego  I'm in a social anxiety group  and it's been helping me   Finally  being more serious about losing weight   only 15 more lbs to go  by eating less junk yes but i was wondering if i also had to pay my own florida taxes as an independent or would I have no taxes since I am not paying rent or paying to live in the houseGo do it  It's nice to feel financially secure  One less thing to worry about  Just live within your means and retire as early as you can    you need to be 100  honest with both your parents and your doctor  you obviously know something isn't right  and unfortunately these issues don't usually sort themselves out  take it from me  get help sooner rather than later  you don't realize what you've got till it's gone   I'd rather just let it be known how I feel right now   Well  how  do  you feel right now  You could just send a message for closure  and say  "Hey  I just realised I'd missed your past messages  Just wanted you to know  no hard feelings and I hope you are doing well  Take care " or whatever makes sense to you just finish out the degree then go to massage therapy school after   even if the degree is meaningless to your current career aspirations  you never know where life will lead you  a college degree will help you in lots of scenarios  from getting a job to getting a specialized degree    one more semester   psh you got thisThe thing is  I can't be honest   I'm having a brief period of lucidity where I know I'm acting crazy but I can feel my paranoia on the edge of my mind   It's almost tangible and I can't say it out loud   I can type it here  where my family won't see because if they know what I think and I'm right it will be really  really bad   This is already really bad The only thing you can do is to remember that life is happening all around us and to every single person  and that you can't do anything about it   I know that sounds kind of depressing but it's true   You played absolutely no part in a relative dying  and it was going to happen anyway  as it will to everyone who's ever lived and will live    You also can't stop the fact that people change as they age and sometimes people just grow apart   There's nothing you can do about it except to part on good terms and wish them all the best   Also try to remember that what's done is done  and while you can't go back and fix things  you can try to make sure they don't get any worse  in regards to the hurt feelings of the friendship    You should feel guilty if your actions are purposely malicious and if you want to hurt someone  but from your post that clearly isn't true   There's no "right" way to end a friendship  and it's always better to be honest than to string someone along   Just keep trying to be the best person you can be and remember that that's all you can do   Best of luck and pm me if you ever need to talk more Yeah  Valuable to who   Really  I had no idea you could do that  Thank you so much Yes  Your second paragraph  If I had a nickle for every time my kids said I was mean I would be filthy rich   It's starts about age three  I am looking at my three year old son right now haha    I tell him to take his clothes upstairs or put his paw patrol toys away and he doesn't want to    So I follow through with put them away or lose them  temporary   He stomps his feet and says he doesn't like me  I say "Ok "  He does what I ask him and he comes down for dinner or just completed the task  I tell him thank you for doing that   He smiles  I try to make sure I catch him at a good moment soon after he tells me I am mean because he is mad  So I can talk him how much I love him    There is no sense at all to make this a big deal   You can just say  that is not nice either  that would hurt moms feelings    Good night  And just continue on like no big deal    Every time I go out I feel like everyone is staring at me and it makes me feel crowded and causes me to feel panicky and sweat  Therefor I try to avoid it like my life depends on it No matter how complete you may feel alone  most of us have that hardwired craving to be touched  loved  have sex  etc  Without that for so many years  it does start to feel like something is missing Im proud of you       As someone who got a 31  i understand not wanting to gloat  The highest my friends got was a 26 it's only going to get worse  don't let yourself get into that position  it fucking sucks  trust me  get yourself sorted and move on in life  don't slowly drown like i have  Sorry as I am not familiar with housing in the UK just wanted to say congrats on your positive attitude about moving forward for now    just keep in mind that your undergraduate major will most likely not affect your life outside of your time in college  unless you want to be an accountant or an engineer or a doctor or something specific along those lines  you can study anything and have the same life   also  i studied something completely unrelated to my future career  and it hasnt hindered me at all  i am going to grad school for a science based profession  and i studied drama in college    worst case scenario  you'll want to go to a graduate school down the line and you'll need classes that you didnt take in college  so what  you just take them at a community college  no biggie   if you dont see more schooling in your future  then you dont need to stress about what you study  enjoy being a student To yourself  I guess  Do you love yourself  I'm about to go love myself a couple of times before bed "But I'll always be your friend   "I'm going to link you to a specific episode of a podcast   It's a storytelling podcast   and in it a young woman talks about going through a mental health

Sitting at home certainly makes it worse  but going out in public can be a reminder of loneliness too  It's a whole bag of mixed emotions Heads up  most people here are not going to be sympathetic  because you were married once  regardless of how it ended  You just are not forever alone  and saddling yourself with that label is only holding you back if you're as cute as you say  Read the

saying this  Lately I've flipping between an actual physical pain in my heart of sadness and crying  then flipping to an intense  internal rage at the unfairness of it all and seeing happy couples  everywhere  shitpost much My advice would be to schedule some informational interviews with people in the field you want to work in and see what they did   I have heard having a degree helps  but I have also heard that it isn't really necessary  so it seems to swing both ways  Look  I understand how you feel  I attempted suicide 5 or 6 times when I was 14  I was going through homelessness  living with family I barely knew  family making me feel like shit because I came out as bi  and other things I don't feel like bringing up  I almost died the last time and was institutionalized  After I got over my muck I felt horrible   And like you  fear that I could actually have died is what kept me going  I also struggled with severe depression and anxiety  now controlled but thats another story for another day   You feel guilty and scared as hell  but you learn to manage  You can't undo what you did but you learn from it  I learned that had I died  I admittedly wouldn't have gone through some of the absolute hell I had  But I also wouldn't have gone through some amazing things  met amazing people  and got father in life than I thought at 14    All you can do is move on and carry yourself forward  Learn from the person who hurt you and learn from what you've done  Lifes a messed up educational game  You learn  you fall  you fuck up  you get back up  you dust yourself off  and you move on and repeat and the next time you fall you get back up sooner and smoother   I might not be the best person to give advice but I went through a period where death was what I desired most and I learned from it  I still fall now but it's more of a stumble and I still got plenty of years to go   And if it's of any matter  I'm 19 too  Ya I wasn't thinking straight  kind of panicked at work  As I was clicking out to leave my manager pulled me aside saying I had to get tested  Would have been extremely awkward and suspicious to quit on the spot there but nothing I can do about it now Might as well delete your reddit account as well Thank you  I think the reason single dad's are praised more than single mom's is because more men have fled responsibility than women  So  single mom's are more common and than single dad's  That doesn't make it right but  it is the primary reason  I believe  I hope my post inspires those who are able to make those changes within their own communities   but what if you didnt have a job and all you did was stay with the family friend and go to college there  would i be paying any extra   Oh shit you became the annoying friend in this post  making it about yourself  Haha jk jk  Op it takes a lot of guts to break off a toxic friendship  props to you I guess he didn't live up to his username    lol ask somewhere else  no one here knows shit about datingI have different strategies depending on the emotions and on what is feasible at the time   Strategy 1  if I'm feeling emotional  but can't leave work right at that moment  I find something to focus on  For instance  get some hot tea  It's not only a distraction  but comforting too  Focus on the flavor  on the temperature  on the feel of the cup  Just something to pull you out of your head  Something else that you can try is if you have some work that you need to do which is fun and engaging tell yourself that you are just going to work on it for 10 minutes  even if you really don't feel like it  After 10 minutes  give yourself another 10 minute goal  and so on  Again  it's something to get you out of your head and let the feelings dissipate   Strategy 2   go for a walk  If I can leave work for a bit  and if strategy 1 doesn't work  it helps to get outside  It clears my mind a little by getting into a new setting   Of course walking also gives me time to ruminate on my feelings which can make things worse  So I give myself the first 10 minutes of the walk to ruminate analyze cry whatever  Sometimes I feel better after that 10 minutes  but if not  then I mentally push the situation away  I picture it in my head and imaging a curtain coming across  covering whatever the issue is   I've heard of other people locking their feelings in a box or putting them on a shelf  the curtain thing just seems to come more natural to me  I then use the rest of the walk to focus on the plants  on cars passing by  details of buildings anything to distract  I also think about what fun thing I'm going to do when I get home  Gets me thinking about the future rather than the past  Then when I get home I allow my self to revisit the issue  and do whatever fun thing I had planned   Usually by this time I'm less emotional and can analyze the situation rationally   Strategy 3  again you need to be able to leave work  I treat myself to a nice lunch  I also like to crank the music up while I'm driving and singalong  It's hard to feel sad or anxious when you're singing at the top of your lungs   Strategy 4  works when angry  I run  sprint  as far and fast as a can until it feels like my legs are going to give out  I don't run often so this doesn't take long  and then I force myself to keep running at a slower pace  Basically  it's hard to feel too bad when the endorphins are flowing and you are physically exhausted   So in short  exercise and distraction are the methods that I use  Good luck  I hope that you find a strategy that works for you Self discipline is hard  Before starting a project  pump the brakes and outline all the steps  Write down a timeline and steps  No matter what you do you won't commit to change unless you want it  You have to want bad energy ugh to change your lifestyle  What usually happens to make you lose interest I appreciate the reply TomorrowWendy  but I'd be seriously remiss to call myself a hero    I'd agree that being courageous  at first  disrespecting Andrew was hands down the most disgusting thing I've ever done  puts you at odds with the world though  There was reluctance by both my brothers and their respective wives to take the leap  We recognized there would be consequences  I knew I would be blamed for the situation  that I would take some serious heat for blowing the whistle  and I did    What I didn't expect was for Amy to come on to me  That came at a time when I was weak  nearly a shell of my former self  It doesn't make up for the fact I didn't stop her and reciprocated  that my own needs trumped my families well being even if just temporarily  To say I made a mistake is a colossal understatement    I'm not sure how common my gaffe is  Of course instances of infidelity are a dime a dozen  but for it to be my own brother that I cheat  I wish I could say it's possible to understand  but I don't think so  I loved him so much  I would have given everything to him if he asked  How I could lose sight of that is unforgivable    I'm still very scared of what lay ahead  I haven't been able to shake the feelings of self hatred and zero self worth  I have realized however that doing anything without first making amends with Andrew isn't right  Amy and I lied right to his face  at least one person has to look him in the eye and tell the honest truth    If it were that easy for her to act out with her brother in law what would stop her from doing it again  He has to know that this wasn't me being predatory  that there were two performers in this act  He has to know that his wife of only 6 months can't be trusted  just the same way he can't trust me  I'm not looking for revenge on her  just for accountability   I'll make it through this  only because time doesn't stand still  Life goes on  reluctant or disconnected as we may be  Reality is that the life I had is gone  nothing I will know will be anything like what I knew  Whether that is something I can adjust to or not is another ball game  probably for a therapist and I to play    I do appreciate the kind words Wendy  it means a lot to have someone at least try to understand me   50 in 07Don't forget showering I get where you're coming from  but this really isn't the sub for you First of all Thank you for your answer I really apreciate that   No I am not going into debt since all universities are basicly free  in Germany but life in general is quite expensive  Rent  food  etc   luckily my parents support me   Well probably I will apply for a few different courses starting autum this year in order to be free to choose when time comes   You didnt mention it explicitly but I assume that you think that I should look into Moving Back  am I right I adopted an eight year old rat terrier who is now fifteen and is the perfect apartment dog  Very loving and affectionate couch potato  Im so sorry  You can message me if you want  My boyfriend went through something almost exactly like that    Its ok to feel sad  Pissed  All those things you feel  But  YOU ARE NOT WORTHLESS  You survived  Those types of people are sick  sick  sick  and are incredibly cowardly to do those things  You have done absolutely nothing wrong  You are a wonderful and complex person  and are so much more than that terrible experience    Much love Totally relate  I'm 32 and went to my brother's wedding recently  All the attendees were couples or married already  I was a groomsman  and although the ceremony was "cute"  I had to fight tears    Not because of the sentiment of the wedding  but of going back to my empty  cold hotel room for 3 nights   And what's with the public proposal shit  I would want to do that in private if it were me  It's an emotional time between two people   the whole fucking restaurant and family doesn't need to see it  putting pressure on the person to say "yes"  People need a little more modesty with their PDA I'm an engineer  not that smart but hard to replace so they keep me aroundWhat you may actually be attempting to describe is probably arrogance or stubborness There is no actual such thing  or attitude  which may properly be termed as "over confidence"  The two actually appropriate terms to may be "arrogant" or stubborn"   The term "over confident" seems to suggest that a person has  too much   confidence   However  people who are arrogant  or stubborn  are people coping  or over compensating  for personal insecurities  Stubbornness is not the same persistence  Stubbornness is rather self detrimental  Persistence is a constructive quality or a "good" quality"   I suppose that the question to answer is  Are you intimidated by her confidence  or is she essentially an arrogant or stubborn person  If so  what is the cause or reason for that Talk to a therapist about your rights  The drop thing is rediculous  Academic probation  Its high school  for christs sake    Edit  fellow adhderdo it Thank you so much for sharing I am willing to try and anything and will definetely go for it  That's sweet of youIf you don't smoke at all you could volunteer for blood test for nicotine Education is important tbhBit hard to give advice without knowing much about you but I would say try to do things you enjoy and be confident about being yourself and don't worry about what others may think  I know its easier said than done but this will hopeful put you around people with similar interests and being open and confident with yourself will draw people to you who are similar to you  Hope this helpsBecause as human males we sometimes need the acceptance or love from woman to feel human   When I have an episode like the one I described it does impact me as I do get rather violently ill  Can you tell me about this         Also  do you feel that you go with the flow  or you are a bit of a perfectionist         Lastly  what about the 'after I'm dead' disturbs you the most Well  take it easy on yourself because this is all pretty new and a lot for anyone to digest  It's possible your folks said their words in the heat of the moment and maybe they'll feel differently with some time passing  That said  you're going to have to live in day tight compartments for the foreseeable future  as looking too far ahead has become a source of much anguish for you  Focus on taking each day as it comes and this whole scenario will be a lot easier to deal with  Your love for your parents shines through in your post here  Good luck and don't be so hard on yourself  Life has a way of working itself out Ok so when this all happened I didn't get a chance myself to get the guys insurance  The cop at the scene got it for me  On the police report the officer put that the guy presented valid insurance  But when I called they guys insurance they said his police had been expired since January  I have his address and all info over him on the police report  Me too  It's the FA  When I have gone on a date in the distant past or have a prospect  my whole world lights up  I get chores and hobbies done and feel energetic and peaceful  It's a good feeling to feel romantically sexually desired   When there's no dates to look forward to  who's gonna care if my house is unvacuumed for 2 weeks  my projects aren't started  or I'm eating frozen pizzas every night  No one  Instead  my time is spent in bed  surfing online  and not getting shit done Dam i live in RDP wish I saw this sooner   haha yes if youre not setting yourself up for wasted debt  which i now know youre not doing   then for sure i would move home if i were in your position  theres no compelling reason to stay where you are  I had that surgery as a teen and remember having the same concern  Just go Here is a secret about adults and everyone else in your life  No matter your age you never feel like an adult  Confidence and certainty never just one day happen  Everyone is unsure of themselves and no one really knows what they are doing  We are all just faking it till we make it  Confidence is built when you focus on gaining experiences  You become confident in something by experiencing something  Anxiety comes from behind hit afraid of the unknown  If you are worried about how your actions are perceived by others  it's because you are considering doing something saying something that you feel is out of character or new  It something you need to do to be comfortable doing it  Try and think about something that makes you nervous or just try something new every week  Go somewhere you've never been do something you've never do  The first steps are the hardest  but what have you got to lose   I read posts at  r  howtonotgiveafuck sometimes for inspiration about getting over what other people think of you Hang in there OP  opportunities are comingSeek that therapy  She needs to talk to someone  Maybe she has some sort of compulsion disorder that's coming out this way  Whatever it is  it isn't right  She needs to see someone to make sure it's not medical  This is some seriously toxic shit and something that you probably will not be able to deal with all on your own  There also may be options out there to help make any treatment affordable or free  You'll just have to check in your area  Good luck  I really hope things get better for you guys How  you  doin' I'd actually put it at an equal probability of me winning the lottery and me getting into a relationship  If I win the lottery and become a millionare  I'm sure a girl would lie about liking me to be with my money Humor shares a common ground and culture  If there is not much common ground  very few jokes will be enjoyed  Similarly you wouldn't find the jokes the pc people around you make funny Good for you  I know what you mean about the bragging thing   Glad you could tell us   So proud for you     Now just prepare yourself for the mountain of mail you'll now be getting from colleges   There are a lot of things people say to this kind of thing that don't seem like they make a difference to me    "Please don't" "Things will get better" "Imagine everything you'll miss out on" "Think about your loved ones"  Trying to find the right thing to say is a lot harder  I certainly don't know what that right thing is  But I can say  reddit can be a great place to find support when you're all alone  I hope you don't follow through with your plan  I hope that you find peace in this crazy dark world  I hope that you do more than simply live  that happiness and love find their way to you    I will be keeping you in my thoughts  and sending good vibes to the universe for you  When it is too hard to hope that things get better or believe that they will on your own behalf  know that there is someone else out there hoping and believing that for you thanks  The alternative is probably not feeding the trolls  Downvote  report  move on Walk in tne room  Keep your posture straight  head straight up  Give a culturally appropriate smile when entering  Acknowledge there are others in the room  Good response  You need new friends  r Reno would be a better place to askThis is awesome  You totally have bragging rights  I'm so happy for you I feel you  The human mind is awful sometimes  You just need to remember that these fetishes don't define you in any way and that a lottt of people go through them  When you dont want your one friend to get a girlfriend cuz then you know you'll never see him again True  at least he has someone to call If confidence and certainty never just one day happen  then how did it those couple of days  I felt so good about myself and I didn't let anything bother me  Not to mention one of the days I was at the gym  but only for about 10 minutes at school       Also  Im usually afraid of how my actions are perceived by others because I don't usually act towards adults and such how I act with my close friends  I feel like if I act usual  they will think different of me  and I don't know if that different will be good or bad  I just feel like it's too late to change that much of me  because none of them have seen that side of me  I make offensive jokes while sober Is this a joke Find a super cheap outdoor rug and give it as a late christmas present  while heavily hinting about the toys  while I do agree  there are few that seem so masochistically self destructive as this  I've had the feelings myself at times and honestly I'd rather be into kiddie porn then feel those awful  almost evil  feelings Why Did You Capitalize Every Word In The Title BROOOOOO HOMEGIRLLL Fucking congrats seriously all the hard work and time you put into preparing for this really payed off  I'm really happy for you stranger  Smiles and internet hugs for you dude  Take the upvote if it means anything to ya  D Eitherway good job person  you just took one of the first steps to living the life you envisioned for yourselfYeah  I am working on it  Its just that I have to see this person everyday and I'm sick of her interrogating me about my weekends then bragging about hers  I think she leaves me out just so she can one up me You say you never had any family  does this mean you were raised in the foster care system  If so  it would make sense as to why it sounds like you may have trouble forming attachments  Therapy could be an effective tool for you  Even if I'm wrong a good therapist could really help you in learning and practicing these skills   Good luck  This post has been removed    r Health does not allow images  screenshot and other pictures   If you are looking for help with a health problem

Before you shit on IB  take a look at what the alternative would have been   In your classes  you have a self selected group of keeners that are looking for a more challenging program for their last two years of high school   You've got more engaged peers  and a faster pace of teaching than regular public school class  and no problem kids creating distraction    The program creates an environment where you're surrounded by smart  ambitious people  and then it's up to you to make the most of your time there    Tokyo  It's fun and I really do enjoy my life here    G did get inside  I texted her

med school is based on University GPA  High school is basically ignored  Yeah it's definitely not for everyone but I'm just throwing it out thereI admitted to my big mistake  dealt with the consequences  and worked my butt off to rectify the situation  I live with it  You can't forget  even if you want toI relate a lot to this as well  generally common with an anxious mind I believe    I think this may be helpful when it's irrelevant anxious thoughts that are just rehash of embarrassing insignificant moments  however I find I also tend to worry about an unresolved conflict with a significant other  which for me tends to involves long term potential    so     U wot m8  He has several patents to his nameThis one is Fuck Feelings    is this what you were referring to  http   www

sometimes a little cheerier when I have to force positivity around people    Re  skipping CBT column    I don't know why I didn't think of that to be honest    too much of a goody two shoes rule follower   Thanks I will skip it next time  I know exactly what its like  I'm not so bad now  It may be different for you but I found that it all came down to me being self conscious about myself and not even realizing that i think too much about what people are thinking  I would think too much about what I was saying and get muddled up  I still do in stressful situations   Its not something you can fix overnight but just remember that this happens to everyone at some stage  Just try to relax and be confident with who you really are and what you are doing  You don't need to validate yourself to others  Then you don't have to think about what your saying and it just works   Hope this helps I think it means that radical self acceptance lets people have access to a bigger  more interesting version of their personality when speaking with other people   "go suck on a fanny "Thank you for the suggestion man  happy 2017 to you  Im still thinking about it Is it though    I'm assuming OP is talking about College  I think in general it's overrated So true it hurtsSo what you're saying is you plan to attend college in Florida and live there for most of the year  They will quickly turn you down because the Florida Board of Ed specifically states that they review every person on a case by case basis and won't give you residency because you go to school there  I know this works for others in the Midwest and the East  but Florida is much more strict I really don't know how "unfair" it is though  Yin must have yang   Either way it kills me seeing something I like and fractions of a moment later being hit by the realization of inevitably never achieving Cut her off completely l  When you see her at work make very small talk if any  Try and slowly break away from her  Or you could just jump straight to the point and tell her to leave you alone and block her on social media  I personally would just slowly cut her off so there's no bad blood at work This may not be the sub for you Nobody at a medical school would ever see or care about what you did in 10th grade Method for this   Using the national cohort study from the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service

I'm actually working remotely at the moment so typically have more freedom to try these  but when I get back to the office these disaggregations will be helpful    I love your idea about mindful tea drinking  as well as the mindful walking after you've let out any necessary tears analysis rumination  I will definitely try this  it reminds me a lot of meditation but the tangibility of it makes it sound much more effective    thank you    I also often use the pomodoro strategy to get started but sometimes my emotions still get in the way    but you're right 10 mins doesn't sound too much at all  Maybe I"ll shorten the time      Haha strategy 3 sounds amazing too    I already have a few songs in mind      To be honest I haven't had a good work out in over a year  Another thread I cross posted to also recommended this  so thank you for the reminder    I used to competitively sprint in grade school    might get back to it    Thanks so much  These were some of the most practical and theoretically helpful tips I've read so far  I will definitely be trying some of these     thank you  Tell them  If they don't like it do it anyways  You're not a child anymore and from my understanding they don't support you financially  so it's not like they can stop you  Tell them about the money you'll save  etc Don't try and help a depressed person if you don't know how to handle the situation    Often  people with depression don't want you to tell them to face an issue head on  They just want to get their troubles off their chest as a form of catharthis  It can be draining if you're trying to console him her by saying things like "it always gets better" because no depressed person cares to hear that    I wish you the best with your own problems  Mental health issues suck Hey  no problem    I was a teenager once  too   I'm 24 now I grew up on tough love and as far as my research goes it's a contributor to why I hate myself this much no matter what I do or don't do  That voice is stuck in my head and I don't feel like I'll ever be good enough for     i don't even know what for  what about in highschool Yeah you're right  It sucks too because I went through similar things op went through but its kinda like they didn't want to hear take notice of the advice but rather look for a reason fault in it  Can't say I blame op everyone is different it just kind of saddens frustrates me  Mental heath issues fuckin blow indeed  Thanks for consoling words kind stranger  best of luck with your issues as well friend  No problem  all teenagers need to hear this  They need a reminder that they're not alone  and if they don't think they're normal  great news  NO ONE as a teenager thinks they are  r stopgamingNever been  but have you looked at  r PuertoRicoTravel    r PuertoRico   and or  r travel   I'm sure they can help as well Remember that conversation has too functions  Talking and listening   Ask questions you genuinely want to know or are interested in about this person   Listen and try to remember   People can go on and on about themselves sometimes and they may appreciate that you are taking an interest in them   You can use a situation to have a conversation   Lets say you meet girl in the supermarket and you see the contents in her cart   You can say  "Are you making lasagne   You better save me a plate " with a smile   The both of you can have a quick 1 minute conversation about food or even visiting Italy one day   If you run out of stuff to say and the both of you hit it off  ask for contact info then leave   If she gives it to you  cool  if not  don't worry about it   Don't worry about what to say  but let the situation allow you to have a conversation That's a good idea  thank you I think the stigma here is that couples who don't have children should be able to solve their own money problems if they don't have addictions or crippling debt  I'm sorry you are struggling and have struggled for so long  I hope that your gofundme page gets more donations Yup and it really worksI dunno why  but this made me laugh  Thanks for that Degrees help for sure  but you can get into communications without one  Sometimes it's about who you know  And that's a different issue in itself  What kind of job are you looking to get  If you're looking to work at a news station as  let's say  an editor  then it's a good idea to go shoot and edit your own stuff in your spare time  This is sometimes more powerful than a degree because they want people who can do the job and have proof of that  Figure out what it is you want to do  and start doing it now and get good  Then start searching for jobs    Source  got hired at a medium market news station as a promotions producer at 19  less than a year after graduating high school  still there now  What got me the interview  though  was who I knew  Make friends in the field and it will be much easier to land that interview  It shouldn't be that way but it is  But it's not impossible to make that happen and or get around that  The key is to develop your skills  Because in this industry they care more about seeing what you can do  Anything about communications that you'll learn in school  you can learn online  for free     Good luck  I hope this helps a bit    Edit  also just wanted to say fuck what other people are saying  They don't have it figured out either  You do what makes you happy OP  They won't be the ones paying your bills or living your life TrueThey want you  but with a good body Godspeed and good luck   YOU GOT THIS Because they careSame  I had a single Mom  My Father abandoned me when I was 5 so I only had my Mom and older Sister who would constantly bully me  My Mom said it was out of "tough love" but I still have self esteem issues that I can directly connect to her bullying  I'm sorry I can't "man up" and get over it like that therapist said  Yes  I suppose    lmaocongratsCurrently I'm going to school and when classmates start talking about their relationships I long for sweet death to finally take me can relate to you OP I agree with these people about counseling  but for now  have you made a video  Wouldn't help your wife's problem much  but might help yours I have been through this THREE times in my life  and I'm a 31 year old Engineer  I can think of a few things  This last time I was given a Career Coach as part of my package  and it was the VERY best thing that ever happened to me  She rewrote my resume to the point where I gave it to a recruiter and he found me multiple interviews and 2 of them offered me a job  Go to your unemployment office  There are people there who rewrite resumes for a living  The criticism can be harsh  but taking their advice is the best thing I ever did  Now the main thing I did EVERY DAY but Sunday    I applied to THREE JOBS every day  If you do this you are doing your part and everything else will fall into place  I kept a PDF print of each job so if someone called me I could quickly pull it up  I had an excel chart that detailed each job title  location  date I applied  any website passwords  etc  Once you do 3 jobs a day  focus on some of these other things people are listing  the gym etc   You will feel better knowing you are pulling your fair weight to get a job  And 3 is a proven number the career coach will tell you about  Hang in there    this makes you even more FA than me  and i didn't even think that was possible   because i wouldn't even notice if this sub dissapearedI'm really sorry for your lost   Excellent suggestion  I'll do that i dont even think my mom wished my happy new year  but to be fair i totally forgot it was my sis birthdayYeah  when one is depressed he or she doesn't care to look at the problem optimistically and prefers to find fault in it as you stated  Your frustration is understandable  just be sure to be delicate in the future    Have a happy new year  "I'm cute  and full of confidence  what do " pick up a pencil  a pen  a paintbrush  you might be surprised by what you can do   or pick up your phone  go out and take pictures of things you like  try to take them from a completely different perspective   let creativity be your friend  let it inspire you  let your emotions come out in the pieces you do   if you have any free museums near you  visit them  some art galleries and city buildings are also free to visit  learn something there   i was unemployed for about four months  i quit my full time job due to constantly being harassed verbally by my coworkers  and having a management team who couldn't give a shit  i can't say i understand your exact situation  as i was living with my mum at the time    that nothingness isn't sappy or anything  it's a void that can take over your life  i spent most of my days laying in bed  staring at the wall  or sitting in my bathroom alone  that became my world  the days where i turned myself to art  those days i felt alive  i didn't have the energy most days  but those days made it worth it    i am sorry that things have gone to shit for you  keep searching for work  even consider something you've never tried before  you might be surprised how you may qualify   this is coming from someone who is one of the only people on the team without a degree  but hired because of my passion and attitude   go into any interview feeling confident  i don't care if you don't feel confident  fake that shit  get some good mood tunes blasting in your vehicle before the interview  be prepared with a copy of your resume  don't be afraid to go into the interview with notes or questions you have about the place of employment   ask  questions  ask damn good ones  too  there was a recent thread on reddit about the best questions you can ask in an interview  ask them    and last of all  don't forget  it's not the end of the world  it's time for a new start and you can seize the motherfuckin' day  I have for sure  I am not seeing any other option at this point  I am not totally sure what kind of therapist though because I don't know how to classify my problem This is hard  It happens to many but I think its different for everyone  For me it took years and a series of events for me to be more confident with myself  I will share a few things which I hope will help as it seems you have looked a lot and found a lot of the basic coping techniques   As you know it basically comes down to accepting who you are and not caring what other people think because what you think other people are thinking about you is normally not even close to reality  This however is hard to just stop doing overnight as we all know   You need to find ways of realizing you are actually as good or better then others  For me that was finding my passions and pursuing them and the realization that the majority of other people are just as insecure as I am but they are better at hiding it    I also think that we think we know how others are perceiving us which is not true  Most people will think of you as a lot better or more normal then how you see your self and the same goes for how we see others  Generally we see them with very few flaws but they see themselves as being inadequate but the ones who don't show it are the ones who don't really care so much  They still feel inadequate and may not talk to you because they are actually think you are more mature normal intelligent cool wateva   Also if people say you are socially awkward in a condescending way its most likely because they are trying to bring you down because they are insecure about themselves    To sum up you are better then you think  Work on doing what makes you happy and you will be a better self  You don't come across nearly as bad as you think you do  Your still young and growing so don't beat yourself up too much    Hope this mess of words in a poor writing structure helps in some way   Happy 2017   We don't go outside   literally speaking  normies have no ideaAll of the congratulations  Im finally going to party  i thought it was gonna be suicide lmaowho fucking cares about women men  i just wanna be a normie  Well welcome to this sub   LMAOO  Because as human males we sometimes need the acceptance or love from woman to feel human   i'm a biological FA woman and this almost makes me glad i'm not male  after reading so much from the internet  i realize men are so weak when it comes to women or sex  i don't even care about thatme since 12  i'm 23 nowugh  Yeah either quit drinking or just drink a whole lot less  I know it's fun to get wasted at parties  but luckily for me I just get super slow and not all hyper like some others  I say stupid shit but I don't go crazy  What did you say that made him uncomfortable while he was puking drunk  Kind of odd if he was that wasted that something struck deep  This post has been removed    r Health does not allow images  screenshot and other pictures   If you are looking for help

convinced my mum YEARS ago to quit when I told her about second hand smoke and that if she'd continue she'd put my life in a lot of danger  I was like 9 years old at the time lol   Sometimes parents won't quit for themselves but for you  Gather some info  tell her how she's effecting her environment and go from there  Definitely  I was just frustrated someone who claimed to care about me would say this The worst is when you text out happy new year to your Facebook contacts and get no response That's not your decision to make  It's up to her  She is the one to decide  If you have feelings  and you have to tell her  go ahead  The worst is she'll say no I cannot thank you enough for explaining that to me  It seriously baffled me as to why they are highly praised  I completely agree with you  Your post sends out a positive message of change  thank you for sharing it  Maybe consider reposting it in other subReddits to inspire more people    take care and happy new yearthey dont even careUh in my opinion  kiddie porn is a hell of a lot more awful and evil than being into a cuckold fantasy  It does not matter how others view you  This guy physically assaulted you  it doesn't matter if it ruins there relationship  I would talk to your cousin  And stand your ground  This is what happened  This is how I reacted and this is how I felt  I hope everything goes well  I'm talking about high school Good idea  I'll use that as one of my reasons to her  But there's once problem  I'm going to be moving out in about a year and a half with friends to college  I guess I will have to convince her to quit permanently  She is very resilient and stubborn  so this will be hard but I'm going to try my best  I weened myself off of Norco  which is similar to Oxycontin  after back surgery  At first I was taking around 40 mg per day  and I tapered it off to 5 mg over the course of some weeks  Then I thought 5 mg wasn't much  so it was probably time to stop   I was at work  and I started feeling pain all over my body  kind of like when you get the flu and all your muscles ache  Except my skin hurt too  Then I started feeling super antsy  like I just wanted to get up and do something physical and possibly a little violent  like sparring   Finally I remembered about the Norco  went home for lunch and took 2 5 mg  which I thought would do nothing  But it calmed me down pretty fast  and after that I didn't need it anymore   I'm fortunate that it doesn't do anything for me besides relieve pain  though  One time I got a shot of morphine in the hospital  and that was the most lovely feeling in the world  like  that scene in Breaking Bad where Jesse gets his first taste of heroin  https   www youtube com watch v Ri0cifENxm0   I still remember it decades later  Norco just stops the pain and makes me feel dull  no fun at all  plus there's the constipation  so it's easy to kick r nocontextYou too brother  have a good and appreciate the advice  talk to the teacher and tell her how you feel  if you are dismissed  or if another incident takes place  talk to the teachers' boss  aka the principal   you should be able to talk to your teacher about such things without fear of repercussion  that is her job  if she isn't doing a good job  then her boss needs to know First  please stop beating yourself up for your immediate reaction to this assault  You did nothing wrong here and don't deserve to be tortured over the fact that you froze rather than speaking up immediately    Is your assessment of how your family might react based on their reactions to your prior abuse  I suspect they may not react as poorly as you believe  but you know your family better than an Internet stranger  obviously    I would suggest approaching one member of your family that you trust to believe you and to  make your safety  physical and emotional  their top priority  Tell them about the incident and get their advice as an interested party who knows the players involved    I'm sorry this happened to you  I'm also sorry that I don't have better advice for you  but I hope that it helps to know there is at least one person out here who is thinking of and praying for you  Very much so the same for me   i was speaking about evil in terms of self destructiveness  inwardly evil i got almost two months off from school after fall quarter  classes start on tuesday for me  of course im working on my BAS but i too have to get back on track with a sleep schedule   best thing that works for me is making "to do" lists of assignments for that week only  dont try and cram everything in  just focus on that week  if your teacher doesnt have everything planned out for that week  shes a terrible teacher  you could ask her if you might be able to have a calendar or something   for getting yourself back on track with sleep schedule try  drinking a glass of  room temp water  hot warm is always the best for me  very soothing  about 10 15 mins before bed  it will help get your body relaxed and cozy   do some deep breathing  dosnt have to be a lot either  just 4 6 DEEP breaths  and slowly let it out   again the key is to relax   lastly  i get so caught up on shit  seriously i worry too much sometimes about the dumbest shit  Let it go and tell your body its time to rest and tomorrow is a new day FRESH BODY MIND is the No  1 Online Resource to Learn about The Power of Nature's

reason  If it were anything real  Then it wouldn't be a FANTASY  Everybody has something they think is embarrassing  but what you are experiencing is one of the most common fetishes in existence  I'm not saying to go through with it  personally I like to keep my fantasies separate from my actual love life  but you have to just accept that what's in your mind is in YOUR mind  Nobody else will ever know about it but you  And it's not a big deal  You have to understand that it's not a big deal at all  If your not comfortable with sharing the fantasy with your S O  then don't  let it remain as it is  But don't contemplate suicide because you think you are fucked up for having such a fantasy  like come on dude  There is nothing wrong with you  "OxyContin is a chemical cousin of heroin"  Ugh   Where do people come up with this   Heroin is diacetyl morphine  OxyContin is Oxycodone   They are like apples and oranges If you are not able to diet or exercise to lose all the weight  you should opt for weight loss surgery  In Southern California I'm conflicted  because as someone who is fairly awkward and overly self conscious it lets me be the kind of person I wish came naturally to me  but then I do things that I can't take back  This is the first time I've really felt the weight of potential consequences that one night of drinking can have on your life   It's also the first time you've allowed yourself to get this drunk  no  For most people  there's the "happy drunk" stage  which gives way to the "somewhat desperate  impulsive drunk" stage  which can progress to the "pitiful nightmare drunk" stage  The key to holding your booze is to never allow yourself to progress past happy drunk  I know it can be tempting to try to get a little looser  but it rarely works out for the best  You've now experienced significant consequences from drinking to excess  so hopefully you will be able to moderate your behaviour better next time    I HATE THAT I CAN'T BE SOCIAL AND FUN TO BE AROUND WITHOUT ALCOHOL BUT IN THE END IT BITES ME IN THE ASS AND RUINS MY FRIENDSHIPS   In my experience  alcohol isn't usually the only ingredient in this phenomenon  At best  alcohol is going to cause generalised disinhibition  You might feel a bit happier for a short period  After this period  your brain will adjust  You will no longer feel so happy  you will just have more difficulty controlling your impulses  Whether this works out for you will depend on other factors  like your existing social skills  the people around you  and how you are dealing with the stress in your life  If these things are going badly  then drinking probably won't help you socialise  To the contrary  it will likely make things worse    Alcohol is such an ingrained part of the culture that I'm going to be faced with the pressure of drinking all the time  I was promising myself that I was going to put myself out there this semester  but realistically that doesn't involve me not being a part of the party scene  I don't know what to do   I'm not part of the party scene  but do other people even know how much you are drinking  The problem with being a drunk is that if you don't have people looking out for you  you're fucked  As a man  no one is going to hold your hair and stroke your back while you vomit  No one is going to encourage you to get sexual  unless it's to laugh at you  If you're going to party  you need to be able to take care of yourself  You probably won't be able to do this if you get wasted all the time  or if you're prone to depression because of a shitty lifestyle  To put it another way  maybe partying only once a week and drinking in moderation is all most of us are cut out for   I'd say that for every guy who does cool shit when drunk  there are 10 more who wake up in a pile of vomit with humiliating flashbacks Come join us at r financialindependence  You have the option to walk away and be able to live a life that makes you happy  You need to at least take a break and travel and relax  Get some hobbies  Step away from the business and be a 20 year old  take care  man  You are far from being a failure  I wish I were near you to help give you a break  There is no shame in needing help  There's a reason families were so large and lived in such close proximity to each other many years ago    I'm so grateful you have such an amazingly supportive spouse  Get the help you need   including a babysitter for a couple of hours each week  Our first priority is ourselves  not spouses or children  If we aren't operating as best as possible  we can't meet their needs  Doing something about it would help   WOW  I never thought of that  how could I have been so blind  Thanks for the reply  We work pretty close so I don't want to screw that up but I have tried gradually not talking and only socializing with other people at work and walking away before she could start  Worked well but then I think she was feeling jealous so she started being friendly again and now were back here again   I can't cut her off completely as we work together on occasions but I can get her far enough away to be happy  I'm just not sure what to do when she starts bragging about how great her life is and then downplaying mine  Do I try and play up my life as she is doing or just be really vague or something else  i don't know    Hmm  this sounds like a very tricky situation  First off  I'm sorry this and previous instances happened to you  and I hope it doesn't happen again   I would say that this isn't something that should be kept secret  I guess it really depends on how your family would take it  and from what you've said  it sounds like they really care about you  If they already know about the previous instances  maybe they would be more understanding   I guess trying to think more on the strategy side of things  it's like  if you appeared to your family to already have something against him or your cousin  they'd think more that you were just trying to break them apart and ruin them  I wouldn't know  but it sounds like this isn't the case and that he was fine up until this point  I assume it would come as a shock to your family to hear  but I don't think they would just assume you were lying  Of course  this is up to you to judge  If they really care about you  especially more than them  they should do the right thing try posting this in  r lonely  this sub is mostly for people who have never been in a relationship in the first place  People here aren't likely to respond well if you mention an ex  even if it's not the

video about my goals for the upcoming year Yeah  well  being a little bit healthier wouldn't get us anywhere either  and then we'd have no outlet for our feelings Glad I could help   I know its hard to truly believe but trust me it really is   I was like you when I was 14  I'm now 23  Its not easy and will take time and persistence but you will get there if you believe in yourself and don't stop trying       The limiting of the stomachs capacity means less intake  I'll share a bit of my experience    I'm twenty two  well  I will be on the fifth  and have suffered depression  partly spurred on by an abusive brother  since I was about 8 years old  I started cutting when I was twelve and My first suicide attempt was when I was 13  and I've tried so many times since then that I've lost count  I've been hospitalized in psych wards at least thirty times  and even recently spent some time in a mental hospital  I've only in the past year regained my will to live  From what I've learned through all of this is this  those thoughts  thoughts that you'd be better off dead  thoughts that everyone is better off without you  thoughts of hurting yourself  they're just that  thoughts  You don't have to act on them  They may never go away and you just have to live with them  but the more you ignore them  the less persistent they become  Are you serious dude  Seriously maybe just don't jack off in front of her  If she is literally making you just jerk off until your dick hurts then you should leave that relationship  You know what would happen if I tried to make my girl do ANYTHING that caused her repeated discomfort  She'd leave my ass and rightfully so  I mean honestly dude the answer is right in front of your eyes  I mean come on  If she tries to MAKE you jack off in front of her  well that's just fucking weird  Thank you so much  Not american  but two years of high school left Xtest Pro was really anti climactic for me  This is the spitting image of that  Health and

fouls up the place  Click Here  http   www mysupplementsera com xtest reviews He touched on it there  but I'll say it again  Volunteering  It keeps you productive  gives you opportunity to put skills to use  gives you some much needed networking opportunity   Most importantly  it keeps you from lolling around the house and gets you up in the morning to go act like a professional  and stops you having a big ugly gap on your resume  Makes you look a lot more legit as a prospect  complete  well  in the literal sense  valuable  LOL noMy first sentiment is     its tough to counsel and that's why people get paid to do it    Also as someone who actually just started therapy today    that kid knows what he should be doing  He just has a mental block into actually doing it    It's best with these things to lead a horse to water but let them make their own plan    i e  how would you foresee fixing this obvious issue and leading the conversation in that direction  Its hard to tell     i would keep consistent and not treat them any different just because they aren't 'returning the favour' yet  It could be as simple as them being busy   we should never assume   Also  try and look at it in terms of 'abundance'  you should be happy to see them but if it doesn't happen you should always have other options  If people feel like your desperate or they are your only option they might be a bit reluctant to go too far out of their way for you   Put yourself out there more  go to social events like music  bars  extend your social circles  it might seem really hard at first but even in a small town its quite easy once you get some momentum   Dont make these people your priority  you need to have a passion  something that makes your eyes light up when people ask you about it  Thats what excites people  people are drawn to seeing someone who is self driven and not dependant on what they can offer you   Another thing worth mentioning is some people are just like that  one of my best friends  10 years    never calls  never asks me to hang out ect  However he is more than happy for me to show up un announced at his house and that is what happens 90  of the time   For  along time this did bother me and i looked inward thinking i wasn't that fun to be around  over time i've accepted thats just the dynamic of our relationship    Funny thing is  this guy grew up on a small farm   maybe there is a connection there with independence or something   Regardless  its always a good idea to make more varied friends  who knows you might find someone who actually ends up pestering you everyday and think to yourself "gee  why can't they just leave me alone sometimes and wait until i contact them "  Irony      Ahh ok well I don't know if you have an option for GED or equivalent where you are  If you do you could look into something like that  Regarding high school  I 100  say complete it  Maybe take easier classes if you can Just tell her the truth  You have no need to try and impress her  There is also a fair chance that they are intimidated by you  Your body language and words can be a lot more powerful in social situations then physical size or gender  I know girls who are tiny and no one will mess with them just because of their personality and body language They are analogues with a similar chemical structure   Oxycodone a more basic structure   They are also both opiates and behave similarly in vivo   ThanksHad a similar issue with a girl man  sadly she said no to me but I look back on it now and I realized that I just waited for too long  If I had only asked her out sooner I know she would have said yes  but I waited and ended up in the friend zone  Fuck it  ask her out  Live with no regrets  Plus  you're in 10th grade  if she for some reason says no  you have a whole life ahead of you full of girls Yes  just like there are "sunday football players" there are "sunday prostitutes" who are mostly housewives or single mothers who earn some extra cash on the side during the weekend or when husband is away  I haven't actually been to any  but the descriptions of how sex was sounded so much hotter and organic Thanks  I'll do it I think if you can find a way  perhaps some professional opinion  to confirm or deny your doubts  you should try that  Maybe a talk with a psychologist or something  Maybe a serious discussion with your husband would also be called for  but I'm not sure  Sorry if this wasn't very helpful tbh i think swiping right on everyone will only lead to more rejectionsI would just stay up all night and tomorrow go to sleep around midnight and wake up at 10  Thanks for your advice man  Any and all thoughts towards this helps me kinda just make sense of it all  I actually have no idea what I said to him  and he wouldn't say either when I asked  I too was wondering what it was  I don't know if physically I was "horsing around" and he wasn't in the mood  puking his brains out   or if I said something that struck him negatively   He is my best friend  and I would never do anything like this sober  But it's not an excuse  and I have to change something if I want him to forgive me fully  I know if I don't change  that's when you lose friends family  It was more of a disappointment in me  and it really hit me hard when he told me it was like dealing with a stranger  and I wasn't acting like me at all   All I can hope for is that he sees this change and will take note I am not going to let it happen again  Okay one last question  what so you think about the comparision between old and new Home simply not beeing fair  I mean everytime I am visiting my hometown I dont have to persue my normal student working life while having a great time compared to persuing a stressfull but normal student life  Point is life might be just the same way if I move home since I would start to study there  Thank you so much Thank you very much  3Yes  it is because of a reaction I received in the past when telling someone about what happened  but not with family  I do hope you're right that they would react well   Your advice and kind words mean so much to me  thank you  3I don't think you should worry about it that much    Honestly  the depth and self awareness that you have just pointed out is well beyond your years   High school is a hard time for most  and the people that breeze through that period of their life often peak way too early   Your still growing and learning every day  don't beat yourself up because you feel like your not the same as your peers   In my experience   myself included  those who are alienated in school often have a much larger potential  It sounds like your mentally mature for your age   You are putting in effort to better and self improve yourself at a young age which is definitely a sign of good things to come    Just be yourself and don't define yourself based on how your peers see you  You will catch up and overtake them soon enough with that attitude   when you were in that mind state  you had let go of everyone else judgement and you were truly yourself  But slowly everyones expectations of you caught back up with you    you just had a glimpse into how life should be  now go out and find it again Hello  I'm not a trained professional  but I'm 27 and have the same problems   I suffer from social anxiety and it's pretty manageable when you learn a few tricks   I'm not saying that's what you have  but it sounds like it   I just tell myself that at the end of the day even if someone is judging me which 99 100 times they aren't  but I understand how you feel like they are  that it doesn't matter  You will still go about your business and be happy doing your thing   If they are judging you then chances are they are just compensating for one of their own problems so don't let it become an issue in your head   You just have to become aware of what triggers your anxiety and find a way to counteract it  Every situation will be different  but once you identify the problem it will be a whole lot easier  Keep your head up   Confidence    It definitely makes the best difference  The problem is that when we are FA  we have nothing to feed our confidence  So we have to kickstart the circle by faking confidence before it becomes natural  It's a paradox  But that's how girls work Holy shit  I wish people could pay me to bully them for 10 to 15 minutes for  50  I would happily do it I'm confident that it does exist That's a good assessment  I think realistically  most of my family would believe me since I am very well liked but some of them may never see me the same way again   Thank you so much for your perspective  3Tragedy and comedy are one in the same thing This Thread for me gives the sense of company even when you are alone if you look at the comments to most posts you'll see we try to cheer each other up at least as much as we can i dont know the entirety of your relationship but what you described sounds pretty emotionally abusive and narcissistic behaviorHave you considered not being a shitbag  but being worth someone else's time The worst thing you can do is never tell her  I made that mistake  I had the perfect chance to ask her out  she dressed all cute on the last day of school  and had been flirting with me all year long  I really liked her but I didn't ask her out  I regret it all the time    Ask her out dude  If you guys talk a lot and she flirts with you  or you just know each other really well  she will probably say yes  The worst thing you could do is not ask her out like I did  I am close to your age and in a similar situation   It seems like this is the worst age to have no friends at because most people in our age group have full social lives  between families and friends from their youth   When I try to meet new people it seems like they are only interested in me for sex or money   I've been in therapy for years and I don't think it's helped at all   it's nice to have a chance to talk to someone and relieve the feelings of loneliness and isolation  but therapists aren't friends  if you stop paying them they stop caring   I guess I don't really have any advice but just know that you're not alone   There are lots and lots of us socially isolated people  I think most of them start committing suicide once they hit their fifties and realize it's only going to get worse Yeah dude you got this  You got your priorities straight  Making sure you're on good terms with your friends and family over drinking  I agree with the others that you should trust your therapist in order to find the therapy useful  It seems you'd have to change your therapist  or then just acknowledge that the therapist is there for YOU  and to help YOU  and nothing else   I know I had the same problem with my therapist when I started to seek help for my depression  but it got better once I really worked with my emotions and learned to trust her  It was hard af to trust some random person youve just met  but if you manage to talk about everything with him her  it's gonna help you a lot   My best wishes for your process  stay strong    I have every intention to stay in academia  so I see nothing but school in my future  My country also doesn't have community colleges  just research intensive universities  All graduate degrees here require the corresponding undergraduate degree for entrance My son got a 28 and is so happy  Congrats to you and a perfect score you should be so proud of yourself your cousin also deserves to know her fiancé is a prick   tell everyone   make him the one who doesn't wanna go to family events   he  should  be embarrassed  not you   You said you love the MMA training   is time a factor because you can't fit it in with work  If so it must be possible to pursue it as a weekend thing   All I know is that if you really love it you should find a way to make room for it  Life is too short to put what could be your true calling on hold How do I tell people   Even when I'm lucid and  actually  rational it scares me to say it   I feel like something bad will happen if I tell people about the worst parts  like they'll hurt me or that they'll lock me up forever   Sometimes when I'm really energetic  manic maybe  I'll blurt out something I believe   Like that if I don't keep all the lights on in part of the house  something bad will be there   And after I tell them that  if they turn off the lights I think it's on purpose because they want me to be killed   I'm so scared to tell people in person  I'll probably even delete this whole account later Damn  only saw this today Hey man  I'm sorry you're feeling lonely first of all  That is a rough feeling and it can be hard to find relief  From your post  it sounds like you struggle with maintaining hope that you can start to feel better and become happy again  I have definitely felt like there was no way out  and no point in even trying  Your part about how being happy in the past makes you feel worse because you remember what it feels like absolutely resonates with me  For a while  it felt like my only reprieve came from reliving those good memories    You also talk about how you need support and have nowhere to turn  There's absolutely nothing wrong with that  Everyone wants support and someone to talk to  and you shouldn't feel ashamed for wanting that  Someone like a therapist or counselor can really help with initiating an emotional connection  and I can tell you from personal experience that they do help  It's a lot easier opening up to a therapist than a friend  in my experience  I was depressed only a couple years ago  for a few years  and I truly believe that with enough baby steps you can be happy again   If you're like I was when I was depressed however  you may be skeptical  Whenever I heard about someone who recovered from depression  I always thought they weren't  truly  depressed  or weren't as depressed as me  Or maybe their circumstances were different  or they were stronger than me  and so it was easier for them  Well  it is true that we have different circumstances  and so maybe you think there's still no hope for you  but hopefully I can show you that what you feel and think isn't always right    I'm talking about   cognitive distortions    which are when your brain tells you things that aren't true  Here's a page detailing a common few  http   psychcentral com lib 15 common cognitive distortions   You talk about how you can never be happy again  but why do you think that  You were happy 2 months ago  weren't you  You say that you fool yourself into thinking you're happy  but isn't that just an example of minimizing your accomplishments  Just because you feel depressed doesn't mean any happiness you feel isn't real  And just because you feel hopeless doesn't mean there is no hope for you  That's an example of   emotional reasoning     We believe that what we feel must be true automatically  If we feel stupid and boring  then we must be stupid and boring  You assume that your unhealthy emotions reflect he way things really are  I feel it  therefore it must be true   from the link above   Have you ever decided that someone won't like you before you meet them  Do you ever think that because you're not feeling happy now  you will never feel happy again  These are all examples of cognitive distortions  One good way I learned and am currently learning to deal with these negative  invasive thoughts is by using a website called https   moodgym anu edu au welcome  It's an online form of cognitive behavioral therapy which helps with learning to identify and deal with these negative and frankly incorrect thoughts  It isn't a replacement for therapy  but can be a good way to get you more started on the road to recovery   As for other things to help you get healthy  the key is taking baby steps  I keep a journal where I write one small victory every day  It could be going on a run  or even being extra nice to myself  You could try  for just 5 minutes a day  to treat yourself as you would a good friend going through a rough time  and then write down whenever you were nice to yourself  And when you say that you want to curl up and cry  then cry  Letting yourself feel those emotions and not trying to bottle them in is a great example of being kind to yourself   I want to remind you to reach out to a professional  and to remember that just because you feel yourself losing hope  does not mean health is out of your reach at all  Remember to take your thoughts and feelings with a grain of salt  since they're often just wrong and do more harm than good    Much love and if you want to talk or have any questions  shoot me a PM  I'd be more than happy to talk    Alex  Sounds like y'all need some couples therapy Those who have success have built confidence Thanks  I try to recognize the fact that everyone is in the same boat as well   I can be incredibly vindictive but joining groups on meetup and hearing people out helps me understand different perspectives   I'm trying to gain that bit of empathy that I seem to have lost along the way    I'll do everything I can to love myself as a whole     There was a post somewhere around here about YearCompass   I printed out their booklet and I'm going through it at the moment reflecting on my past year and what I have to look forward to   It's really helped me in realizing what I've gone through and how I've changed   It's been helpful in analyzing myself without judgement Well we aren't supposed to make diagnoses but you should make an appointment with a trained professional   As you said yourself you believe you're "mighty" and smarter than everyone due to being bullied which is a sign of a certain mental illness   Being bullied wouldn't make you smarter   Studying will  Your joy from death and other people's pain  along with your violent mind set all are signs of the same illness  I would get it checked out before it gets out of control because it can be managed  Getting paranoid over an obscure chemical compound that you haven't even been in contact with doesn't sound healthy  If I were you  I'd set up an appointment with a psychiatrist or doctor  When your teeth start to look yellow or are showing stains  and you are no longer happy with what was once your beautiful smile  it is time to find a cosmetic dentist in Gresham  Seems like I'm in the same boat as you as in regards to the class levels and the stress  I'm not sure if it'll help much  but I shmooped and sparknoted the shit out of the book I procrastinated on  Pardon my language lol   If you know you can't finish the book  do as much research as you can on the plot line and then think of some topics that could be on the debate  Remember to answer the opposition  and stay as general as you can if you can't do that  Stay calm  You're going to be fine OP  I'm guessing there's some underlying stress you have that's been on your mind for a while that's getting you down  If you want to talk about anything  you can pm me  Good luck on your debate c   P s  I almost forgot about the audiobooks on YouTube  but there's that too  I hope I'm not too late Woohoo motivation  Thank you so much  This actually really helped           I hope you're right about the large potential I have  my mental age and self improving at a young age is a sign of good things to come  It doesn't seem right  Shouldn't people my age who don't have to improve have more potential  They already mastered what I'm working on improving  so that must mean they are working in even more things   And next you're going to say showers don't exist either "You play baseball like a girl"I understand  I think I was exaggerating a bit with my original post though  I'm not that paranoid I just wanted to know what others might have to say Yeah  I hate shopping as well because it reminds me of what I look like vs what other people can wear and look great in You may be misconstruing what confidence is  Let there be two people   1  Guy 1  who isn't confident to ask out girls and never does  2  Guy 2  who isn't confident  but acts like he's confident and asks a girl out  the act of asking a girl out shows confidence   Guy 2 will always perform better than Guy 1  all else being equal It might be easier to say out loud any thoughts coming to your head with closer ppl  Try to fight the thinking "this is too stupid to say out loud" if thats the matter  In no time you'll propably come up with things to add to conversations   And hey  you dont even know them well  so just dont give a f what they might think of what you say  Its not that serious business  if its not work related  D  Psst    Your " "s make the list items a top level title  largest

You watch a video of people being hurt in a natural disaster   Should you feel guilty for this     My answer is no to both   You weren't involved in the war  and you didn't cause the natural disaster   Therefore you have no reason to apologize for watching the videos   As someone who almost quit high school when I was younger and really put no effort into my final years of high school   Don't quit

when they said get a job doing what you love and you'll never work a day of your life  Total lie  It's still work and you'll end up hating the job eventually  plus now you'd be out of a hobby too   The real answer is to find something you're good at  and give it everything you have  With your degree   I'm assuming you stopped at the bs level  you aren't done with school  That degree is next to worthless without a master's of some kind  Maybe consider law  It's actually a great degree to pair with a JD  You can become the jury panel expert  They get paid bank plus one    For me  i finished

simply getting by    P s  i have also dealt with depression and was diagnosed as bipolar  I was on most of the major meds  welbutrin  Prozac  lithium  etc  The meds made everything worse  They wouldn't m make me happy  just numb  which i found worse than the depression  Mix in the horrific side effects some have  and i noped the fuck out of treatment soon as i moved away for college  they started me on meds in 2nd grade   What ultimately got me head under my control was a mixture of meditation  regular exercise nothing gets those endorphins flowing like a dead lift   regular sleep  a healthy sexual relationship  and a balanced diet  using myfitnesspal  Mine joke about how my brother will be the reason they have grandchildren  They laugh about it  I do to  But I'm my head I'm

depressed  Since then I've seen things from his perspective and I feel like shit for not understanding his POV and acting like I did  I recommend r wholesomememesThe point of this post is that you can't "act confident" when all you've ever known is loneliness and rejection  It's not a choice  If guy 2 is able to 'act confident' its because deep down he knows he has a shot  no matter how slim  otherwise he wouldn't even bother asking the girl out  Guy 1 is unconfidemt and doesn't ask the girl out because he has no "confidence" that asking the girl out is worth the emberassment of rejection  Now  that lack of confidence may be all in his head but  either way  in his mind it's not  In guy 1's mind  through years of experiences that has shaped his mentality  this barrier is very real  There's a deeply rooted psychological barrier there that he's not able to just cast aside and ask the girl out  I am more of a single malt scotch hipster  Although  given the price  I may try the JB one of these days  Something people haven't mentioned that might help you personally is find a helping project that gives back  Especially if you hire a CEO it would be a good idea because you'll have less stress and more time  Figure out something you care about that needs help and go help  You mentioned you didn't come from much  maybe help underprivileged  you could create a way for them to learn more about technology so they have a skill to offer  Or you could help foster children  education  people with a particular sickness  Anything you have a connection to and see a need for aid  be the aid  It doesn't have to be big and fancy like a company  Just you giving back society  It's a very good way to raise your mental state Do it on the side  Don't make it your main source of income unless someone straight up signs you in the next 2 years  Well  people should be honest and stop using "like you" and instead use "similar to you but with better  insert dating criteria " In my experience  it's a skill just like anything else  As such  it takes constant practice  What's helped me personally is talking to myself in front of a mirror and trying my best to be articulate about an idea  Maybe about what I'm going to do for the rest of the day  my opinion on a topic  etc  I keep particular focus on what I want to improve each time I do this  Sometimes I focus on making my sentences flow together  other times I try to improve my enunciation  I was inarticulate in the beginning  and still am in certain topics  but I have improved to the point where I find speaking far easier in every day life  in arguments or casual conversation    Hopefully this helps you  Hey  writing is a huge passion for me as well   I was just in the middle of recommending Stephen King's "On Writing" when I decided to read your other post and realized you were way ahead of me    It seems you are really concerned in being the best and that determination to be the best can be used to fuel your success   At 15 you have an incredible potential to improve   Your brain is still developing and forming new connections  your perception of the world has only begun to form   Personally  those high school years were rough   I was always incredibly hard on myself for everything that I did   Even if there was an objective scale that declared my work as the greatest in all of time and space  I would still deny it and continue reaching for more  I did some quick looking around and found this  I think it will best explain what I think will help you  http   soulanatomy org the psychological reason creative people are their own worst critics   Be kind to yourself and don't be afraid to expose your work to the world   You will improve with time  there is no sense in condemning yourself to obscurity so early in the process It's most likely dead   But if you're handy with tools it may be fixable     Most small motorized appliances have a thermal fuse that prevents the device from overheating too badly   If it was designed to work on eggs and you used it on thick batter  the motor probably overheated and blew the thermal fuse   Sometimes that fuse self resets  but usually not     If you open it up  unplug it first  somewhere near the motor will be the thermal fuse  which usually looks something like this  http   freek heaters com pics products cap10 4 g gif    It may be wrapped to the motor with zip ties and or Kapton tape  the clear ish orange y tape      If you take out the fuse  you can read what's on the side of it and get a replacement fuse  which will likely have to be crimped or soldered into the wire in place of the old one    You'll also want some Kapton tape to re attach it as it was   DO NOT DO NOT use normal tape  normal tape melts easily and can catch fire  Kapton tape does not     Otherwise just throw the appliance away and get a new one    Do some people  insert any behavior that is physically possible to be exhibited by humans      Yes Be strong friend  Reach out even if it's just to one person  Having someone to lighten the load will do wonders  Thank you so much for sharing  You've given me a lot of stuff to think about  I had a rough time in college  so I've been hesitant about doing more school  I think it might be time to rethink that   If you don't mind me asking  how is your depression nowadays  I'm off meds and I'm managing my depression similarly  exercise  diets  some supplements  and socializing   It's a LOT better than my worst bouts  but I still feel pretty disinterested and unmotivated  I hope this isn't the best I can do  Your post gives me a lot of hope  so thanks again for that Pretend your talking to them over the phone or even in real life  Ask her about her day and stuff  Be genuinely interested in what she has to say and constantly participate in the conversation  Girls love being heard and love it when they know guys are actually listening and care about what they have to say  Hi mate  Sorry to hear about your situation  Have you ever tried the app website "MeetUp"  or something similar  I've heard good things about them  It's basically set up for some local people with similar interests to get together and do things that they enjoy   Also  I second the therapy option  as a way to help you get a footing in your situation  It's not embarrassing to go  so maybe you could give it a shot  Lastly   actively  seek out opportunities where there will be people congregating and room for interaction  Whether this be a show  a concert  a tour  a baking class  or whatever it is  just do it  Who knows  maybe you'll find another hobby that gives you a little boost of fulfillment in your life  These situations are best set up for interacting with people  I have problems getting beyond the acquaintance level sometimes as well  and a lot of it is because I put up barriers and walls between myself and other people  I also subconsciously tell myself that people aren't interested in me or what I have to say  It helps to do confidence boosting activities  hobbies  exercising  eating well  etc    A handful of mindfulness in social situations also greatly helps  and sometimes you quite literally need to put yourself out there and outside your comfort zone  Be bold  Be unbashful  Don't stress too much about what others think  and most of all  just be more unequivocally you  Just be yourself in social situations  Open up to people and ask people to open up to you  if they feel comfortable after a but of time of course   Keep with it man  Seriously  it's never too late  Don't lose hope  Just do the things you love  try to find groups that do similar things  and you're already off to a good start  Also  try relocating to a new or more busy place with a diversity of people  You're bound to find someone who you can appreciate your time  The first step was asking for help  So good luck man Hi there  Unfortunately this post has been removed  links to personal sites   gofundme pages are not allowed in  r needadvice   Please feel free to re post this without any gofundme or other personal links if you have an actual question   Thanks I keep myself to busy to notice depression usually  It's actually a little worse tonight than usual because I'm home visiting family and i have too much time to think and remember and what if  But that's OK  sometimes a little sad is important to keep perspective    Just set goals and work to them  Ambitious goals that are realistically obtainable by you  Have a 10 year goal  a 5 year goal  a two year goal  and many short term goals  Use a calendar  If you don't write it down  it isn't happening  On the opposite side I'd tell OP to be careful with your advice as that may push him into the friendzone region Yeah  this post seems to be aimed at people jumping from one relationship to the other to avoid adressing personal flaws or something   I look at that and I can't help but call it thrash  they clearly don't know what being FA  friendless FA even more  does to the mind of someone over the years  Sense of self worth  What's that   I see all of the successful guys out there and for whatever reason people always want to go back to them  For friendship or something further  I'm never that person for anyone and I wish I could be  in theory yes but its unlikely that most of these people will ever truly challenge themselves the way that you are already doing right now   Do you think your friends are on reddit right now trying to improve themselves   its more likely they are comfortable with what they have and the ego can be a very dangerous thing in that regard   Being confident and socially sharp takes consistent effort and its not something you can just master  coming from a place where you know both sides of the spectrum will only drive you to first achieve what you want  but to know the importance of maintaining your skill set   People become complacent with what they have and if they are not forced to better themselves  they tend to go backwards over time   the best example i can relate would be my own experience   Through school i was often feeling very alienated  never got dates like my friends ect  It really got me down but it only made me work harder to achieve what i wanted and to be accepted  I was always very curious and analysed my surroundings constantly  Fast forward to now   23 male  i have everything i want and if theres something i don't have i know the steps to achieve it  I have many solid friends  and hundreds of 'surface' friends and am often 'missed' if I'm not there  I am able to approach desirable in demand women almost effortlessly and they pursue me   Now when i run into these people who bullied or unintentionally put themselves above me i have no angst towards them  i actually feel sorry for some of them because of how little they have actually grown since high school and i can see how unhappy they are  Trust me  the 'cool guys'  'jocks' or whatever they are to you don't last forever because they're relationships while they may support each other now  are very superficial indeed   School is a hard time  because we all grow physically at different rates and theres so many social barriers going on   A lot of what I'm saying more so relates to the real world  but if you can start applying it now you will be so much better off in the long run   I was quite self conscious and thought people saw me as ugly or boring or whatever  but once i accepted my own identity and started defining my own style  life got so much easier  School doesn't give you very much freedom because your forced to do the same things everyday  This is very un natural to some people like yourself  but it was these thoughts  memories and experiences that were amplified and directed once i got out of school    with that said  if you really set your mind to it  you could be the school captain or the most popular person in school if you truly believed it and put conscious effort into it everyday  I thought it was impossible  but then i didn't start reading reddit and truly seeking knowledge and growth until long after my schooling days  so you're already ahead of me there mate    find your hobbies  passion  don't be afraid to be vulnerable  never stop learning and people will be drawn to your enthusiasm for life   I hope that helps  You can't trick your brain into being successful at something  nor can you create fake successes  It only comes from previous successful experiences  Part of making this actually happen is to actually have success   Great insight  I totally agree with you about this  I think a big part of why so many of us are stuck here is that we are repeatedly faced with challenges that are too far beyond our current capabilities    We are attracted to people that look healthy and have good genes  Those are the ones that are defined as good looking today  It's not fair  but that's nature and people can't help who they are attracted to   As someone who is less desirable than average  I have found that my compassion for others in my situation has increased  I have learned to focus my attention more on other people of a similar level of attractiveness to myself  I also don't just mean physical attraction   While we may be predisposed to selecting "good looking" genes  unattractive people wouldn't exist if these were the only genes that were passed on  There is also huge variation in what is considered attractive throughout the world    Status and Power is secondary to Looks   I have to disagree with you on this  Human behaviour is primarily organised around survival  and social status is a far more relevant predictor of ability to provide safety and comfort than good cheekbones  Unattractive people have the potential to succeed sexually if they have high social status or are willing to leverage the power they hold over others  This doesn't necessarily mean they are the most sexually attractive people  just that they are more desirable in a particular social context   That being said  I would agree with you if your point was that in our society  good looks can help people to attain higher social status    If you're a guy and you're good looking  women will intentionally make it easy for you to get with them if they want to be with you  That's easy mode   We seem to have this same debate every day  but there have been  many  examples here of good looking men who are forever alone  Men with shitty body language  hygiene  social skills  tonality  self awareness  etc can still ultimately be a "no" even if they happen to clean up well for photographs  While looks may be important  they are far from the only factor   As a side note  I don't like it when people here presume that women will always act a certain way in the presence of a good looking man  The notion presumes that women are shallow and lack autonomy  which is deeply sexist    There is no magic words or "pickup lines" that will instantly make a women interested in you  PUA is a load of bullshit  and I feel pretty bad for those that believe in it   I completely agree that PUA isn't magic  but who is actually saying that pickup lines work  There are thousands of PUA coaches out there  and they don't all necessarily use the same approach  Obviously spouting some canned line from the internet won't help  but what about having someone by your side to encourage you or teach you how to navigate new social environments  Maybe certain concepts from sales or public speaking could help you to develop some charisma  Perhaps an outside  unbiased evaluation of your general demeanour would help you to gain self awareness   Of course there are a lot of frauds and douche bags in the industry  but that doesn't mean that the concept of a "dating coach" is inherently flawed    Cold approaches just don't work   Pretty much  for the vast majority of people    The only way that you're likely to find a SO nowadays is through other friends   I wouldn't say it's the only way  but it is a very common way  Similar could be said for jobs and housing  Who you know is very important in many areas    Confidence doesn't exist   I think what you might be trying to say is that people commonly misunderstand the cause of confidence  I would agree with this  if this is the case https   www reddit com r

engineering  I guess that you picked that major because you were also into it   and not a BA or else    You're probably more skilled with that rather than management   Better hire someone qualified for that position  someone who'd be able to create proper human resource department for your company ect    Or learn how to do it yourself  There are infinite resources on the internet or just look up

new people  It takes A LOT of energy for me to have an extended social interaction  I feel renergized after some time to myself  For me  I try to extend my social endurance by having an equal level of enthusiasm throughout the experience  It helps a bit  but ultimately it's just who you are  Just make a concerted effort in these situations to participate  or find an escape route  Good luck This is some solid advice  I really appreciate it   Thank you for taking the time to answer  I hope the holidays were good for you  I figured as much  It's a shame because prior to this event my attendance was exceptional and I worked very hard  Whatever chemical imbalance took place when he switched over my medications was really my downfall  I am not the type of person to just miss work like that  even during the worse time in my addiction     For the three weeks prior I had attempted to meet with the general manager to tell her I was concerned about my increasing depression  but both times she told me she could not make the meeting the day of  Another day I was told the owner was going to meet with me as some sort of punishment  however I was happy because I would finally get to speak to someone about the medical issues  After waiting around all day he just never showed up  completely wasting about 2 hours of my time  I did try to speak to someone on multiple occasions  I got the feeling that they didn't really care and just blew me off every time      On the bright side I can start a new chapter in my life Now that I have survived the holidays  I have to blow the dust of my resume and stay far away from the fast food industry  All that matters is that your heart stays young  There is nothing you can do about your looks and getting older  Keep that silly  outgoing heart you had since you were a child  It shrinks as you grow older metaphorically speaking  You're welcome   Have you considered trying to role play this in a way  You could set it up where she tells you she's going out for a girl's night at a local bar  gets dolled up and heads out  10 minutes later you also head out to meet her  but you act like a different person  use a different name and you her pretend you are strangers  Then you take her home they night and go hog wild as this "other man" having sex with your girlfriend   You could even have her describe to you the next day how awesome the sex was with the "other man " etc  if that's part of the fantasy for you   Worth a shot if you're interested in exploring it  "I hope you outlive your relatives" "You're face makes blind kids cry "Thanks  Your job isn't to be your kids friend  You're a parent and your job is to raise your kid to be a decent human being  Your wife was doing her job as a parent   The three days were not consecutive  A few times I had made meeting plans to tell them I was very concerned for my mental health and well being and they cancelled every time  They eventually ended up saying the owner was going to meet with me as some form of punishment  I was happy because I would finally be able to tell someone and get removed from the schedule  The day they said he would be coming in to speak to me I waited    He just never showed up  not even bothering to send me a text saying he couldn't make it      Not showing up I would expect to get fired  However if I tell management I need to talk to them about why I am having difficulties I expect them to at least take the time to sit and hear me out   They continued to keep booking me overtime and difficult hours  2016 was pretty bad  but hey here's this little peanut of wisdom  https   www youtube com watch v 7VbYokM9dY4 t  Hello  world                                           Two words  relativity absurdity                        Two

up in smaller groups and getting more used to talkingTo me  it isn't that I don't feel like I have lasting impact on anyone  I do  I feel like the people I'm around right now will remember me for at least a little while if I was to leave their life right now   The reason I feel forever alone is that  besides relatives  I haven't had a person in my life be a common thread among all changes I understand where you're coming from  I'm very openminded as to whom I would date for the most part  looks  interests etc   But I have to admit that if I felt we were really far apart on other levels and couldn't connect  that would probably not work out and I wouldn't pursue it    At the same time I feel a bit bad over it  I sometimes get the feeling that people who don't know me well might think I'm "special" in one way or another  Maybe cause of my looks or because I'm more on the quiet awkward side at times  The feeling usually goes away after they get to know me a bit and presumably see I'm fairly intelligent and normal but still  it would suck if some rejections has been a result of people thinking I'm special  That was unexpected but niceBefore trying to get through to your brother first you need to get through to your mom  She seems like she still supports him and defends him and that might have to do alot with you  Your clearly succeeding a lot more than him in life already and that usually scares a lot of mother's especially single ones  They worry that once all the kids grow up and leave that they literally have nothing else to do  She might just be holding on to the moments she still has with him while she can because she's already had to accept that your moving on  If you can get through to her that he needs help and needs a jumpstart in life then maybe you can both sit him down and try to talk to him about his future  Tell him to cut the crap and confront him on all his lies  I know you've been trying for six months already but don't let him just get by with a "whatever I just don't want to get a job or go to school" or whatever he'd say  Sounds like he's using your mom as a source for everything  food  home etc  which really isn't fair and if you can get your mom to say that to him then that should be a clear wake up call  Hope this helps and good luck  Dude you seem very intelligent and eloquent  if you enter a challenging field you will do just fine in the friends department  You can become a Teacher's assistant if they have that at your college   I know that you're looking into losing weight and that should help with the romantic part You sound completely normal  I don't find that your standards are high at all  It does sound like you can't handle rejection well   Hey man  i'm also from Australia  i'm from melbourne  i was really interested in your post  and i'm realising now that i'm writing some kind of thesis  i don't blame if you can't be bothered to read it   also i dont spell very well       Writing that title made me sound like the most conceited person  but I'm not   i wouldn't say that  i read the title and actually got anxiety  that is alot of responsibility at an age when most are in college playing video games and partying in their spare time     This is everything I ever wanted  and it's also nothing that I wanted  I always wanted to run my own company with staff  big revenue  global offices  executives  board meetings  and all that  I always wanted to travel to offices around the world and manage my teams  but it's nothing like I dreamed    The money we're dealing with  exposure  is all a dream come true  but why isn't it what I imagined   Society often instills people with image of a successful person as someone who is rich  powerful etc  as if there is a standard factory model for success that fits all people  there is nothing intrinsically WRONG with money and power  but it's easy to confuse societies concept of success with 'life fulfillment'    Only YOU yourself can decide if you are successful  You might be monetarily successful  but what about relationships  happiness  things people often throw to the wayside in 'pursuit' of riches for their entire lives    The money we're dealing with  exposure  is all a dream come true  but why isn't it what I imagined  We have a global team of over 100 people  offices in 3 different countries  and all that shit  But  it's just so different  The problems seem to outweigh the 'perks'  For example  I bought my dream car  helped family pay off debt  started other businesses  financially free etc   that's all good and well  but is it worth it  It's always a question popping up in my mind   you said it isn't what you imagined  this is a good question man  what did you imagine  sometimes the 'dream' isn't something that is genuine or from you yourself  it's someone elses vision FOR you  something picked up from society  family whoever    my instinct tells me alot of your problems have less to do with money and more to do with your own beliefs and values  and possibly the values your parents have instilled in you  you say your parents have raised you to be 'kind and humble  and to help others' and yet you have a job that may constantly challenges these values  This sounds to me extremely stressful  and a source of intense internal conflict    Nobody wants to hear their CEO complaining  and nobody from my family friends understands  They just think I'm complaining for the sake of complaining   And It can be very isolating to never be able to talk to someone about these things  someone who will fully listen to you without judgement or bias  someone who can listen to you and not just think of you as the CEO  but an actual person  i really get what you're saying here     The biggest issue I feel    I was a very nice and humble person growing up  now  not so much  I am jaded  I am capitalistic  I am assertive and dominant  I go and get what I want  and sometimes I take it  It's as if everything in my life is trying to change me  and I don't want to change anymore  but I have to  The pressures on me are from 50 different directions  and I'm struggling    what is the 'everything' in your life that is trying to change you   yousaid near the start of your post that you 'have everything you ever wanted' and 'it's all a dream come true'   and yet you are typing like a prisoner  someone who has no control  I think this is a problem you should examine dude  honestly i feel nervous trying to give so much advice to you  but i would say that rather then telling you what to do with your business  of which i'm pretty sure you know better then me  i would instead start with looking inwards  a psychologist is a brilliant idea     goodluck man How did she react  As long as you weren't creepy about it  I'm sure it would have been fineI have a Facebook that I use to follow my classes group and help people with homework I just like helping people but I don't use my real name and a picture of my dog  You are not alone  You are not the only one  Please  reach out  I've been where you were are too many times to count  It can get better  You are not alone  Synesthesia is a medical condition where cross wiring of the brain can cause one input to produce atypical outputs  such as emotion to vision or smell to sound  There is more info on this page  http   www daysyn com Types of Syn html  I have OCD as well as multiple types of synesthesia  The most similar experience I have to yours is seeing mental images in response to music Awesome that you have taken a lot from the experience  Also your ex bf is an assI have the same issue with my mom  I'm a sophomore  and I say to her "Do you want to see me at my wedding " and "Do you want to see my children " She gets close to tears when I do this though  She won't quit no matter what I do Holy shit  congratulations  That's fucking amazing  I'm so sorry to hear about your news  Your family might think that you don't really remember him  They should still be supportive though  Big hugs for you  reply if you do and her response please  D You got it I'm so sorry  Please PM if you need to talk  I've been there  Did you wake up earlier  but sleep for 69 hours  What   Anyways  yes  weird sleep patterns can cause your brain to do weird stuff  If you seriously did just sleep for 69 hours  you can get weird sensations like that   anecdotal  but I have severe sleep problems myself and I totally know that feeling you're talking about  Kind of like when you've been on a plane and it feels like you're still descending a few hours after you get off  I guess the same way your body gets itself used to descending  you get used to the sensation of lying down  and then the disconnect between that and reality causes you to feel like you're falling  Not sure though   Less anecdotal  I get this after sleeping for too long  but sleeping for 69 hours is not normal in the first place  I think you should ask your doctor what he thinks it might be  If your exams are seriously stressing you out  it could be that  There are also other things that can cause swings in the amount of sleep you need   anxiety  depression  probably other things  And 69 hours is a big leap from normal   As for the falling sensation  while it may be a normal reaction to sleep that long  you should still make sure that if when you get dizzy  that you get yourself in a safe position  Preferably lying down or sitting down leaning over the table  anything you can do to make sure that in case you actually pass out  you won't fall and hit your head  That's a big hazard you can do something to prevent   All in all  I have no doubt you're going to be fine  though  But I still think you should get a professional opinion  And especially if it happens again   Feel free to pm me whatever you find out  I'm actually pretty interested  oRemind her it's not just her life she's affecting  Do your research on second hand smoke and how it can affect you and the people around her  One day just sit down with her and talk about all this stuff  I'm assuming your still kinda young so ask if she plans on seeing you succeed in life because if she keeps smoking she most likely won't live long enough to see it and that's what every mother really wants  Ask if she wants to one day meet her grandchildren  long term stuff like that  It kinda sucks but you really do need to make her feel as bad as possible but at the same time support her to the max and let her know that if she quits you'll be right by her side for any emotional support  It won't be easy for her and down the road there'll be times where she'll really want to smoke but you just have to keep supporting her and remind her who she's really affecting both physically and emotionally  Hope this helped and good luck  I have a friend losing his hair at age 21 it sucks to go through  Hes friends  parents and other people talk about it behind his back  its really sad The way I see death is pretty much just the nothingness we experience during sleep except forever   Then at the same time there was a nothingness before we were born  and I'm sure you can't recall many memories before the age of 2   Don't worry about what comes after death  we all find out eventually   So let's focus on living  I understand having a family that isn't very supportive   At that point you just have to accept it and focus on supporting yourself   A counselor therapist can really help you piece together what's on your mind   Everything is confidential and they are unbiased  it makes for excellent discussion   You say you work and I'm glad   Having a good work ethic will be key here   I'm not sure what you do or what your plans are but it wouldn't be a bad idea to find a second better job   Building your funds and moving out may be good for you   Friendship  is a tricky thing   It isn't very common that high school friends remain together after   If they haven't kept in touch it could be for any number of reasons   They can be incredibly busy in this new world they are finding themselves in   Also  if you haven't tried contact them yourself then you should give it a shot   No need to wait for things to happen   Don't count on siblings for friends  you are your own person and should make friends based on shared interests values rather than convenience   I highly recommend meetup com  it has been incredibly useful for me in finding new friends   I'm turning 25 soon and it is difficult making friends but it isn't impossible  The key is to expose yourself to new situations and let relationships bloom naturally     Another cliche is volunteering  you can meet a lot of people from different walks of life   Joining a gym could really help in this regard as well   I joined a gym beginning of last year and noticed that you'll see a lot of the same people   I joined classes and socialized with the people that I saw on a regular basis   Physical fitness is one of the greatest things you can do for yourself  the benefits will leak into all other aspects of your life   I know this got long but there's just one more thing   Don't worry about what defines happiness and how long it will last   "This too shall pass "   Everything comes and goes   Happiness  sadness  people  etc   It's part of the human experience   I strongly relate to you and know how hard things can be   With effort  you can make a life that is yours and yours alone   Take hold of opportunities  take risks  make mistakes  learn from them  Take a look at this http   yearcompass com  and objectively look at this past year and take a look at what you want to come next   I wish you the absolute best in your journey  be strong  Thanks for the advice bro  I'll try this Not really friends now are they I vote for be a drama queen   Nobody should get a pass for being such huge dicks   Especially with regard to legitimately dangerous firearms and mental illness   Nope   They're not trying to "educate" you  or "get you comfortable " they're being enormous dickheads Just yesterday I put my kids behind the baby gates and went to hide under the duvet to cry for twenty minutes  Babies are hard  especially when they can start to make their displeasure known  I really empathise with a lot of your post and I can't imagine dealing with all of that on top of your medical issues  I'm so glad you have an amazing husband to support you  I really hope you make it to that next appointment  Remember  you grew  birthed and kept alive a whole human being for a whole year  That's an amazing achievement  now go tell that doctor that that process and all those damn hormones screwed with your brain chemistry  go the er  you might not think youre that bad off now  but its best to get checked out  especially if your necks hurting    its a screwed up feeling going thru something like that  when i was younger  and had only been driving about 3 years  i blew a tire on a hole that was on a dirt road  i lost control and started heading for a tree  but i cut the wheel and ended up flipping my car 3 times in a field  i was okay tho  i dunno how  but i just hit the rear view with my forehead and only ended up with a bruised knot  i went and got checked out anyway  bc ya never know if youre more messed up than you think you are  plus you may end up really hurting later  so meds might help    please go to the er   as a random stranger  im glad it wasnt any worse    Honestly I don't remember a lot of like defined memories with him  But I do remember little things like him buying me my first Furby as  a kid because I begged my mom and she said no  Or him and I running around the house screaming for no reason  But it's just hard  Thank you for your supportHere's what I would do  Give him a chance  and if he says anything racist  dump him for being racist  If he doesn't say anything racist  then this was bad advice because you'll be stuck in a weird relationship with a guy you don't really like  But if he  does  give you a reason to dump him  you might help him get over his racism  It's a really mean way of doing him a favor  but ultimately I think you come out ahead   In the end  OP  I honestly don't think you're gonna like being in a relationship with this guy  You're right  everyone deserves to be with someone on their level  You know that you're intelligent  but you also don't feel that you're worth being with  Right now you say it's because you're overweight  but let me say something here  If you find the motivation to lose weight  you'll still make a reason to feel like you're not worth being with  The lack of self worth is your underlying issue  and being overweight is the excuse you use to cover it up  The truth is you do deserve someone who's worth your time  and it doesn't matter what you look like  It matters how you make others feel  The first step to making others feel good about being around you is making yourself feel good about being around you  Does that make sense  You gotta wine and dine yourself  treat yourself right  like a person worth pursuing  Pursue yourself until you feel good about who you are  and then you can honestly say you wouldn't feel bad about offering yourself to someone else  That self worth is inside you  you just gotta dig deep until you find it I only have a job because I ended up in a really niche industry and it bounced back after 2008  I take it you're not in an Obamacare state  I have a relative who hasn't been able to work in years but her state offers a plan  I hope things turn around for you Do you think the guy could be potentially dangerous or is he just a racist person Yea I think the key is to make her feel as bad as possible but at the same time let her know that you're going to support her as much as possible  I'm sure she'd feel better and maybe more willing knowing she didn't have to do it alone and had you to go to  Depending on your personal dedication on seeing her quit  offer to accompany her to support groups and such  This was a psytrance goa rave  Same type of crowd with drum n bass and jungle  and techno  house not as much   Where do you live  You sound strong  Keep going TagProbably back pain If your in high school  dont  Theres virtually nothing you can do without at least a high school degree that ive come across  even all the minimum wage jobs ive had have required a high school degree at the least  College degrees are becoming the standard unfortunately  but high school is the BARE MINIMUM  The only position you will be in after leaving high school is trying to find a job and once you do youll be stuck between trying to move out and dealing with the repetativeness that is your life  Just keep moving forward  itd be a shame for someone to drop out so early  Alot of the burnout factory workers I've met over the years peaked in high school  and if you leave early you wont even have the "Glory Days" to fall back on even if you dont continue your education after that  Your not going to win the lottery or become immensely succesful overnight  Take your time  work on what you need to and keep moving forward    2 time college dropout here  Still trying to get things on track myself There is a 30  sub some regulars from here hang out there from what I remember  I don't want to downplay the role of personality in dating and stuff  it's definitely important  but I feel it's less important in actually securing a date  It's good for long term stability but in terms of building an initial impression  unless you're deeply anti social or abnormal  most people can get by on attracting people with their appearance  "game " social capital  and interests  I'm not really scoring in any of those areas  Not that I'm ugly  I'm probably average  maybe slightly below  but I don't have game and my social capital has plummeted since college   Friending girls is good for making friends  I had a lot of lady friends in school and some I still talk to now  but it never built my confidence in talking to women in a more romantic or sexual manner  and it's not supposed to    The arranged marriage thing was a joke  even though my dad is from a culture where that is a viable option lmao  My silent hope is that I can meet an FA love shy girl in real life  The thing is like I said though it's not like they wear special pendants or something lol  Simply going to a bar and hoping I get a girl who is inexperienced is a joke too   Yeah I acknowledge I'm pretty hard on myself  but it's pretty common among FAs  It's really hard not to  For most of my life  while I was never hated I just never seemed to fit in while most people have without question  At some point you can't help but feel defective  which can make you feel anything from sad to personally responsible and guilty  You are not alone  I have suffered the same feelings and I'm so happy that you're getting help  Good luck  Apples are like the fruit cousin of oranges Try to make a goal for yourself each week in being more socially active  Talk to one person a day  Talk to one person online a day by sending a dm to someone or commenting on someone's post  Find meetups in your area  Sign up for a class  any class like yoga  self defense  art  whatever that you can go to each week and socialize with people there  You can use a bus  a taxi  Uber  or Lyft to get around  idk how many cents per mile in your area you can google that   You have to download the app on your phone so you can see who your ride is and their license plate  There are websites you can make some cash like Swagbucks and QuickRewards to go to your Paypal to make a little cash  Amazon is the best site to buy cheap phones to call and text friends and you can buy T mobile phone cards for  10 to  20 with free unlimited data  talk  and text  Also there are online therapists to talk to online about your social anxiety problem  There are some vitamins like Vitamin B3  B6  and St  Worts that can help decrease anxiety  They are available at Whole Foods  but you can probably get them on Amazon for cheaper  Even if you fail at an interaction going the way you want it to  keep reaching out and don't close yourself off no matter how you feel  If you have to take a break to yourself that's fine  but closing yourself off for long periods of time   the feeling will just get worse  Hope you get better    It sorta depends where you live  I'm am "that" guy who gets along with everyone and I do get invited to parties a lot  But remember that in university it isn't just the cool kids who throw parties  I've gone to Esports club parties where we watched the world Championships on paperview   they rented out a cinema   Any party is a good party  Maybe you are THAT guy but not quite embedded enough in their social groups that they WANT you to be there all the timeWOW just WOW   It's really amazing to see just what people do for some money   You know  I actually was with your kind at some point in time  I was in dire need of help  Nowhere was stated that "Tough Love" would be the way to treat their patients  And I can only say that I now value you people less than other humans  For the most part  you're not even nice people to begin with   Are you also doing it because you need to let off some steam or something  If so  then there'd be plenty of other ways to vent  if you really have that need      BUT OH  I FORGOT      You don't "earn" any    money    that way  I get it now  Yeah    Wow  talk about disrespectful on her behalf  This is what sucks about high school if i remember correctly  the "adults" are always in the right  The teacher should essentially be like a co worker but a little more authoritative  however  having one go out of their way to share a personal essay with people whom it was not intended for is not only unprofessional but incredibly rude  I wouldnt advise confronting her because then it turns into he said she said  And guess what  then she wins because your just the high school kid that confronted a teacher  Go to the principle and discuss it  I hope it works out for you  Pain is his AstroTurf I think what you did is perfectly normal  Most people  even ones inside relationships  like flattery and attention  A lot of people get touchy feely and huggy when drunk  I know I do   It feels good  and it's a platonic form of intimacy    Cheating should be defined between you and your boyfriend  What constitutes as cheating to one couple  is perfectly comfortable and acceptable to another couple  Every couple has different boundaries and definitions  I personally tend to be very intimate with my platonic friends  both male and female   I tend to hug them a lot  kiss them on the cheeks  and with the ones I'm even more comfortable with  I cuddle with them when we're watching tv together or something  One of my good girlfriends came over last night because she was sad  going through a breakup   and I laid with her on the couch for a long time  while she laid with her head on my chest until she stopped crying    I'm a big fan of innocent  platonic intimacy and affection  and I'm one of those people that just tends to crave and need that in my life  When I'm close to someone  I just naturally want to touch them and express my love for them physically  I get a lot of emotional fulfilment when I'm physically affectionate with my friends  My fiance knows that I do these things  and we are both comfortable with it  He knows he can trust me  and that my physical affection toward my friends stays platonic  and would never turn romantic or sexual   I think you and your boyfriend should have a frank and honest conversation about what your boundaries are  and what you're both comfortable with  And just remember that you don't have to be perfect   you're human  Sometimes human beings do need flattery and attention  I think that's just natural  It's really easy when you're still quite young and in one of your first serious relationships  to put unrealistic expectations on yourselves  Don't worry so much  and have that talk with your boyfriend There are career advisors in the sense of "I've graduated  now what "  but nothing really for my situation  We do have the Taught Programmes Office but students never interact with the TPO  it's an internal admin thing  We are meant to go via our department  who are being entirely unhelpful  I want to say something helpful  I am the parent of a transgender child who has struggled with depression  anxiety  bpd    IT GETS BETTER  I know it doesn't feel like it will possibly will but  hang on  As to this  I have a strong urge make her cry and I hate myself for it  Why do I hate her  I don't understand why I feel this way  I don't want anyone to suffer  and yet I still feel like this     Its natural for you to feel like this  imo  consider that you might be mad angry that she should have could have been a better friend   You might be angry  but you are a caring person and really don't want them to hurt  the fact that you care is the wonderful part of you   Hang on   My child took classes at the next city over community education  clay  art  painting    Those people had no expectation of my child other than how they presented them self at the class  but  passing as the correct gender was always a worry  and it caused anxiety  but they kept working  pushing forward   two steps forward  one step back    I wish you the very best on your journey and there are many people who care  if you can reach out to a support group  i know it was hard for my child too   but there is support for youths dealing with more burdens that the society puts on them then they deserve   And speaking as a parent If we are supporting your transformation  and use the wrong pronoun it's not because we don't care  it has to do with old people brains  and rewiring the words that you have attached to your child for the majority of their lives is hard  I have been rambling  sorry I have ADHD  something else i passed to my child     TLDR the fact you don't want anyone to hurt shows your goodness  hang on it gets better  Tldr My "annoying ex partner" doesn't need or want words of encouragement from me  She's plenty happy with her heaps of social success and tall boyfriend  Fuck The first step on the road to recovery always seems the hardest  Please let the professionals help you  because believe me that is what they  want  to do   You are a good mum  and your husband is a good dad  My best wishes to you all   Thanks  man  The problem is  everything becomes a problem in my eyes when I feel that way  The next day it's over  the next week it comes back  I'm learning everyday to get away from it  to put things together and see through all of this   I think I'm on my way to see things getting better  but there's some bad days in the middle of it  Just gotta concentrate and stay strong  Same here  I'm not memorable  at least not in a positive way  The only way someone would remember me is if I inevitably did something weird and embarrassing I find meditation helpful as well  Its unfortunate that it takes too long to meditate myself back to a better state of mind in order to be social again  You sound like someone who is extremely kind and non threatening  You could have been the only woman in the world who was able to make those guys feel safe enough to be able to share their feelings with you  Not only that  but you were independent and open minded enough to see things from their perspective and recognise their positive traits  I really don't believe you have anything to be ashamed of  People like you are actually quite rare  and    special in a meaningful way   I snooped on your post history and learned that you are only 17  I really don't want to trivialise your doubts and insecurities  but I feel you may have quite a while before you need to seriously worry about being forever alone  I know people here are all about how looks are everything  but I think that's a relatively extreme view  In my experience  women as kind hearted and independent as yourself tend to stand out to the right person  In high school  the right person is probably just too dorky and inexperienced to acknowledge it    Obviously the selfies and such i post online are just of my face in good angles and shit  In real life I'm overweight  I don't really have the talent nor effort for make up  I don't have cute girly clothes cuz they don't fit right on me  And I don't know what to do about it   So you have good angles  You're halfway there  It takes time to feel comfortable dressing for your body type  I know people well into their twenties who still don't know how to dress  and women in their thirties who can't makeup   Of course  I am not even going to pretend that I know how to advise you on how to dress  I do know that there are quite a lot of young women in your position  however    I'm not trying to be rude  I'm only being honest  I don't want children or anything    I'm sorry  but I had to laugh at this  No one is judging you for setting a chromosome restriction for your future boyfriend    I feel more alone than ever now  Listen  I know a lot of you out there may have never had anyone interested in you  Maybe I'm also presuming so much but anyway  Wouldn't you choose no one to want to date you rather than ONLY special people to want to date you  I'm sorry   I'm sorry you feel alone  I have actually had women interested in me  but I tend to have similar problems to you in that I attract people with mental problems  or those who are too insecure to approach anyone else  Part of being a nice person is learning to stand up for your own requirements  I've never regretted turning down someone who I knew I was fundamentally incompatible with  The other part is knowing when to make your move  and that is where I've always struggled   You seem like a very sweet and compassionate person  and I hope things will work out for you in the future   I dont have aspergers  but we seem to share a similar behavior  I force myself to be social but after a while it becomes a struggleOuch Fuck  even more depressing to know   We are providing new year special full body massage  thai massage and ayurvedic massage don by well trained north and south staff hygenic a c room  hot water  steam bath spcial packages also available in Delhi Nah they are much worseYeah there's something about a transitioning of moments that seems to flip the switch  Nothing specific to anyone or anything  but as one moment  no matter how big or small the moment  either  changes to the next  something triggers the change in our mental state    I've dont this to  but on a smaller scale  I used to rave a lot  and have gone with many different groups  I think I've voluntarily left my group halfway through the event when no one was looking more times then I've stuck with the group for the whole thing  Although  I would always eventually make my way back to the group after some time had passed  This happens at large parties as well  Please tell her and search for help  If she has suffered an eating disorder herself she certainly will not tell you ''I told you so''  Please tell her  you don't have to walk this road alone   I have multiple conditions resulting in excruciating pain and I haven't found a single painkiller that lasts as long as claimed   IMO the best one was called ketoprofin which was sold under the brand name Orudis  My prescription pills were 75mg  over the counter were 12 5 and it was absolutely the best   But not because it lasted the longest  it took effect the fastest  It was also non narcotic   Unfortunately  it also apparently caused heart problems     I haven't been able to get it in years   Tl dr   there are hipster pain killers  My favorite is really obscure  you probably haven't heard of it Shitty reality am I right   Ask the same question here to different kinds answer r asktrpYeah my ex boyfriend constantly cheated on me I found out  That's a good idea  thanks    I ended up in the ER for kidney stones    morphine is really nice  Best transition to daylight savings time ever From what your step mothers tells you  it look like your disorder is quite apparent  "Look at you  your nothing"  You probably don't agree that you are too skinny  this is very common in anorexics  I think being open with your family will make you feel a lot better  and potentially help you with your disorder  You've already told reddit about it  and I think that a good first step  I hope that the feedback you get here will encourage you to tell someone you know  If not  why not talk to a therapist  Their the most qualified people to give you advice after allThank you  and yes she's already here as a student Thanks  yeah this situation is pretty similar to mine  I appreciate the input  Post history checks out Yes but at least im a real human beanYup  this is the kind of girl all guys want    I thought I could relate to this post  assuming you were having murderous thoughts about your SO while they snored  And here we are I'm so sorry this is happening to you  that's a tough situation  I'm no expert on any of this by any means  but this would be my opinion  take it as you will    For one  your dad needs professional help  As hard as that may be  it's not just going to change right away  Him being watched by family is a good temporary solution  but won't last long  Honestly I don't even know what to recommend for him  but a professional will be the best solution   As for school  I don't recall you saying high school and since you mention scholarships i'm going to assume you're in college  Scholarships are something that if you decide to keep with school  can make a HUGE difference  even if it's just books for a semester  that money could be food on the plate for a week  or even rent for that month  Take every scholarship opportunity you get and talk to a councilor for any you can get as well   For a job  depending on what your schooling is like  plenty of places take college students  It may not be the most entertaining job  but again it will be food on the table per say  Maybe take night classes with a full time job  or if you don't need the money that much get a part time that will let you work after school or something  One thing that helped me through crappy jobs is knowing you won't be there the rest of your life  so get something that can help put some ground under you   I have a little experience with my dad having worked as a police officer for the past 30  years  our family is starting to notice how much that can really affect a person's mentality  So it's tough to see situations like this  and your family will be in my thoughts  It's late as i'm typing this  so i hope this is all accurate  One more thing is that your family will always be most important  obviously helping your dad get better is important  but making sure other family members  like your mom  are taken care of too  Wish you the best op  keep us posted   Seems i didn't read the first paragraph all too well  my bad Something that works for me is taking time out to actually feel these bad feelings  instead of trying to supress them  You can do it as a meditation practice  where you just sit down to feel whatever comes up  Just remember to accept everything as a 'part of you'  and don't try to run from whatever pops up   I think that this will help keep things in check  as suppression is not really a healthy long term strategy imo  Good luck  Oh and exercise also helps   Yes  You'll turn into a radioactive spider I don't go out at all  unless it is for work A super important point is that often what you know you have to do is very hard to do  For example you might not want to have kids  but others pressure you so you feel you have to  The majority of people will make inauthentic decisions to avoid pain  which is worse than any bad outcome that could come from being authentic i slept for 6 hour lol   im even typing shit now lol     but yeah evertime i tilt my head backward  i have the feeling my body is gonna  i'm having a hard time sitting down and standing up   I wouldn't think it weird since you're the same gender and just doing it to be friends I would be honest and upfront  You don't even have to do it face to face   sometimes it's even better to just write a letter  Do it through email or private message on facebook  Writing a letter is my preferred method of conversation because you can get everything out that you want to say the WAY you want to say it  you don't forget anything or misspeak    I'd tell him that you feel betrayed and affronted because you know that he  knows  you are interested in this girl  and you saw them being physically intimate at the party  Tell him that's just not something you expected from him  and that's not what friends do to each other  Tell him that you wouldn't do that to him  I'm assuming that's true     Then ask him if he likes her  too  Tell him that if he does  you wish he'd have told you  Then  if you still want to be his friend  and wish to fix your friendship  let him know that  Tell him that you still care about him and your friendship  but that you need these questions answered  and that you'd like to work it out I am introverted  but I do want friends  only problem is people are repulsed at the sight of me  They mostly mock me about my appearance and lack of friends significant other  I would happy to have you as a friend Hey  I'm sorry your mum did that to you  At least it was a fairly ordinary conversation  here I was thinking it would go much worse   There will be a light at the end of the tunnel for you  I promise  You have a lot of issues caused by your sexual abuse  have you seen a professional about it  Part of learning how to deal with things like this is to get professional help  You can't sort it alone and nobody in your life that hasn't been trained to help sort it an eitherThat's amazing  I'm proud of you  Can you make the communism connection more explicit  I don't think it's as obvious as you think it is    And just so you know  there are people who licensed psychiatrists have diagnosed with autism and other neurovariations who hang out on this sub  Stumbling onto neurodiversity does not automatically result in hurt feelings  changes in political affiliation  bad decisions  or rejecting the medical establishment   Not saying any of those things are impossible  but the first line of your post presents this as inevitable     Also FYI  Your post has been reported 4 times and marked as spam    We generally avoid silencing people with different political viewpoints  because shutting down dissent is bad for discussion and bad for democracy  However  tread carefully  I'm so sorry  I hope you're feeling better now  How are your dad and your sister  Sounds amazing  I'm so happy for youKottonmouth Kings have an official Facebook page  an official Twitter   kottonmouth   an an  official website  http   www kottonmouthkings com    I would start by sending messages through one or all of those  This is the easiest way to get a message to them  since their publicist like set these pages up  It may take a while for them to check into them though   They are managed by United Family Music  who also have an FB page and a twitter   officialunitedfamilymusic   If you don't get a response from the band's socials then try this one  they're probably more active   Their booking agent is Alex Gilbert  alex arteryglobal com   This is an utter hail mary  Obviously he has the means to contact the band  since he's the guy they use to set up shows  But whether or not he'd be willing to pass along your message is what I don't know Unfortunately there is not a lot of reseach going on  In the past years there was a study in Switzerland by Gasser  in Great Britain by Robin Carhart Harris and David Nut and now these new studies in the states  Apart from that there is not much official research   However there are older studies from the 1950ies and 60ies which indicate benefits for depressions and there are plenty of people  including myself  who have been able to improved their mental state using psychedelics   When using psychedlics be careful about the dose  set and setting and so on  Read all you can on the topic so you have a idea what you are up to I'm afraid I don't have any practical advice about your current problems  What I do know from personal experience is that you will leave the fuck ups behind you as long as you keep going  I'm so sorry that you're having such a bad start to the year and I hope you can get some help with this Go to the hospital  If you are at a point you have to call a suicide hotline because not being able to care for your sick child without feeling like a complete failure  how is doing it again the next day going to make it better   Either that or have your husband take time off work to be with the baby while you go to a family or friends to recuperate while calling the hotline  If you are off your meds get back on   Don't repeat the same cycle and expect things to get better  because it won't  I'm so sorry for your loss  as I like to share how it was growing up as a child with no parents  I lost them at age 5 6  I remind people to cherish the memories they have of their parents  Because I don't have any of mine  Do what you need to grieve  but remember to pick yourself up  I like the flair guy   lol  I don't know if you are seeking advice but    when I begin to tire of a social situation  I usually try to encourage everyone into an activity such as cards  going for a walk  or going shopping  A new activity usually energizes everyone including myself  If you are doing anything for a prolonged period of time    well of course you are going to get bored  However I don't know why you become very apathetic and dissociative so suddenly   I am sorry  If you give up  you'll never see what you can become  You'll never see the wonders that our human lives can deliver  My main motivation in life is to earn a lot of money   You'll want to change that  Studies have found that students whose primary motivation is to earn a lot of money are the most likely to fail and or drop out  and it is negatively correlated with GPA  Could you just say  "Hey  I'm too busy to take that course this semester  but I'll do my best to see about getting signed up next semester "  If he asks why you're too busy just say you've got some complicated family matters going on at the minute that you aren't free to discuss So you saw your friend putting his head on the chopping block  So sad   marriage is about announcing your economic contract of union to the community  so some make the proposal public too It's a dangerous path when we start making excuses for other people's behavior  You seem to have ignored some red flags  and that's fine  what's done is done   But try to take those into account and see her for who she really is  Everything you dreamed of  Did you dream to be with someone who would lie to you by omission  Is the girl of your dreams dating someone else in 5 days  really  Dream higher  Keep things real and good luck  It's a bit like finding a job in this economy and overpopulation   Warning  Horrible spam on mobile Going back to schools ALWAYS a great idea   If not school then just classes  Take a class in improv   those are a ton of fun and you make great friends and become more social and it's like playing games when you are a kid   Either that or join some other club class   Also  if you're not already on Zoloft or something you may want to start  That shit can help and it helped me    Also  exercising  Take a bike ride with your headphones on in some forest preserve trail orgs to a museum   Depression comes from boredom a lot of times and boredom is mostly caused by mental inactivity or lack of mental stimulation    Another thing I would recommend is the book "Zen and the Art of Happiness" By Chris Prentiss  Another one would be "A Manual for Living" by Epictitus     Relax    we all hit a slump at some point where you get depressed  there is a self loathing  a heaviness is there every morning you wake up     You'll bust out of it    Hope this helped I remember at my old job i walked in on co workers talking to eachother  when i first entered in the room they stopped talking and kind of awkwardly looked around   I found out later that day that they were shit talking my hairline   These were people i kind of enjoyed working with because i thought they were cool with me   I was wrong to think these people were decent human beings   Why go out of your way to talk shit about someone   especially when theyre friendly and helpful towards you   I used to try and help people in my life but ive come to realize that people are nothing but fake worthless pieces of shit Yeah japanese girls are notorious for effing white ugly foreign men 24 7 until they are sore  and then they pass them to their girlfriendsjust masturbate it off like everyone else  PWell they already don't speak much English  so that's a big problem already   girls on hearthstone I'll do some of your housework  but I take only advance payment in the form of bjs I'm so sorry  You don't have to be strong for others  grief gives you the right to be selfish  Grieve the way you want  if that's being strong because you want to then do it  if it means curling in a ball and crying for awhile then do that  I am so sorry you have to go through this  unattractive males   despite what feminists scream  it's actually males who have an incredibly varied appearance taste up to the extreme  while women have barely any variation from normal mainstream healthy good looks taste   I even saw on a webcam show a skinny woman with a ton of excess skin on her stomach  she must have lost a ton of weight too quickly  Her hair was short  she was sickly pale  By looking at her you'd have thought she was an ex obese cancer patient with some kind of cancer that eats your body away quickly  And yet there were thousands of men who not only were telling her she was beautiful  but they were choosing to look at her rather than any other free hot girl cam just one click away Ask her out  If she says "No" and there is rejection you are going to have to live through it anyway   But rejection will happen more and more as you grow older   But it sounds to me like she would go out with you  Just be confident and if you haven't got any then fake confidence works good too  No  not necessarily  It depends on the personality of the girl yes  I need a dog I fucked up even worse  I slept with a guy who's in a sort of open relationship  We were super drunk  His girlfriend was sleeping next to us  in retrospect   what the fuck      But now he told me that this was breaking the rules  I thought we did something that was OK  now I'm an accomplice to something that could ruin their relationship    God  they really need each other   To make everything worse  I didn't even like it  It was horrible and and I feel both guilty and taken advantage of  I asked him several times if this was OK for heavens sake  Now everything is ruined and I can't even go to the toilet without it hurting like hell   So  if there's hope for me there certainly must be hope for you  Bs  Confidence does jack and shit for your personality  your tastes  your sensibilities  and jack is out of town  I can't tell you how relieving it is to hear that someone else out there has a similar problem  People often condemn me or call me sick and twisted or tell me to kill myself just for having an uncontrolled attraction  I've never acted upon anything  I keep the fantasies completely in my head  and yet somehow I am just as bad of a person as a murder  Please  give me a break  The world needs to wake up and see that being a pedosexual isn't a heinous crime  It's only a crime when fantasies are actively forced upon real children  Sigh  I could go on about this for hours  How many people do you swipe  You shuold use the chrome autoswiper   Most importantly  what did you do on your first date Learn a language  it can lead to many benefits in the future  help with your studies and increase your employability      I feel exactly the same  That's why I won't reproduce and why I preach returning to the void by voluntary extinction Thank you for the advice   I actually put Rich Dad Poor Dad on hold at the library recently   I will make sure to purchase it now though since it seems like a book I am going to want to read multiple times    I want an Intrinsic Field Subtractor  one can never know   And a very merry  unbirthday  to you  Like you  only in attractive You are doing the right thing for yourself by doing this  Stay strong  May your decisions be supported and everything works for the better for your sake  No you are fucking 17  Everyone think their life sucks at 17  Thats called being a teenager  Thank you guys for the advice   If I were you I would rejoice in the fact you know fir certain what a scumbag this guy is even if nobody else does    And your cousin  I am sure she already knows this guy is a horny scumbag  To grab at a young chick at your Gf's family party is a pretty horny  scumbag thing to do   He has probably tried to bang half of her friends and everyone he works with     Whatever you decide to do  just relax and take a deep breath  It sounds like you are a very attractive woman and you are going to have to deal with over confident  douchebags drooling over you from time to time    Trust me  at one point in life these pathetic losers will make you laugh at their idiocy    This is also another reason why younger girls should get an education or some sort of job training so they are not reliant on alpha male dick heads  Since she's 17  he's asking someone underage for sexual photos  He could get into a lot of shit for that  Report him with the screenshots and maybe get some of the other girls to report him as well Any reason why you didn't get the technician out  Then they can go and check through it all and make sure its all good    Sounds to always be on zone 7  might be worth setting up a camera at the sensor to film all night so you can see if anything is making it go off  and can check for sun   At least then you can see if it is something doing it  like the sun  or nothing doing it and you need a technician to see if some sort of timer on the device is faulty  Plus you'll have video proof of whatever it is This is really not the sub for you Make it out alive In my humble opinion  true confidence springs out from authenticity rather than just pure success  Guys that do nothing but brag about themselves and act "confident" come across as fake at best and douchebags at worst  Granted  some women seem eager to date those types but I guess birds of a feather flock together  Not everyone is attracted to inflated egos with seemingly zero weaknesses  though  It's part of our natural instincts to also seek a sense of empathy in a partner because that's a crucial skill for parenting the common offspring  and there is no sense of empathy without any flaws and self doubt    How the fuck are you supposed to develop if you're failing all the time and you don't know why   But  alas  I don't know the answer to this  I struggle with zero self confidence myself  not that confidence matters much for an ugly woman's romantic chances but whatever   I just think it'd be better to approach this problem by substituting "how can I be more confident " by "how can I be more authentic to myself and people around me "    which  of course  takes incredibly more confidence when you have flaws and weaknesses to reveal than when you have not Are you sure you're not using those opinions as a defense mechanism  At least for me I realized that most of the reason I was an introvert was because I didn't have any social skills  Telling other introverts  and myself  that I didn't want to socialize was actually just somthing I did to avoid the fact that I was scared  As I progress I get more outgoing and now I actually prefer to have plans during weekends   Also   small talk is necessary  If you never do it you never get to know people and you never know who you'll connect with at a less superficial level unless you do the superficial stuff first I'd honestly tell him to divorce  It'd be hard  but I think he'd be much happier with another woman who ISN'T a bitch no offense   Also  like you said  sometimes people act this way because they themselves are guilty from seeing other people  so they try to dig up dirt on other people to make themselves feel less guilty  You will get a higher dose of radiation from walking down to the shops than you will from the cup  its fine The reason I am not interested in getting the tech out is because I'll have to pay for a call out and he will simply replace the sensor   While this might work I'm already ahead of the curve there  I have just taken the sensors from my main bedroom window and swapped it for the ones on the zone 7 window    so let's see    The camera is a great idea but I need something to record onto  my computer and laptop were taken a burglary and robbery ago  respectively  I'll probably only get a new PC around the end of January but I will hook up a webcam for sure  Hi  I know I won't be able to convey much of my thoughts  I'm not a native English speaker as well  but all I want to tell you is I am with you  I was also a survivor of rape by a family friend when I was 4 5 years old  it happened for the whole school year while I was still in kindergarten  Another rape attempt by my brother in law happened to me when I was 13 years old  I didn't talk about what happened until I went to college  I kept things to myself for many years and I had to deal things alone  I was so damn afraid and embarrassed about it that I tried to forget and pretend that it never happened but as I grew older the thoughts or the guilty feelings came back to the point I was blaming myself about why it did happen  I understand the pain you are feeling today but please I want you to hold on  I don't want you to give up on yourself  I hope you seek professional help to talk you out on this  I know they can be able to help you dealing with all these things  Please don't give up  You will not be able to become a doctor  but you will still be able to become a nurse or a nurse's assistant  You know the woman that brings the bed pans in and out of the rooms  Hey  you can laugh but at least it's better than the guy who has to clean the bedpans  That poor sonuvabitch flunked three classes in High School and had to take summer school in third grade     LOL    No  It won't you will still be able to become a doctor    People fail classes in HS it happens      You should go talk to the counselor or teacher and explain the situation  Maybe they can take into account your situation and give you an incomplete or something you can make up    Also  you should really relax a bit  Stop over thinking the importance of stuff  I mean grades are very important and it is really cool that you are focusing on them and taking them seriously at this age  But also remember you are young and should be enjoying your youth a bit more   Stop worrying about the future so much and focus a bit more on the present   You'll pass the classes  you'll get through High School  you'll go to college    Hell by that time you may want to switch your major      It happens    Sounds like you're in good shape  Hope this helps   I am skinny and have puffy nipples and weak small muscles on the upper body  Stupid aromatase   CAs a girl you have much higher chance of somehing happening and ppl being nice and interested in you and doing all the social legwork  Thus its much easier to convince yourself to go out coz once you do you dont have to do anything else  like approach ppl etc   As a guy you not only have to go out somewhere but once you do you have to keep working for something to happen so the motivation to go out is lower I have all sorts of skin problems and skin allergies  both to regular stuff and to medication for skin problems   Well people are already dropping dead in China because of pollution  Overpopulation has been a thing for decades but it keeps multiplying  In 2016 the number of people who was born was more than twice the people who died  CLMAO when i read the beginning i was thinking "Fuck I'm so screwed " and i will most definitely and i'll start by going to a rave part in a month  Well in regards what I want  Online Business instead of current offline job  warehousing   Want to become incredibly social  working on that  Want to develop other skills  eg  music  language  knowledge  etc   So  yeah basically as much as possible  but the last couple of days  I have been doing pretty much nothing  except go out watch some fireworks on NYE     Life for me is basically go out to different places to have coffee  write some random stuff on my blog  read stuff on net  go back home  go to bed  I want to practice stuff   I plan to do it  but I never end up doing it   I am not a hard worker  but want to be one  he's just hating what life on earth is  but for the brain it's just too difficult for most people to hate "nothing   the way the world happened to be" so they hate people   made up gods  etcI had and possibly still have depression  Never let it affect my work ethic  life goals or social interactions  It looks like her attitude towards you stems from insecurity or weakness  possibly her depression and she's taking it out on you  which is a very shitty thing to do and also inexcusable   In all honesty  I think it is very hard to gain back respect once you lose it  If my partner said that to my face  I'd end things right then and there    I would argue that it is extremely important to remember that you are human and  in turn  make human mistakes  Even if it was real  you did not upload it  You clicked it likely out of curiosity  not because it's something you agreed with or supported  The fact that you watched it so long ago and still feel guilty shows that you are a caring person and would never wish that malice upon someone else  Everyone has done something stupid on the internet throughout the years of them using it  You have no one to apologize to  Forgive yourself Human  being   and doubtful at best  You appear to have a sentient consciousness  but you certainly don't appear to have have much classical  humanity  about you China is poor  as in population  and yet a huge contributor to pollution  Green economy leaders are first world countries I was homeless as a young man in Canada a few times  The best thing I did for prospects was to head into the city  You might consider heading into London  where there are more employment opportunities and homeless relief options  Flat rental may be costlier there though  But the single piece of advice that I think might be most valuable is to go to the nearest benefits office and speak to an officer there  They can give you access to resources you will find very useful  including low income housing options  employment seeking aids  and perhaps some financial assistance  I'm not recommending you go on welfare  mind you  just that many people do not attempt to obtain government assistance until they are really down on their luck  Better to get solid advice there while you still have the benefit of a small amount of cash to your name  They will be eager to help someone who is clearly motivated to work and is at their offices primarily for advice and resources This is such a naive way of viewing the world  dating by itself is sociopathic and manipulative by nature   High school  There is a question here that you have to honestly ask yourself  Some people ask it in 6th grade and have it all thought out  some people it hits later on  like in their 30's or 40's  Either way  you're going to have to face it and answer it honestly   And that question is  "What do you WANT to do "  and that means    what do you really REALLY REALLY want to do  You may have to get a bullshit corporate job in pursuit of what you really enjoy to pay off your shit  But just know you are very young     you have a lot ahead of you and you will most likely change careers a couple of times    Also  going to school is always a great option  Even if you are doing what you love for your job  still take classes in things and learn  It will help keep your mind alive and give you motivation    So  What interests you  Right now  what do you like  What would make you wake up excited to go to work every day   What would it take to get that job  If it means more school fine  if it means getting a better job to pay for the school fine    whatever it takes  Whenever it seems I got a lucky break and I won something or I get contacted by someone it's either someone selling their crap or someone trying to make connections to publicize their crap and they have no clue on what they are doing        goes to bookstore     picks up a pile of books and walks towards the cashier     Excuse me  can I ask you a question     Yes   omg  someone who reads stuff similar to mine      Where did you buy that shirt   dies inside If you can't interact with other humans empathetically and without trying to manipulate them  that's your own fucking problem  Don't project your stupidity on the entire species She seemed genuinely surprised from what I briefly saw  I'm just trying to compliment people more often and I don't want it to be weird But how do you even do that  Throughout my entire life  I've always been that friend  The backup friend who nobody is that bothered about  Clearly it isn't them  it's me To add to this  normies need to understand what a mental illness is  I'm not really sure if it part of someone  but it's definitely a real thing   "Just do it" is like telling a wheelchair bound person to "just walk it off"  it's insulting at the very least   Having a mental illness means your brain is disbalanced and that's where everything comes from  Maybe it is shaped by early experiences  but when you're missing something in your brain  you can't really develop it and use it on a whim  When you live your whole life in isolation  you learn to live by yourself  it's a survival instinct otherwise you won't make it  Going back to a tribal hivemind sort of thinking can't be done really  Stay in High School      You want to work in shit jobs the rest of your life  Stay in that fucking High School and get that diploma  And just so you know  you most likely will have to go to some sort of Junior College or Job training classes at some point in your life anyway    Whatever you do  do NOT drop out of school  It is the dumbest fucking thing a person could do and you will regret it  When I start losing my hair I'll just shave myself bald and grow a beard Well he could be out there being eaten or roadkilled  so he's already ahead of almost any other animal lifeform on the planet being with you  I just wish people  not you  would stop buying animals  and adopt instead animals from animal shelters  since buying animals means that someone will breed more to sell them  or capture them if they are particular wildlife  If anyone's a big enough sleaze ball to grab the butt of their fiancee's cousin  which is so many levels beyond creepy and inappropriate   they deserve to get called out  and your cousin deserves to know what she's getting into before she commits to this creep  Give your family a chance  They may be more supportive than you're assuming Aww I do feel as though my lack of interest in sharing hearing opinions is possibly just a way for me to put up a shield  I get anxious about the idea of bringing people into my life  I would  like  friends and a circle of people that I like and like me back  but I find it kinda scary  So maybe I'm just not allowing myself to be liked because I find the idea of people in my life kinda scary Funny how most women like cats  which are disrespectful abusive manipulative non reciprocating aloof animals that use you for food  and on top of that they also dare to scratch the hands that feed them my dog was wonderful  but she died after 15 18 years   oh the fucking irony look who is projecting right now  if you can't fucking discuss without resorting to ad hominem attack then lock yourself up in a basement The only way to know for sure is to email a colleague  or preferably the GM  And even if you've not been fired  you should obviously be looking for work  and complain to HR humans have just a bunch of extra stuff they want and make up problems when they don't have any  while animals can be content with their lifeWhen I say you are a hero  I'm referring to the part where you turned in a family member for child porn  Here's what I'm trying to get across  the stuff with your brother will blow over one way or another  He may never speak to you again  Amy may do this again in a year and he realizes she's partly to blame  Who knows  All I'm sure of is that it will become a distant painful spot in your memory  not the bright all encompassing fire it is now   Your niece on the other hand    you saved her  Being abused as a kid can fuck you up for life  It creates demons in your head that you don't even know are there  You find them when they jump out and scare you years later  It's like constantly being haunted by ghosts that are invisible and weigh a thousand pounds  It's horrible  It creates a feeling of being damaged that you carry deep down forever  It becomes who you see yourself as  It is your reality   You stopped that path for that little girl  You made a choice to alter the trajectory of her life  You have no clue how much you did for her by turning him in  THAT is why you are a hero What's an ACT I'm not rich  but I have enough  I admit it  money is very important to my happiness  It's not enough by itself to create happiness  but it is very difficult to be happy without money    It's wonderful not to have to worry about having enough to pay the bills and rent  It's lovely to be able to buy as much food as I want at the supermarket  I love being able to go out to eat with friends and buy a round of drinks without checking my bank balance  It's fantastic to be able to save money towards my future  It's great to be able to travel abroad and pursue expensive hobbies  Last year I visited Cyprus  Iceland and Spain and I learned to paraglide  It's awesome to be able to buy decent gifts for my family at Christmas and birthdays  to own a car and drive it wherever I like  It's glorious to have a buffer of savings that's big enough that I don't worry about losing my job    There  are you satisfied  I've admitted it  I hope you too can have enough money to be happy one day  OP its improbable  leave it to your destiny or fate  BTW there is an alternative  try searching for them on online sites with topics that interest you  let me give you an example   i am a game designer and i want designer friends so i would search them at E3  animation forums  digital art forums  or i would search them at my gamming institute   so search them at the place where you dwellThe chances of getting pregnant from that are not impossible  but also very very unlikely  Taking plan B to quell your fears wouldn't be a problem  Are you on birth control  If so  unless you have something health wise that makes it a risk  you need to figure that out ASAP  Anyone regularly having sex should be on birth control Non formal words do  however  decrease your perceived level of intellect  "Like  um  well"   try to train yourself out of using them   To increase the precision of your language  choose verbs that convey specific information    "He is really scared of shower curtain monsters" vs  "Shower curtain monsters terrify him"  Use verbs purposefully   it's an easy rule to follow  but improves your communication greatly  They might have been having the same arguments with the same threats for years and years  Remember they are under a ton of stress as well over this cancer thing   I would not worry about it  I know those are empty words that are easier said than done    As far as those worrisome thoughts you got to stop that shit  IMMEDIATELY      I'm fucking serious  Guard your thoughts away from thinking and thinking and overthinking and rethinking all the worst scenarios  None of them will happen and if they do they are never anywhere nearly as bad as you dreamed they were    A quote   "Your worst enemy cannot harm you as much as your own thoughts unguarded  But once mastered  no one can help you as much"  Empty your mind of these bullshit horror stories you are letting yourself dream up  They are pointless and they fuck with your emotions and reasoning ability    Just take it all as it comes  relax and breathe    Sorry your dad has health problems  Just be there for your parents and stay as positive as possible  Treasure the time you have with them and tell them 'I love you" all the time  Especially when your pissed or there is an argument happening  It seems to defuse the situation  I can't offer any advice about single parenting  or parenting in general  since I have not come to that point in my life yet  I will say however that if you would like to move back with your parents  you should strongly consider to tell them your future plans that way everybody is on the same page  Whether they support you or not after the adoption is final could obviously be a crucial moment in your life  You sound like such a kind person  I wish you much luck This joke will never get old I was on birth control last month after the condom breaking episode  but not this month  He was deployed in another country and came home as a surprise  Hadn't stocked up on condoms so didn't have piv sex  But is it safe to take plan b within two months of taking one Having been poor in the past  and now more successful  I think this idea is a little misunderstood   As the other comment says  money does buy resources which does a lot to reduce stress   The thing is  human adapts quickly  The dreams of the past become the present's status quo  If people were always satisfied with just having food on the table then nothing in terms of scientific progress would've been accomplished   Now  poverty is fucking awful  Constant struggle for survival  It's granted very difficult to enjoy anything in life when you're constantly worried about having food and shelter the next morning   Once you get past that though  money provides diminishing returns  Once you own a house  a car and are financially stable  a little extra cash does nothing for you  If you're already able to travel once or twice a year  another vacation doesn't really add anything to your life   The quote I've heard though I can't remember where  a comedian  I believe  is that 'money doesn't buy happiness  but it makes unhappiness a lot more bearable'  I'd say that gets the point across much more accurately I just recently joined a free salsa dance class  which I was incredibly crap at  but still enjoyed it   also going to join a basketball team  social  soon  new season starting this month and I've signed up already   and am currently working on a good idea for starting business  I want at least something that can make me a constant small amount of money from today  and another business that I can consistently work on so it can replace my income one day    One of my plans was to go to as many as social events as possible  1 per day   but my issue with that is   if I did that  I would get no time to improve skills if I spend all my time out   also would take a lot of money Those people that say that shit are people who won't get a job in Communications     You on the other hand should do what feels right and what you are most excited about pursuing    Stop worrying about what the other douchebags say  I went to aFilm school in my 30's and got a degree and I have worked on Movies   Tv ever since   But everyone said it was a useless degree     they are the ones that never did a thing in the industry and film weddings and commercials now     So  don't listen to the douchebags who say you're wasting your time  That's just an idiotic toxicity spread around be people content to fail by never trying  I spent  50 on Aquariam tickets to get flaked on today  Sucks  In my first remotely real relationship of a few months right now  I apologised for probably snoring and was met with something like this    Mention it tomorrow if they know they snore  They'll appreciate that it doesn't bother you and feel all appreciated    I can relate a lot with this feelings as i am myself bipolar  You are a strong person and I am proud of you for admitting you need help  Best wishes OPmaybe 120 was 120 seconds  which probably happened during the poop at all  so maybe he didI think the same  I need an answer  Only with her answer can I move forward  Together or alone    I can't thank you enough for taking the time to read my post  Knowing that there is someone else in the world who would take the time out of their day to contribute to what I had to get off my chest is a truly wonderful feeling  You are a good person and have given so much more than I could have ever asked of you  Thank you   leaves to check news I don't think anything I said means that those reasons can't be reasons as well  Based on what he has said  looks is easily one of the most important things to him  and doing that is dangerous  Even if being alone is one of the reasons  that's equally just as important to acknolwedge that it is DANGEROUS  It's SO dangerous  I was totally harsh in my response  and that's because I've been there and no one told me to get my shit together  and I suffered for it  I don't think anything in my comment SHAMED him  besides the dog thing  maybe  which I find completely important to do because his dogs are suffering and I can't justify letting other creatures be hurt because of something like fear in these kinds of situations   this isn't what this is about  It's about acknowledgement and understanding that this can get worse  And he needs to recognize it  or it WILL get worse    OP  if you feel ashamed from what I've written  fucking don't be  I wouldn't be with my current SO if I didn't think he wasn't attractive  No way in HELL  We're all shallow in that aspect one way or another and I don't think that should be used as a reason to stick with someone who is hurting you SO much    Take it as advice from someone who also thought looks were what mattered the most  and ended up being used by those who took advantage  Learn to stand up for your personal boundaries  and at the end of the day  do what is right for YOU I didn't owe anything to anyone  If you were in my position you wouldn't have gone either Should've invited yourself for New Years   This person sounds the literal worst friend in the world    Paragraph 1 is an obvious sign she doesn't give a shit and if she isn't ever inviting you or asking on your behalf is she really a friend  I wouldn't worry about it at all  But in the future make sure you're stocked up since you seem to worry a lot Okay so I'm guy  2  but only one girl has said yes and that was decades ago when I was 18  One other girl said yes but then canceled and reunited with old boyfriend after giving me the green light for two weeks  My only girlfriends have been ones who asked me out This one is from my uncle who has a bunch of them  our previous one was from the store  It's funny how I tell not to buy me pets but get them all the time  "Do you want a guinea pig " NO  "Okay  here's one " She got sick after a few years and died  The last weeks were torture  I tried to feed her with a syringe but she was getting thinner and thinner  Then my sister in law got me a hamster as a surprise  NO  NOT ANOTHER PET  He got a tumor  and guess what happened next  I got George  It seems like parents try to make me feel not so lonely  I never leave the house  ever  Maybe once a year  I never talk to anybody on the phone  I don't have any online friends  Pets don't help  I wish I could go completely insane and not be aware of anything FOCUS on the present and not on the past  The past happened already  Focus on the present and move forward      However  I guess my advice would only be valid based upon the severity of the past sins   If you like murdered someone and buried them in the woods    My answer would be to call the police  They can help         Hey sorry    I hope I didn t confuse you more  But stop focusing on the past   We all have disasters we would like to go back and change but that can't happen and life moves forward so we should focus on right now  be the best person RIGHT NOW who would NEVER repeat those sins from the past  If thoughts about it creep into your head    make certain you think about something else    even if you have to look at porn     focus on other shit    Gosh I hope I helped  Don't lie about your life  If you don't feel like you have something to contribute just congratulate her on her brags and move on    She sounds awful  Did I mention that already I would've  Even if it didn't work out it's experience  While she may seem more wolf ish than dog ish  releasing her into the woods or something would basically guarantee her death  Dogs are  not  wolves  and are not meant to be in survival mode like that  They are domesticated animals  Please don't release your dog into the wild  Stop fucking drinking     Best advice you could give yourself   What happens in college is the guys you used to get totally fucked up with are people you cut loose after a while because you are sick of their shit     the stories about "How fucked up we were" get old and boring         However  keep drinking like a stooge and you WILL BECOME one of those people in their 40's getting fucked up and repeating the same bullshit stories over and over again with nothing surrounding you but other fucking ex friends of people who also were cut loose by their good friends    Also  I would constantly be apologizing to this guy  Explain how much this is bothering you and how much of a dick you feel like  Do it one on one and apologize a lot   Losing a friend and humiliating them is a humiliating and nasty scar you never get over the shame of      OP sounds confident about lots of thingsAgain   if you're like me you possibly don't believe in yourself and that you have anything of value to offer people  Assuming that's the case it would make sense to not want anyone in your life  Why invite people to see how utterly useless you are  It could be a good idea to work on your confidence  and force yourself to get out there so you discover that people are usually quite nice It's a post factum rationalization   That's all Never did this as strong as you and since a few years it's completely changed  Nowadays I mostly see the flaws in all those 5 10 guys and girls and I'm instantly repelled in disgust  On very rare occasions I see a young  obviously rich  and attractive dude my age overtaking my shitty old car on the road in a new Challenger or some similar nice vehicle and I just think "this guy got the life " and smile  But with most people I just recognize how mundane they are It should be fine You can probably search for this sort of thing about Youtube and Reddit  I'll be sure to stop by and link what I find   EDIT 1  The Art of Manliness   Small Talk https   youtu be IiQA3XSw5UM Covers a variation of the FORD method  Make sure to practice with other people first  Small talk is great way to expound relationships  even non romantic ones  And besides  if you're friends with this girl  you're half way to being her boyfriend   EDIT 2  How to Make Someone Feel Special When Talking to Them https   www reddit com r LifeProTips comments 5lcqv2 lpt request how to make people feel special when  Reason is pretty self explanatory  Caring and being a warm person helps a lot  It gravitates people in all sorts of relationships towards you   EDIT 3  How to Speak to an Introvert as an Introvert https   www reddit com r LifeProTips comments 5ddeoc lpt request how to talk to a introvert when youre  ref search posts May not entirely apply to you  but it has some important takeaways  Insteading of saying "um " "well " "gee " or similar filler words  be silent  It makes you seem  feel  and be a bit more intelligent  If you have issues shaking it off  repeat it several times   e g  "Um  sure "     "Um um um um um sure "  It helps you realize its a bit goofy and makes it easier to break the habit  Also  when prompted to speak  especially in a quiet or aekeard situation  you don't have to jump to a response  You don't have to be constantly talking or listening to appreciate someone's presence Even if they were from Fukushima they would be fine  Millions of people live in Nagasaki and Hiroshima  and many of them are senior citizens in good health  You aren't going to get sick from a cup bought from there  it looks like the entire board commited collective suicide You need to discuss this with an academic advisor or someone similar at your school  The policies and procedures for stuff like this are not universal enough to get you good answers on the internet So you almost beat someone to death  then you raped your girlfriend    I can't imagine why people want to kill you    Definitely tell your terapist about it   In the case of psychosis   things can quickly get much worse  Hope it works out good for you     "how can I be more authentic to myself and people around me "    which  of course  takes incredibly more confidence when you have flaws and weaknesses to reveal than when you have not   Yeah  this is definitely an issue I have  I'm scared of letting people truly get to know me  in case they find out how much of a flawed person I really am  This of course means people never get close to me and I make friends with difficulty  Not having close relationships with people leads to a lack of confidence  which makes me even less able to truly let people get to know me for who I actually am  It's a vicious circle really   Hobbies   I like Toastmasters  but meetup com lists lots of hobby groups   I want to know more of George   I have gone through almost exactly that but possibly for different things   Mines GAD  BPD  Depression and Social Phobia    Anywho  Its hard to offer advice with knowing so little but deffinately talk to your therapist or doc about it   I was put on lexapro for depression and it also helped greatly with my GAD and Socialphobia   I ended up going off of it and I have found that CBT  cognitive behavioral therapy  works wonders   Next time you feel that way take a momment and breathe and then ask yourself  is there really something there or is it in my head   Is everyone really staring at me or is it just me being self concious about        fill in the blank   Take a momment and work through it and rationalize the problem out   Its simple but hey  CBT is supposed to be just as effective as some antidepressants  or atleast thats what my doc told me  so good luck and deffinately talk to your therapist next chance you get  maybe email them or write this out in detail and give it to them before your next apt  to give them a heads up      If I just focus on me  PEOPLE FUCKING IGNORE ME      it's like this for every average looking male How do you get food  Are you hikkikomori and unemployed When it happens my mind gets stuck in that thought  The whole process in the simple terms is that the thought is brought on by something and I begin getting a sense of tunnel vision and like the floor is vanishing under me  Then there's the horrible nausea that comes on and feeling like my stomach is twisting in on itself  Add on to this I go through a panic attack  and my mind is stuck on that 'trigger' then for a while as I have to force myself to focus on something else which can take up to an hour at times   I'm mostly a 'go with the flow' kinda girl  To be honest I don't even know  it's a bit of not being there anymore and just what could happen after death occurs Hopping onto this pretty late  but as cool as those things are it sounds like you might be lacking spontaneity in your life  Dancing and exercising sound great a couple days a week  but what if you switched out one day at the gym or one dance class for spontaneous you time once a week  During this time you could decide to go ziplining with some friends  visit some parks if you're into nature  try new types of ethnic foods in or around your area  explore your locale  take a trip to the city country  even sit inside and catch up on movies  video games  or books you've been meaning to get to  etc   etc  I could make this list go on and on  but just remember that the amount of time we have on this planet is limited  Make use of the time you have and don't bore yourself at such a young age with a loaded repetitive schedule while you can still be active and spontaneous   If your job offers leave vacation and you are able to  you could try to save up enough money to plan trips to exotic lands and resorts  You would be amazed at how much you could see in just a day in another country  This could be something you look forward to so that in the middle of your year you do not catch yourself asking the same question in this post   Life is amazing  Experiences are hard to forget  With so much to do and see  I would argue it is impossible for people to get bored of the great planet EarthI realised when reading your story that I also can remember all non formal social interactions I had in the last few years because there are so few   I was wondering if you too anticipate the conversations you might have in those events beforehand  Anyone regularly having sex should know the risks involved  proper use of contraceptives  and how ovulation works  For 26 year old  there Is quite a bit of ignorance   While it's not entirely impossible  the probability of the remainder sperm making it from the outside of your vagina to the inside  and high up to fertilize your egg is highly highly improbable   A man's ejaculate usually has 40 300 MILLION sperm  10 million sperm mL and you're getting into infertility territory    You said it was wiped off  so the numbers you're looking for is minimal  No worries there  Most outer sperm coaugulates  and dies within 20 minutes in open air conditions  While it can live up to 5 days inside the perfect conditions  ie inside the birth canal  it usually dies quickly being in unaccommodating conditions  So just educate yourself if you're doing something continually  especially if it includes heavy consequences like childbirth  If You knew your cycle  and both of You are std free you could've had unprotected sex with no pregnancy resulting because your egg was either dropped or hasn't left the fallopian tubes And wasn't ready to be fertilized  As risky As that sounds  it's possible  Again  You have to know What you're doing Dude  stay away from this chick    she is drowning in a sea of bullshit drama and she'll gladly take you with her   stop focusing on her bullshit problems  You're not with her anymore  Yes she has a place in your heart but the uncle molestation thing is quite frankly none of your fucking business anymore    Go to see a therapist  start transcendental meditation  go fishing  focus on positive things and flush all the negative toxic drama from this chick and her family out of your head  It's not healthy and it will fuck you up if you let it get to you      There are plenty of chicks out there without anywhere near the drama the you could have a healthy relationship with  But if I were you I would stay single for a while     You need some time to reevaluate and lick your wounds  and purge out all the bullshit  immature anger  It'll kill you  there are many "non fa" who got lucky a couple of times and have been with their partner for a long time  and when the couple breaks they spend years or decades alone before getting lucky againI've never heard anything  and couldn't find anything after a quick cursory google search  When you go to pick it up from the pharmacy  just mention that to the pharmacist to see what they say Exactly  The concept of gaining confidence through positive experiences is pretty simple  but for some reason a lot of people don't seem to understand it  People who've always been confident tend to assume that their confidence is just a character trait or that it comes from within  without thinking about the experiences that shaped that confidence  A bigger issue is that because they had positive experiences  they assume we will too  if we just keep asking out women  we will eventually be successful  That's how it worked for them  so that's how it works for everybody  right For two decades  I have been Guy 2  I'm still a virgin at the age of 48   Confidence comes from an external validation of our internal beliefs  It is based on merit and the results of our actions  External results prove that we are capable of achieving that which we achieved  Once we have accomplished something  that result is hard evidence and one feels confident the task can be repeated  Not only that  but the confidence is often further applied to similar tasks and challenges  In this way  confidence builds on itself and the person who has succeeded sees more success   If I tell myself "I am a great student  I get over 100 on every test" so many times that I believe it  yet I keep getting back scores in the 30s and 40s  all I am doing is lying to myself  The results do not validate my beliefs  and no one would seriously say "well  all you have to do is believe stronger to get the results" and no good teacher would say "well  since you believe that you get over 100 on every test  I'll give you a 100 on this test " All the self talk and pseudo faith would not raise my scores one single bit  You do not legitimately get a score of 100 on a test just because you believe that you will  no matter how sincere that faith and belief is   People who are blind don't suddenly see just because they believe they can see   And in the rare cases where they truly believe they can see  it is a medical condition called  Anton Babinski Syndrome  https   en wikipedia org wiki Anton E2 80 93Babinski syndrome    Telling me that I need to have more confidence is like telling people who are blind that they are not really blind  they just have to see  even to the point of using people with Anton Babinski as examples of how to be confident that one can see while blind  and claiming that eventually that fake vision would transform into true vision   Fake confidence often comes across as an "I'm better than everyone else" arrogance  instead of someone who humbly knows from past results that they are capable of completing the task set before them   Women are extremely good at cutting through bullshit false confidence  No matter how well I present myself  no matter how well I was coached  no matter how many times I practiced what to say and how to behave  it failed or backfired  If a woman doesn't want to be friends or have a relationship with you  she will either outright tell you from the start or give you excuse after excuse for why she can't  Forgot to add this but heres some info about cbt  might want to ask them about it   https   youtu be 9c Bv FBE cMaybe talk to people first  and compliment them during the conversation  Just complimenting someone you don't know might come across as a bit creepy Thanks     I have personally been told that PTSD is a lifelong disorder that can only be treated with coping mechanisms but not cured  I use medicine and therapy and it's helped with my symptoms but I won't be able to function without those things for the rest of my life Also  I imagine that the ability to maintain obese in a social situation exists on a spectrum  In other words  even "normal" people cannot be social forever and are limited by time  energy  etc  At what point does it become pathological  In my case I know it is because other people point it out and because I'm limited by it socially Try social dancing  Take ballroom classes and watch your life improve Perhaps it is the shoes and not you  How long has it been since you have gotten a new pair of shoes OP In my experience smokers generally understand the risks and that it's detrimental to their health  As a result don't take well to people "telling" them to stop  By all means though  a casual word to show your concern will at least let him know that you care  Talk to your local council for advice and assistance   Check out gumtree for people looking for a lodger    Go to the job centre to get advice on employment  Or a local college if you want to complete your education  and see if they have any monetary support options   If you're no longer in education  I'd suggest trying to get on an apprenticeship scheme   If you have some gcse's or a levels perhaps try some job agencies too for temp work   Ideally you'll want to gun for university if that's an option   and there's a lot of financial assistance available   talk to their bursary office  I think you could be right that your mother might be cheating  it is a symptom of people doing that to blame the other person to take the heat off themselves    But  until you know that for certain there is nothing you can do about it   Sounds to me like your mother could use some help emotionally and mentally   Is there any way you guys could get together and explain she is delusional and needs help   Promise her it would make her and everybody else happy     I mean   who knows      But the other option is for your father to just divorce her and move on    Also  if your father is watching porn and meeting other women    more power to him    It sounds like he could use some decent porn Wear full gear into the shower This is rough  I'm so sorry you have to go through this  I don't know all the context of why you broke up and all that so I won't start to presume  I know you would have done anything for her but unfortunately that's not an option anymore and it sucks  I really hope things get better for you mate  I'm in a similar boat to you and it hasn't got any easier for me after 3 months so I know how difficult it is to see anything else Hey dude just remember first and foremost  your dad will just want you to be happy and do well in life  I'm sure he is an intelligent man who would understand that you can't take him around the world and tick off a big bucket list as a 20 yr old student  but he wouldn't be fussed by that  What he would want is your emotional support and you to do your best in life and see where that takes you     One thing is for sure  cherish every moment you have with him from now on regardless of how much longer he is with you  When you've written ' I want him to really enjoy himself no matter the outcome and for him to understand that he is very much loved '  don't feel bad that you can't heap him with expensive presents and trips  All he would want from you as his son is love  support and spending some time together and you can always give him that      Wish you guys the best  I know I'm an internet random but I'm always around for a PM Just wanted to share how similar our stories are  Overdosed on citalopram in January last year  currently on fluoxetine and feel a lot better but still not perfectOh god I remember this feeling like it was yesterday  Excruciating  bewildering amounts of pain  then just a tiny amount of morphine went into the IV and it was like someone had just flipped the switch for the pain to "off"  I was just a normal person again   Shit is spooky YesYeah  and forever sever the relationship  Hmm   I got this same tip during therapy  Did'nt really work for me  but that does'nt mean it won't work for you Read  Write  Practice  I think she is being over the top  When I think of my new years  at two minutes past friends were still hugging  saying happy new years  celebrating  Had I have rushed off to send a text would have completely ruined the moment  She is having no understanding that you were actually with other people in another context  She's thinking quite selfishly  You have done nothing wrong  15 minutes would be reasonable to start to feel a little disappointed  And I mean a little Are you still in high school  Your parents aren't angry at you because they hate you or anything  I know it can be hard to realize but your parents obviously want to spend time with you  which they can't really do if you are playing games 8 hours a day and spending the rest of it at school or sleeping  Heavy gaming whilst at school can impact both grades and health in a negative way  as addictive and fun as they can be I think your parents do have a point and perhaps you need to cut back Sounds to me like she could be suffering from some lingering postpartum depression  I'll admit  I get this way with my husband sometimes  and our son just turned 2 last month   When I get that way  it's because I'm not thinking clearly  I'm barely able to think 2 minutes into the future  let alone a whole day  I realize that the house is a wreck  I'm exhausted  but I have to go to work  My husband can be pretty lazy and a bit of a slob  so the messy house doesn't bother him  but I get upset because he doesn't notice  What I'm really upset about is that he can't read my mind and that his standards aren't mine   Maybe try to talk things out with your wife  Try couples therapy or individual  Either way  it sounds like you guys aren't on the same page emotionally You would be much better off asking this in r fitnessThank you  She's mentioned the possibility of me having depression multiple times and has told me  as well as another mental health professional  that medication would be beneficial  Unfortunately  I can't take said medication due to familial issues  I also have trouble because this tends to come in weird cycles  like my depression   She has mentioned CBT and has already started telling me to kindof look into it  I just tend to get really freaked out about it when it's at its worst  because much like last night I don't sleep at night and end up staying up because of this weird paranoia feeling  I'be talked to my friends about it and they don't know much on it so they can't provide a lot of advice  But thank you again  It'a honestly helped me feel a little less afraid and I will definitely look into it  Not much more we can say except you need to make an effort  and no it wouldn't be weird to message those people after time has passed  c'mon man they wanted to help you out  They would most likely appreciate you messaging them back        Always here if you need a PM mateFamily disputes are the worst  thank you for your kind words Very interestingly  yes  Especially if you are different that the people surrounding you  It shows that you are willing to display yourself in your tastes as opposed to someone else's in search for cheap validation  AKA confidence  And people like confident individuals  Read up on Ralph Waldo Emerson and "Self Reliance " Being yourself independent of others' deconstructive criticism is a major social asset He's in emotional pain right now  He has got to get used to rejection     and it is not easy   If he tosses back a few drinks  fine  If it starts fucking up his life     then you should worry yourself  But as of right now  he's fine  He has just gotten a huge chunk of life to chew on and it growing up    Also  these "rejections" happen to all of us all the time  You do get used to it so it doesn't feel as big a personal  heartbreaking insult  But the only way to purge that immature heart ache shit is to live through it  You never know  He may meet the love of his life at a bar    Why did you go to a different doctor if your sister is board qualified to determine your prescription     Or is your sister not an eye doctor    Get your glasses  If you don't like your vision after wearing them  go back to the doctor  What do you want  Do you want a healthy relationship with your gf   If you were single  i would say go for it  And Hop out if anything goes awry  Keep at it if all parties involved are enjoying it    BUT  You have a gf    Would she be ok with this  Have you talked exclusivity and boundaries  If you do this with them  and say nothing to your gf    And you're not in an open relationship as far as she knows  you're a piece of shit    Let me phrase it in a way you can understand  Why be in a limiting thing like a closed relationship  when you can be single  with multiple FWBs  and threesomes with hotties  as you put it   Don't be a scumbag  Talk to your gf about the offer  respect What she says  and decide What you want  Don't do anything behind her back  But If she opposes  you can choose to love and respect her  stay with her and only her  you can lie and have your way and hope she doesn't find out  or you break off the relationship and do ss you please   But you can't have both unless you want to become a piece of shit indeed  Can you really not think of anything to ask that interests you  Maybe you're not of a really curious nature  I think that a lot of the time when I have conversations with people and I ask questions it's really my curiosity speaking  especially when I don't care about a person much       For example  recently I was changing career paths and I was trying to figure out what job I'd want to do  Cue me having conversations with people about what they were studying in their career to learn more about different jobs  I must have sounded really interested in what they did but in fact it came from a selfish desire to get more info       Now though I think that it's pretty fun to have that kind of conversation with people regardless so I tend to still do it  I guess I've come to enjoy it       What I'm saying is that if you make an effort to actually ask questions and try to be interested in other people maybe you'll find that you actually enjoy it more than you thought  I'm constantly baffled by how much more I actually care about other people than I thought I did  I mean  back in high school I was way more cynical uninterested in other people but as I've broken out of my shell and actually had more interactions I realized that a lot of my preconceptions about myself other people were wrong  That's what's great about putting yourself out there and learning about the world  you learn about yourself as well If I could hug you I would  It will get better  I promise   Oh my gosh  I can relate so much to that  I'm so sorry this happened to you  I know how it feels to do something without thinking  and have it turn out being a complete disaster  Heck  I can think about what I'm going to do in a certain situation for an entire year  and still have things turn out horribly  Think about things that they did for you that you really appreciated  Don't take out your emotions ON your friends  not to be misunderstood as talking about your feelings   Tell them that you appreciate them and their help in the past and present  Be there for them when they need you Solid  straight forward advice  although a little general  I'll keep it in mind  I'd rather not go into specifics unless it's beneficial on my behalf  sorry  Apart from keeping a fresh mind  how can running and reading be beneficial She sounds like she has attachment problems  like she's very insecure in your relationship and needs constant validation you love her  It sucks because she probably doesn't realise what affect this is having on you as you're clearly trying to make things work with her  I'm wondering if anything bad happened to give her these trust issues with you  either in this relationship or in the past  Unfortunately I don't think there's anything you can do to fix things  it's just one of those things that she has to work out on her own  You're not in an easy situation here  I'm sorry to hear about your situation friendSounds like a habit  i would suggest choosing something to chew with as a distraction like gum Parents buy food  duh      hikikomori  a person who avoids social contact  I don't avoid it on purpose  I'm just too depressed anxious to do anything  including going outside or working  I'm dying from loneliness The Japanese Ministry of Health  Labour  and Welfare defines hikikomori as people who refuse to leave their house and thus isolate themselves from society in their homes for a period exceeding six months You get to learn  move on and try to do better  This is only a page in your book  it doesn't have to define you  Don't let it She's not a doctor    she just saw and was like shit ur blind    I thought about it but    shit they're expensive from where I am from so I need advice on what to do Thank you for the advice  much appreciated  I'll try to inform myself of any all my options before making any real decisions Wtf do you mean by how is reading and exercise is benificial   DudeHe also goes by the name Joe or Joseph  they all sound similar to him  Latest trick I taught him  he climbs on my foot  I lift him up a few inches and he chews his treat in the air Thanks   He does know I hugged these guys from my group  I told him  and I did tell him that while I like them in a friendly way like they're fun etc and drunk hugging attention seeking is fun  I love him more than anything in the world and he told me he loved me   Also  it was all new to me because we had been together for 10 days and it's my first boyfriend but now we're 3 months together and going strong    We did define the boundary for cheating  we decided that it was a kiss on the lips but hugs kisses in other places  well not sexual  were allowed  Again  thanks for your advice    He sounds like a fucking scumbag  you need to ditch this guy All of those plans are good  just gotta keep going with them   no other mental disorder  I've got tons of them  Hikikomori is not the right term  Maybe nutjob  I have no social skills  but I am still relatively confident  that means I am not afraid of showing what I am Thank you so much for helping me and giving me a real answer that makes sense to me i should start thinking about the "if i dont want to hang out with myself why would anyone else want to hang out with me" and also the part where you spoke about the dymamic of your and your friends relationship made me think that this might be the case  But either way ill just keep on working on bettering myself in order to become a more interesting person to converse with thanks again Have you spoken to any foster agencies yet  See if their are any groups or agencies around you could speak with  they may be able to answer questions and explain the process Thank you for your concern  Is this advice for food on the go or cheap food to make at home  Regardless  I'll keep it in mind    I think I'll check out  r personalfinance and see if they can shed any light on the situation Wow    I do believe your friend has some sort of a personality disorder  I was ready to chalk it all up to immaturity  how old are you both  From the clues in your post  I'm guessing teenagers       but given what you said about her telling you you're ugly  then taking it back  then telling you that more people would care if she died  instead of you  or did she mean that more people would care if YOU died  Not sure      I really do think she has some sort of personality disorder   I think she probably does really love  or at least care for you  but whatever mental emotional problems she's dealing with makes it hard for her to treat you well at all  The things she's doing saying to you and other people show me that she has very little empathy for other people  evident of narcissistic personality disorder  borderline personality disorder  or sociopathy    my guess is on borderline personality disorder  Look up the symptoms of borderline personality disorder  and also narcissistic personality disorder  and I think you'll find many common themes  and also may give you some clues into WHY she is the way she is  and why her mind works that way     And just remember that if she can't change  and continues to treat you like this  then it's perfectly acceptable to end your friendship with her  Not out of spite or bitterness  but just for your own mental emotional well being  I've been in friendships like this  and they are toxic to your mental health and self esteem  You don't deserve to be treated like that  personality disorder or not  You sound like a good friend  and deserve to be valued and treated well  will kindness  compassion  and respect There are horrible people in the world  some of us happen to get born to them   I am so sorry honey A look of haughty derision works for me I dont agree with your objective list  For religion you included atheism but excluded islam and catholicismI'm 33 and live with my family  I love it here  but I have lived other places  I lived in Florida for school  then moved back home and had some apartments and moved around to the east and west coast and back  Home is where the heart is  I feel grounded here  I feel blessed  Sometimes I feel like a weird loser because I am in my 30s and live with my parents  but I work and do have goals  I just can't really afford to move out yet and I'd rather not be alone Can relate  Whenever I tried to make friends or try to have a genuine conversation with someone I feel like they're giving me signals that they have to be elsewhere or with someone else  Even here on reddit  I barely get any kind of interest  Sucks that my life isn't interesting or exciting enough for people Honestly she deserved someone to tell her these things  people who are cruel deserve equal  I hope you are okay and things get better for you  your Dad and your little sister No  not at all  You are strong  you are brave  You are your own man abd you are not defined  by the actions of this horrible peace of shit  Stick with a set sequence  Practicing the same poses every day repeatedly is a powerful way to keep consistent with your practice  This repetition offers you a clear vantage point from which to watch yourself grow and change  The nature and sequencing of Ashtanga Yoga offers this beautifully  You dont have to think about what pose you want to do next  so instead you can focus on your breath  bandhas and drishti  This takes you into a deeper meditative and focused place  so that you will step off your mat feeling more present and peaceful Thanks for the advice      Granted  I didn't say it  but I haven't sat down with them yet  I'm just gathering ideas so I don't get blind sided or even ask too much    If you think I'm asking too much maybe you could  I dunno  say "Your asking too much  insert advice "    This is r advice right  Or did I stumble into AskReddit  Considering posting this question  reading resumes or even posting your own over in  r resumes    Yeah  what makes you think it isn't  Sexual harassment  is  something serious  I mean I've could've done worse things  but that doesn't make it any better Well  talking about it helps  Writing this helped  Thanks for listening  Sometimes our instincts get the best of us  unfortunately  Oh fudgenuggets I thought I did good with my single 36 and overall 33    Goddamn way to go  You earned your bragging rights  I've never thought about it that way but now that you mention it  it makes sense Cats   ChadsI feel this way too  When I told my psychiatrist  he said "Of course that's how you'd feel  you've got anxiety " No  it's not weird   I do it often   It's pretty acceptable  if you are all in a group chat to text others in that chat directly   I've never found it weird whenever somebody does it to me   I'm so sorry for your loss  You need to do whatever you feel is right to grieve and fuck who tells you otherwise A test in the US that colleges look at for entrance  Ace the ACT and you can get into most colleges  My brother got a 34 36 way back when we were in high school and was accepted everywhere he applied  I never took the ACT  just the SAT  which is different but has the same purpose Being a basement dwelling drop out is not going to magically be "less stressful" or make things better with your family  It will actually do the opposite I'm sorry that happened to you  Your best friend wasn't being a friend when she catfished you  so you need to either cut off or severely limit your interactions with this person Have you talked to either of them yet  I don't think you should feel bad about it  you have done what's in your power  The person who lied and  sort of cheated on his GF is him  You  have been  taken advantage of   But hey  2017 can only get better from this point   There are many other types of fish in the sea Hello OP    I know it might not seem like it  but you're incredibly strong  The fact that you're admitting to and getting help for an illness often perceived as shameful shows that you love your husband and child very  very much  and want to be the best mother and wife you can be  I would like to share something from my own life   My mom was in the exact same situation as you are now  I was born just 17 months after my older sister  and the stress that comes with caring for a toddler and a newborn flared up her bipolar depression to a point where she considered ending her life  just like you   She loved my sister and I very much and she wanted to be the very best mother she could  but she didn't get any help until her and my dad divorced  At the time I was maybe 3 4 years old  my sister 5 6  and we knew that mommy was very  very sad sometimes  Our home life wasn't the best as my mother self medicated when she was depressed  but she truly tried her best to give us a normal childhood   She decided to get help after an episode of severe  crippling depression and suicidal thoughts  and she later told me that my sister and I were the only reason she kept fighting this awful illness  an illness that threatened to take away my mother  a mother so dedicated to her children that she  despite the overwhelming stigma and shame attached to bipolar depression  any mental illness really   got the help she so desperately needed   It was a difficult and long struggle  but she worked hard and tirelessly  and with the help and support from friends  a great therapist and medication she got better and took control of her life  something her illness stole from her    Get the help you need  It won't be easy  but you can't go on living with a warzone in your head  emotionally torturing yourself  This merciless illness almost took my mother and my childhood from me  but it doesn't have to end like that  You're not alone  your suffering doesn't make you weak  and you can get better  No one can take the first step to recovery but you  sameA lot of great advice here  tysm  I have some A levels and GCSE's  university has never really appealed to me so if I am presented with a choice I'd rather work  but I'll keep it in mind for sure I've had a few near death experiences and they resulted with me having a few existential  crisis here and there   It helps if you just sit back and focus on the moment  I try art therapy or some phone games like stack or loop   Worrying about what will or can happen is irrelevant  All you can control is the present moment he didn't think much past his feeling of bitternessUnless he  or she  isn't into girls      Where are you based  Why kind of products are you going to sell  What's going to be your focus I don't think my wife thinks my snoring is cute  But she tolerates it and doesn't complain about it much  and I guess that's about all I can ask of her     As others have said  this is not your fault   That being said you have two options as I see it    Either you keep quiet and hope it doesn't happen again  which is unlikely since you haven't done anything yet he will think its fine   The other option is to tell your cousin  This is the route I would recommend because whilst it may sour your relationship with your cousin temporarily  it tells the fiancé its not ok plus it will mean your cousin keeps a closer eye on him  Once a slime ball  always a slime ball  I guarantee this isn't the first time  I sincerely you get the opportunity to move away or cut these poisonous people out of your life  Don't pay for it  It'll be a wake up call that she needs to get her problems in order instead of threatening suicide and having meltdowns in public for hours I'm going through something similar except im the friend who is losing interest  I'm trying to hold onto this friendship but its only making things worse   My suggestion is to let it go and if its meant to be it'll come back  Hang out with other people or join some clubs  It's not a bad thing  its just a part of growing O O wow haha make sure he doesn't choke  C   the idea of the hamster noticing the sound of the fridge with the carrots in them is so sweetmove out asap  since there is no proof that you paid him  he'll probably do it a couple more times  Cheap food at home   There are also a number of personal finance blogs I found useful   I haven't checked them again for several years though  not sure if they're still active   like thesimpledollar   Can't remember the other ones    but they discuss tips for saving  budgeting  how to pay down debt  or better yet avoid it in the first place   Basically  spend less than you earn  Finally lost my FA status at 34 in 2016  My way out was by making a lot of close friends  becoming a very socially active person with them  and finally one of them brought a coworker out with us and she and I hit it off  We've been dating a couple months now  spent New Year's together  and we are going away for a weekend soon so it does feel like things are going well    And if people tell me I wasn't FA because I have a gf now  they're idiots  I was a fucking kissless virgin until 34 yes  that's why kind men are fucked  but not in the why they'd like  In my country males are really fucking aggressive for no reason and women act extrafeminine for no reason and do shit tests all day and you're supposed to tell them to fuck off but    why   why can't be all kind to each other and have sex after respecting each other  Nice to see local folks  I live downtown Ville MarieSecond the workout  my anxiety is palpably different on the days o don't work out vs the days I do How come you ended up in ER for kidney stones It's no problem  Accidents happen  and I'm always willing to listen to a post like this  Mostly because this is  unfortunately  an accident that society is not easy at forgiving  Then again  when is society forgiving  I swear  sometimes it feels like you have to be perfect in this world Do you exercise  Daily or every other day workouts can help with depression and also with increasing appetite  Twatwaffle  cuntwaffle  asshole  Take your pick     Lots of hugs to you I was in the same situation as you in my mid teens  I had a group of friends who were a year older then me and then also a group my age  I too found it stressful trying to balance my time between the two    The solution to the situation is to take a different perspective on it  It doesn't sound like at the moment you're choosing what group to hang with based on who you get on with better  it's more showing your face to hang out to impress the group that you're with them over your other friends  This will drive you crazy    The best thing to do is to make a conscious decision on the said day of what you want to do  Group 1 going to the football game and you don't like football but group 2 going to the theatre and you love the play that's on  Go with group 2  Say to group 1  really sorry but I've got plans  will see you guys next time    If you feel neglected by one group you could also invite them out sometime or say 'you guys up to much tonight '    Or you could encourage your neighbourhood friends to hang out with your friends from class  Bring them to the next event you go to    Be open with them that yes you do have multiple groups of friends but you value them equally  Just because you spread your time out doesn't mean you prefer one group    True friends wouldn't ditch you because you've got other mates    Best of luck  Thanks for your answer  This is what I am thinking of having as well but I don't share a lot of the stuff that other disassociative depersonalized derealized people share  It totally feels like an altered conciousness or a state where you don't have a mind or something like this  I find that the majority of people I am with  I just don't care enough about what they have to say to have a conversation   This isn't necessarily a bad thing   I find small talk to be tedious  and it's generally pretty worthless   A sad reality of our reality TV generation is that most people don't have much of  substance  to talk about anyway     I don't actually care about the answer  you know   This may reflect a certain lack of empathy with others   Depending on the extent  that  could  be a problem   That social contact you see in films is contrived and empty   When you see it play out in real life  it's just as contrived and empty     Have you tried surrounding yourself with people with a common interest   Do you find yourself being engaged by people discussing ideas that interest you   If not  maybe there's something deeper to probe   However  if you enjoy being around like minded people  then seek them out   Where is this from No need to worry I know what you mean but I mean how is it significantly beneficial to my situation Spareroom co uk  Though it's possible to get your own place  it'll eat your money up " whatever you do  don't follow the light" was said to me  I'm always up for a chat  PM me whenever you'd like   Nothing you did was wrong  You don't have to blame yourself  That guy was just a fucked up piece of shit  You encountered real evil  and you survived  You can forgive yourself because there's nothing that needs forgiving    The funny thing about repressing thoughts is that oftentimes they become much  much harder to ignore  If you can accept that it happened  just let yourself feel whatever it is your body and mind wants to feel to process it  it might help you  Your body needs to reset after such a difficult trauma  you can't ignore a broken leg  and you can't ignore depression    You could also ask your parents to set up an appointment with a therapist  You don't have to tell them why  exactly  but being able to speak openly about it with someone will do wonders for you  You wouldn't feel like you were living a double life full of secrets and lies  for one  Most commenters are telling you to improve yourself  I want to give the opposite advice  Stop improving yourself   I don't know anything about you  but I believe that you are smarter than 90  of people  Do you really think filling your head with more information will help you  Do you ever notice how people that never read books after school are able to beat you at arguments   I have to go off my own assumption  but I assume that you care too much in most situations  This is reflected in how you don't settle on a good enough word to make your point  Instead  you struggle for the perfect word  This may be one of the reasons you don't speak fluently   In my opinion  your issue will not be corrected by improving yourself  You'll get better by letting go  You've read more than enough to be good conversationalist In a sense you were a backstabber  but you did it out of concern  He was is in a lot of pain and you abandoned the friendship when you refused to accept his apology    So what's different now  Do you plan to apologize for anything  Do you want him to apologize to you   Nobody here can tell you if he would like to hear from you  but if you're doing it out of genuine interest and concern  give it a try  If it's to stroke your own ego and tell yourself what a kind and forgiving person you are  then don't bother I usually write down things ahead of time that i want to speak my doctors about  like a big long list of all my symptoms  It can also help you come to terms with things yourself and what you want to change   I wish you the best and if you need someone to talk to who understands  message me  I can understand that  For me  it's hard to understand her side of things  I want to make things work and I want to do whatever it takes to make it work  She claims that she tried and that she's tried harder with me than with any other guy  but she just doesn't think we can work together for reasons that don't make sense to me  It's hard to be in a position where you really want it to work  but for some reason it just doesn't seem to  Did you ever try couples counseling  I wanted to suggest it  but knowing my ex it would have been a hard sell  She isn't big on talking about her problems or dealing with them  Sell and spend your time relaxing in a forest lodge  a beach side house and a greek villa for the rest of your life Try an app like Meetup   Find activities in your local area with people in the same age group   Build your network of people   Some that you meet will fall away and become nothing   Some will remain in the acquaintance stage  and a few may become close friends You can't do anything legally to prove you don't owe it  This is why rent books are a thing if you pay cash   The only two options you have are to pay it and use a rent book from now on or move out to a new property and tell him to get fucked  lol xDThank you Did you lash out in anger or did you just leave the ball in her court and see how it goes   If she decided to be a flake  then she's a flake   No big loss Thank you so much for your kindness How are they different  And why is the scaling so low  up until 36  Well  at least you aren't ugly   I can tell you from personal experience that it gets horrible sometimes   A lot of people  myself included  are in debt after college   It only gets worse if you go for additional education after that   Basically  what I'm saying is while those things may help you get dates  they aren't the most important things for maintaining a healthy relationship   They also don't matter to some women   I personally wouldn't automatically deny guys over something as trivial as how much money they have   I want a partner not an ATM   Typically  if you have friends that are women  they will let you practice asking other women out with them or give you advice on how to go about doing that   They could also give you ideas on what some women want in sex relationships  which you could use to your advantage   I'm fully aware that it was a joke   I'm just saying that even though you long for a relationship  not all relationships are happy and fulfilling   Sometimes it is better to be alone than to be in an abusive relationship   I know what you mean to an extent   I'm a hopeless romantic  and I really want to find a guy who will just love me for me  even though I know that's impossible   Maybe you could try Reddit forever alone women to meet someone   Typically  the type of girl you say you want will not be hanging out at bars unless she works there or is the designated driver   Women who are forever alone usually try and hide that fact as best as they can since society is less favorable to forever alone women than it is to men   People feel empathy or pity for forever alone men  but that isn't the case with women   I've never really fit in either and often felt defective  but then I realized that everyone has their own defects  regardless of how perfect they may seem   I have felt angry or sad  but not really guilty or personally responsible   I just rationalize it by remembering that I didn't choose to look this way  and there is only so much I can do to attempt to look somewhat decent   So  I try and make peace with it   I don't think you sound defective  I think you unfortunately met a lot of shallow people who aren't worth your time Thanks Mold test kits are probably  not very

professional mold tester for your best options  Do your research Your future is looking bright  Way to go  I didn't lash out at all  I'm just not like that  She did try to contact me a day or 2 later  but I was still too angry to respond  so maybe it's my faultIf you snubbed her out of anger then it's your issue Don't pay   Your friend is doing one of two things  Either she does have a genuine issue in which case  as a friend tell her she needs help and you will be there for her but if she's unwilling to get help then you can't be liable for her anymore   The other option is she's crying wolf  Which as sick as it sounds  I met a few people that did just that because it gave them attention and others behaved in a way more favourable to them  It's hard to tell legit which type your friend is but regardless you need to distance a bit or you end up much worse off   I don't know enough to judge which one your friend is but the closer you get the more destructive things will get  Since you are a student I have no doubt you have enough shit to deal with   If she has a boyfriend she still has support there too  Is he aware she's like this   I am not too familiar with hospital bills in America since I'm from UK but surely since the ambulance wasn't for you then you shouldn't be liable Okay  do you prefer to only talk over Reddit or do you like other forms of communication   How could someone be repulsed at the sight of you   I get not being attracted to someone  but that is extreme   What do you look like   You don't have to answer that  if you don't want to   That's just dumb to mock someone for not having friends or a significant other  especially since a lot of people don't   I wouldn't even bother with people like that  I think that sometimes you just have to breakup with friends  If the relationship is causing you an emotional strain  and it's not something that you are willing to deal with long term  then it's ok to walk away from it  I've had to breakup with friends in the past  and while it was incredibly hard  it was worth it in the long run  I actually found that by breaking up with a friend  my own emotional maturity increased  helping me to deal with similar situations further down the road    You did the right thing  It sounds like your ex friend has some issues to work on  and it sounds like you have the maturity to do what you feel  and I agree  is the right thing to do   My thoughts and prayers will be with you today My illness hasn't been super difficult to manage for years so I have been pretty comfortable without medication  I know it's silly to think I don't need it but that was my choice  I am hopeful that my choice to see a doctor and get a referral is me hearing in the right direction for my best self  Thank you for your input but just because I chose to not medicate myself as a teenager doesn't make my choice to do so a bad one  silly and ignorant but not bad  I am hoping to find a course of treatment that is best for me  right now that includes the possibility of medication but it is ultimately up to me and my doctor  Thank you for your concern How the fuck do you even have internet access on an airplane  Answer  probably not yeah I know  but I regret that now  see post   and I am wondering if it's appropriate to add her back and apologize and stuff like thatThank you so much   I was most days in the summer  then it tapered off during the semester  I was in a weight training class this semester  I need to go work out again  but I've been picking up some night shifts so that's been putting a damper on my ability to work out because I've hardly been sleeping from the Zoloft tapering  It's just a nice little cycle that I need to try and break here soon    I only have a few more night shifts then I plan on even just hitting the treadmill in my apartment building's small gym    I promise that I'm not trying to make an excuse for everything  but I've noticed with weight training that my appetite decreases  and with running I hadn't been with it long enough to really be able to tell with working 12 hour shifts  5 days a week in the summer haha  Thank you for the encouragement and sub Reddit suggestion it's very much appreciated Thank you Quick question  How  When I get so drunk that I don't remember anything  I'm unable to properly walk  Let alone end up in a bed with someone Hi there  Firstly I want to say how sorry I am that you have a parent like this  I do too and I know exactly what you are going through    I just wanted to say "don't panic" what you were feeling is decades of anger  hurt  disappointment and everything else  It must have been so overwhelming because you have held it in for so long    As you mentioned  you can't fix her because she doesn't want to be fixed  This is her burden to bear  not yours    The only thing you can do here is save yourself first  Is there anyway that you can move out of the house and away from her  The sooner that you are away the sooner you can start to heal yourself    After you've gotten away then get yourself some counselling  I'm not going to lie and tell you that it's easy  because it isn't  However  you can start to work through this whole thing and begin to heal yourself  You can't help your Dad or your sister while you are still broken  Remove yourself from the situation as soon as you can    Your dad is an adult and is responsible for his own decisions  You are not deserting either him or your sister  In time you will be able to provide a haven for them to escape to  You may even inspire them both to make their escape as well    Please don't medicate yourself with alcohol or drugs  pharmaceutical or other  but keep yourself clean so that you can properly heal    I truly wish you the best  Stay strong my friendNevermind  It isn't bad but it isn't worth explaining  It's a UK thing I think Check out before and after photos of patients who have undergone IPL BBL Photo Skin Rejuvenation  Skintyte II Skin Tightening  and other procedures at Canyon Laser and Skin Care  https   www drvanas com laser skin care gallery Thank you congratulations on your new baby to be  I wish you all the best  a 1 year old isn't exactly a walk in the park   especially when people give you the "they are just so well behaved" out in public Does reading fiction like Asoiaf and lord of the rings count  Or has my time reading them been for naught  If so  what kind of "reality" books am i supposed to read  Ww2 stories  Smutty novels  Or just the newspaper Most airlines offer in flight wifi The next time he contacts you  send him an itemized bill for the extra services you've provided so far  Then told him those are free because you're writing them off  For the new questions he's asking you  tell him it will cost "x" for the new advice  as this will be considered something that falls under your "cost per month" policy  Add that this is not negotiable  Do NOT answer another question after that until you receive a payment from him I prefer Reddit  I am EXTREMLY ugly  spotty face with multiple scars  big nose  bogeyed eyes  deformed ears and a square head  When people do mock me I don't respond  but it still hurts Hahaha  Not sure that would fly with my grandmotherDo i have to learn all those verb  synonyms  subjective words class thingies  Is it mandatory Plrase avoid clinging to your abuser like so many adolescents and young adults do  Get away from toxic situations and remember this cycle needs to end with her    THIS IS NOT YOUR FAULT  You fucked up by not getting a receipt  You fucked up   hardcore    Move out asap and chalk it up to a lesson learned   either pay by traceable means or get a damn receipt Thank you so much  We are in the process of moving in with my parents right now which will make this much easier  but will come with its own stressors  I have hope to get through this with all the support I have and I am excited to start my new journey I used to have social issues myself due to abusive parents and bullying   Whilst it may be different for you  I want to ask what is it that makes you anxious specifically  For example it could be the feeling of being worthless  the feeling you will be mocked or even just not knowing how people will respond   Finding out why you feel this way is a massive help  at least it was for me  From there it's small steps  ultimately online things are pretty good for things like this    I mean you could put almost anything here and it's not going to affect your life outside of reddit at all  That kind of freedom means you don't have to be as worried  if someone doesn't like you then that's fine  you never speak or hear from them again   If you want someone to speak to  I'm open  also thank you for that link I will offer help there too   As for your brother  he's 14  that's pretty normal  I have two brothers both younger and often the only time I hear from them is when they are in big trouble or they want something Friendships are always great when you have a lot in common  when you're attentive to one another and when you can make each other laugh  Being attentive is the best because it makes you seem like you care for the person and they'd want to prolong your friendship  Don't be one of those people who like offending others as a joke because it can get too far and people have a right to be offended Thank you so much for the suggestion and support  r getdisciplined   r NonZeroDay   r selfhelpThank you Probably best to just let it slide   Anything now will seem ham fisted and flaky on your part   That's my opinion anyway   Also  movies in theatres are usually a bad first date setting Thank you Thank you A little tip from someone WAY on the other side of you   Don't ask girls out like it's a "thing "  If you like a girl  just say "Hey let's go grab a cup of coffee  or whatever       Then don't sit there with nothing to say or do    build up your game a bit  Do things in your life worthy of talking about        Don't push on girls  if it happens it happens  if not MOVE ON   Don't fall in love with every girl that bats her eyes at you   Don't worry about whether girls are friends or not   remember THEY are in the same play as you  they are thinking all the same things   Just try not to be a douchebag with them    Everything else will fall into place Thank you So there is no hope for people on the spectrum  I'm talking about Autism  Aspergers and sperg lords Talk to the principal  This is beyond the pale Thank you I'm excited to start a new journey Find a store that

mentioned that earlier in this thread Confidence exists  It's influence in success is just greatly overrated  and not just in relationships I had a friend tell me once that there are two places every person should visit in their lifetime  one of them is Las Vegas  the other is Venice  Don't miss Vegas  it's a riot  Go with some friends  Also  I'm a New Yorker  so yeah  don't miss New York either  It's just endless things to do and see Nobody would care Explain to him that you have gone far beyond what was agreed upon to satisfy him  reminding him that you can no longer provide ongoing service for free  If he needs ongoing service you will be glad to set him up on a monthly plan or possibly a charge for service basis  But that you can no longer provide free support  Well  it's a start  When you finally accept this  then you can pursue other hobbies  that will at least have some hope of success and fulfillment You're only 4 5 months in  chief  When she feels love for you  she'll tell you  regardless of who did what to her First time I've heard of this  does anyone have a link I am guessing you are 32  or 33 in a lucky case   You  be the initiator of an invite Why didn't you get a

tell her that you're looking forward to taking her out for lunch dinner once she's out of hospital I feel like there is a bit of a misunderstanding  I acknowledged I needed help  and I am getting help  I didn't feel I needed to call the hotline  it was more of a way to help myself stop and take a breather to think about what it is I really wanted to do as far as care  With my illness it's incredibly hard to slow down my brain and think rationally  my husband wanting me to call the hotline was his way of helping me confirm that I am making the right choice for myself    I am going to my appointment this afternoon  And after making this post yesterday I haven't felt anything but positive about my choice to get help  Thank you for your concern Thank you Even little tiny intervals can make a difference  Like try to do five  one minute intervals of elevated heart rate  stairs  jog in place  jumping jacks  etc  and you can gradually increase it    And sleep and sleep cycles as I'm sure you already know  affect mood and health so much  I bet the night shifts aren't helping anything but I know it's difficult if that's just a fact of life right now  There are various other things but they'd all be small tweaks     like try not to drink too much since it can keep your stomach full  try lower fat foods drinks since fat inhibits appetite  etc  Chewing ginger or ginger tea can help if you're actually nauseous Thank you same to you Internet hugs are just as comforting and I appreciate them all the sameThen how does false confidence exist One piece of advice I read once suggested only asking questions that you were truly interested in knowing the answer  I like that  because you're using a conversation with another person as a fact finding mission  You won't feel fake if you're in the conversation to improve your knowledge    I don't know if that'll help or hurt the asshole thing  but I think it does wonders with social anxiety and freezing up in a conversation  Thank you I'm so glad your mother got the help she needed and I hope all is well with her and your family  That's more deluded than the guys who say women only date 10 10 Chads  Of the

 Especially given her character on the showI know it's normal  I think she knows it's normal too but she's just like barely functioning this morning and shes practically ignoring me  I think she's

parents asking Once the honeymoon period is over   it won't be cute  Yep i try to keep my foods decently low fat  I only work as needed  so I don't pick up shifts too often  I picked some up during my winter break  and I only have 4 shifts left in the next two weeks  Then I will be back on my normal schedule    The intervals thing sounds good  I'll definetly try that and work in some dumbbell stuff too  Disclaimer  I'm from Portugal    North America and Europe is a bit of an apple and oranges situation  Depends on what you want  If you opt for visiting Europe  then I'd say Portugal rather London  England or Paris  France    Personally I find both London and Paris overrated  I find both Porto and Lisbon more beautiful and they're cheaper and safer  People speak much better English than in Paris  the weather is much better than in London   They agree        Portugal  T Ls 2016 Destination of the Year   http   www travelandleisure com destination of the yearThis is the best advice yet  my pal found someone who caused havok and he had to get back involved 2 years later  was 18 when he set up a bussiness and he learneed if he was not thier it did not get done   Get a agency to find

the smoke detector is malfunctioning or THE PLANE IS   I am really eager to hear from OP  This is gold right here  Let him know and he will be so happy as he may be worried about his snoring  OP congrats and wish you many years of happiness  Sometimes people take out their insecurities on others  which are amplified when you don't act the way they anticipate  even if that anticipated behavior is not something you'd ever do  So  yes  Also  sometimes in retail people come in looking for someone to yell at   had one guy come in on the same day every year  screaming about wanting a replacement for a  5 hose he bought 10 years earlier  which we no longer sold or stocked  The store had reimbursed him in cash in full the first time he came in to complain   He just wanted someone to yell at Okay  then Reddit it is   I struggled with acne and have acne scars   I'm trying a new fade cream   Scars don't necessarily make you ugly   I have some   I think my one friend is absolutely gorgeous  even with her self harm scars   I'm sorry people have been so mean to you  you didn't deserve that   You have to remember that it's not your fault   There are people who will like you for your personality and be friends with you        People who are cruel are most often suffering in ways we don't understand  They deserve our empathy as well   What OP did wasn't a cruel response though  It was an expression of their own suffering  Hopefully the mother will see the suffering in her home and take steps to minimize her part in it before she creates more pain and  likely  loss in her life

the future once his slimeball ways have been revealed  It's hard not to pull away more when you are feeling disconnected but the key thing to try to remember that is sometimes difficult to get through to yourself at least I'm having a hard time with it  is that if they didn't want you to be there they wouldn't have invited you  I know part of the distance for me was created by my own actions in pushing to hard to spend time with the 1 friend I had that actually wanted to do stuff with me and I did come across as clingy I'm pretty sure  There's another disconnect with a different person there that I still have to try to figure out what is even causing it  I tried to test the waters and see if he would want to go do something with me sometime because I'd love to learn from him but not a single time showed any interest in it at all  Which is odd to me since it is a common interest for us   Something I was always told growing up was "Actions speak louder than words " Since I know what is causing that one disconnect I'm hoping to repair things by showing her with actions with is going to take months probably  So until that is fix I'm back to being alone  which sucks but meh I've gotten got at it in my years  If I can repair it knowing what caused it in the first place I just have to be mindful of not doing the same that caused the rift to begin with    Talking about it might help  but back it up with the actions to show a positive change because words don't mean anything on their own  Depending on what caused the disconnect remember that once repaired those cracks still exist and re open easier than they were created the first time so continue working on it   Yo move out and in with a friend or just find a roommate Been caught out myself like that so nobodys immune

instead of being real with her bed I'm no fan of the way Big Pharma operates and they need some strict regulation on how their studies and operate as ethical business that should be what is a reason to treat a little differntly than a normal non essential business is although they CEO's would whine about being interfered with by bad government that should have not ability to have any authority of any for profit corporation as they will claim that making is what is the most important aspect of what they do  and I fully support them being brought to task for showing just how out of control they have become since they were to Bribe   I'm sorry I meant lobby to have all the previous restrictions that they used be under because of just important it was to fully maintain the safety of what they sell for the benefit of the people of the USA which was put in place back when the government for most part viewed their main service was to make this country work for the people and just slowly got chipped at and is now the exact opposite    I understand the danger of these powerful opiates but I would never want those that truly will need these things to basically be able any sembelance of any quality of life to lessen chronic pain that these are really only the effective drug to do this for those that are suffering this way   I don't understand why it is now being so hard to get for people that really for them and take them properly and for real pain reduction just someone else made the choice to take for the high and just lost control  Hey that sucks for the person who got addicted from getting high on these but that is not a reason the person who truly has real need for it is now basically going back to the hell they suffered before they were able to use these drugs and it is not even  a choice that they would even consider about making the choice of trying to live without these drugs and live with the deterotion of their life from the chronic pain but at least they aren't at risk of addiction or taking them and being able to do things in their lives and not wanting to kill themselves that anyone has had a major injury has to endure serious constant pain for just a month   I hurt my back and shoulder in 2014   I had kind lasped in workout for about year and when I started back I overlooked that as I'm aged I really need to be very careful about not doing too much  warming up all the things that when I was in my 20's yeah tried to do that  but if got a little careless it never really hurt me seriously other being a little more sore than would have been had gone through proper steps preworkout   So I wake one morning and I can't raise my body up to get of bed   The pain was sharp and not just when I tried to move  it was constant and I had never experienced   I had have someone come help get of bed   So I'm hurting but felt that just to take it easy and rest and in day or two this going be going away   Two weeks later I'm a total mess   I could hardly sleep  no position was able to be in for very long because how much it hurt and it never let up  A week later I seriously was considering at least more than ever thought about ever  suicide  I couldn't imagine more day   I had no health insurance so I couldn't see a Dr   And I thought wasn't going just come out this with out medical help   So I'm sitting there just staring at my shotgun for hours as I had move often just to take my mind off just sitting hurting    And I truly that if the Teeter Hangup  commercial hadn't come on when it did or I would had the TV off  I wouldn't not be alive by morning   I watched infomercial felt that was only choice that may work I had no idea if it would do anything since know exactly what I had injured    It came three days later and it took a whole to put it all together because I was so impaired   Used immediately and I couldn't believe how 1 minute on it  after got off it  I felt a reduction in the intensity of the pain that when you have been at full blast for 3 weeks a 10  reduction in pain feels like heaven even though I would hurting bad if had been feeling this new lower level without feeling the worse level before it     My point is I got lucky   Teeter fixed my problem which showed me I had slipped a disk and had a nerve bundle pinched and also had my sciatic never injured that together was hell  4 weeks later I was almost pain  That little amount time I went through with severe chronic pain  had me wanting to apologive for every chronic pain sufferer that I kind of felt they just needed to man up and toughen up and stop a pansy and need a drug to do what I used feel could be fixed just through will power   I will never want to deny these people they strongest opiates they need to live life with a little less pain  Someones addiction shouldn't keep them from relief   One has nothing to do with other I sometimes dwell on this too much  but those real close "true" friends are  as far as I've come to know  people you can trust to forgive you  if you humble yourself and ask for it  Maybe it'll take a few days or weeks but eventually whatever happened will strengthen your relationship   I can badmouth just about everyone  except for said friend's or mutual acquaintance's family  that is too far man don't do that  to them  act gay ish  talk about girls  science  things they know nothing about or don't care about  and the conversation will roll  Or I'll be asked told to switch topics if I don't realize sooner that I'm boring the person  or there'll be a bad segway into something we both like   There is mutual respect that allows for this awkwardness without any sort of consequence   Honestly I don't know why my best friends are best friends  They're the biggest idiots I've met  and we only have a few overlapping hobbies interests  Though over the years we've influenced each other so much that I've taken up bicycling and World Of Tanks  despite previously disliking both  I've shared my love of music and photography  and they've also absorbed some of it   I dunno man it's weird  Probably just wasting your time with this incoherent mess of a reply lol  But happy new year I'm going to give some brutally honest advice here I guess    She's probably feeling the same way  As someone planning a wedding  there are a lot of people that you end up feeling like you have to invite  People who may or may not come  but it is nice and respectful to send an invitation to anyway    Honestly  if you feel like you never really see her or are that close  she probably isn't really expecting you to come anyway  If she sends an invitation  it's probably out of respect or a kind gesture   Edit  So don't feel guilty  It's probably not as big of a deal as you think it is This seems a bit more aggressive than I would like but I may have to take this route   The thing I'm worried about is since the business is new  I don't want bad feedback from anyone because I've seen firsthand how it destroys businesses   He will not listen to emails from me then emails every day asking questions and changes   My business operates through PayPal and I am weary of chargebacks because I know they are really awful for allowing it I'm going to disagree with you  Your brain is  yes  shaped by experiences  and habitual behaviors are formed  But the fun part about human neural anatomy is that the brain is maleable  New connections are made every single day between your neurons  as you learn and experience new things  Old connections can also be lost or inhibited  It is not impossible to learn to "be positive" or "go out and do something" by any means  But it's hard  It takes time  it takes a lot of effort and the will to make the change and stick with it  Mental illness makes that more difficult  I know  You aren't getting the correct levels of essential neurotransmitters traveling to necessary areas required to even try to feel motivated    But the idea that this can't be done at all  that you can't "change" the way you think is quite wrong  There would be a lot of people in the psychotherapy  neuroscience and pharmaceutical fields that would be out of jobs if you couldnt  Myself included  It takes perseverance  the right help  and patience  And that is the part that makes it all feel impossible  it isn't instantaneous and requires a lot of mental effort  Damn  I'm the exact same  This was how my mom was as well  right down to the attitude  denial  and characteristics you describe your mom as having  I'm going to give it to you straight  Your mom is not going to change  Yelling  pleading  bargaining  bribing will not change her  I've been there  I've tried  She needs to have the desire to change and from what you describe that isn't going to happen anytime soon  So you need to figure out a way to get out and save your own sanity   Alcoholism permanently messes the brain up  There are the temporary effects we all know of when a person drinks  but extended use leads to both temporary  ex  hepatic encephalopathy when the liver is unable to filter all the toxins properly and the brain is poisened  and permanent  ex  Weirnicke's encephalopathy is a permanent dementia from the brain being starved of nutrients after extended alcohol abuse  damage   The frontal lobe  cortex  and white matter of the brain become damaged and all of those characteristics we associate with people being drunk  decreased inhibitions  impulsivity  denial of problems deficits  short term memory and attention deficits  decreased safety  decreased social skills  and overall just a decreased ability in executive function and complex thinking  actually become permanent  even if the person has stopped drinking   I've seen it first hand in my patients  I'm a cognitive therapist  and looking back on it I realized my mom was the same  I wish I knew then what I do now   It's a near impossible task of trying to get a person to stop something they are physically and mentally addicted to and are in denial that it's a problem  Not only that  but even in the miraculous situation that they decide to stop  it's not likely they're going to sober up to a fully functioning person   I went low contact with my mom  only saw her a couple times a year when forced  It sucked and I caught a lot of shit for it  but I still don't regret doing it given the other options  The alcoholism killed her  and I'm glad I didn't force myself to watch the self induced train wreck that I couldn't save   Sorry for the long wall of text  In short  save yourself  Be "selfish" and get out of there  She already chose her fate  you deserve the ability to choose yours people who use jargon like socialized dont know dick about shit in this world  the prior one  or any of the ones that may come after thisSo tons of people on here are suggesting meetup  And for good reason  it works    Taking a casual acquaintance to a friendship takes time  And when you don't have an activity to fill that time  it's exceptionally difficult  Having an activity takes the edge off    I really recommend Toastmasters  a meetup  a board game guild  Something where you're doing things with a group of people  It's good practice for socializing and will take the edge off   gotcha  ok so my advice might not be that relevant haha  good luck with whatever you decide What do you mean  This is a subject that has intrigued me for a long time  so I'll offer my thoughts   First of all not only have you offered no compelling argument against the existence of confidence  but you have also  perhaps unwittingly  provided a hypothesis for how confidence is formed  First by admitting confidence comes from successful  Ergo positive  experiences  the obvious admission here is if one can affect the outcome of their experience by "Acting" confident to generate a successful experience  then he can grow in confidence over time   Aka  fake it till you make it    On a practical level  your counter argument would naturally be "I do fake confidence  and still suffer rejections"  But this is not a counter argument to forming confidence  The fact faking confidence does not guarantee success is not indicative that faking confidence can not lead to "true" confidence IF you are successful    However self confidence comes in many forms  and crosses over with such concepts as Self Efficacy and Self Esteem  For example you can be extremely confident in your programming abilities  this is more Self Efficacy   but have a very low opinion of yourself as a person  Self esteem   Naturally  you are referring to a very specific type of self confidence and conflating it with how it can influence your success with women  This isn't an argument against the existence of self confidence  it's an argument against the level of attraction self confidence arouses in a woman in spite of  or combined with additional social factors  such as looks  wealth  status  personality    Anyways  I don't want to waffle on  but I do believe that confidence is something that can grow over time  From a practical experience  I grew in confidence immensely from the age of 18 to 30  and now can safely say I am truly confident in myself  There was a lot of factors which contributed to this  but unless anyone is interested I won't bother going into depth That's pretty much a spot on description of me  Yeah the problem lies in you  But you are not the asshole  you just don't have social intelligence  I surround myself only with cool people that i care about and they care about me I totally agree  dude  It's like  I wrote this Yes or they put it all over social media accounts  I just don't believe in sharing every detail of my life to the world I started facing this problem around age 34 35 as well and greatly improved my friend situation this year  These are some strategies that worked for me   I read Daring Greatly by Brene Brown  It is not a book about socialization  but it gave me the courage to be myself and be OK with that   Instead of focusing on the making friends I changed my focus to being a friend that I would want to have  I thought about the qualities I wanted in my friends and started treating people that way  I wanted my friends to be important to me  so I started trying to be important to them  I took an interest in them  asking them questions about their favorite music  books  movies  etc  I started inviting people to do things and I tried to never let it bother me if it didn't happen right away   Never do something for someone because you think it will make you a friend  Set internal boundaries  Do only things that you are comfortable with  For example  this year I acknowledged birthdays with small gifts  I did this because I wanted to and it made me feel good doing it  It also helped to show those people that I pay attention to their lives and care  I did not do this to get birthday gifts on my birthday  If giving birthday gifts wasn't something I wanted to do  then I might feel taken advantage of when I didn't get something in return or even a thank you  This will not be fixed overnight  it can take awhile to build a foundation with people  Keep working at it and know that other people have experienced the same things and we know how you feel  Just don't give up  It'll keep your mind proactive helping keep your mind busy and positive until you've set yourself up  idk  i feel like you know where you want to live  you don't need me to answer this question  seems to me like home feels best to you because of the people and the comfort  and that's not a bad thing  also  you aren't interested in what you study at the moment   my advice  find something that you actually DO want to study  and then your schoolwork won't be such a chore  and it might actually become a part of life that you enjoy  It will get better  It might take forever  but give yourself the patience and time  Cry when you need to   break stuff if you need to  Let yourself go through the motions  And when people need you  be there for them  Maybe cry together    It will never be okay  but you will learn to cope  If you need to talk  pm me  I've had a pretty similar experience so I understand  the best advice to medical issues is to see a doctor  or in your cats case a vet   as the diagnosis can change on a case by case basis   I'm scared of letting people truly get to know me  in case they find out how much of a flawed person I really am    See  the thing is  pretty much everyone else is the same way    at best they just don't show it  Everyone is flawed  sometimes very deeply  Even people you'd never expect to be  Going out of my way to talk to people and try to get to know them better taught me that   Presenting an authentic version of yourself lets you select for the people who are flawed in the same way as you are   Note that it might take a considerable amount of time to find someone like that  people are varied  so this is just a matter of statistics  Not an indicator of how irredeemably broken you are or something  Happy birthday  hitmaker   Tell him about your feelings  if you feel like it  It's hard  but it will be hopefully worth it  I'm keeping my fingers crossed for you  r evenwithcontwxtMe neither  I'm old enough that my lack of life experience with relationships would be really unpleasant instead of even a little endearing  depends on what you want to do  did you go to college  lots of small towns have trade schools you can go to  are you looking for a career or just another job  Attractive facial features   Good genes    People like to say this like it's proven science or something  It's not  There is very little reason to believe it might be true  Facial attractiveness is just "averageness" of features and it does not correlate to "good genes"  If you really are ugly  please don't let that make you think you are any less of a person or that you are inferior in any way  It's a shitty hand to be dealt but you can still "attract" people and even the opposite sex if you can develop a fun loving and kind personality  Since you're both girls  you should be fine    However I feel it's noteworthy to mention if  you  were a  n ugly  guy doing this same thing  you'd be both "creepy" and a pervert Contact the manufacturer Needs more jpg  I understand that  I've had a friend whom I would do anything for without question  I have deep feelings for her and I keep dropping my words  Even if what time we spent together ment the world to me  the words "I love you " Can't seem to roll off my toung  When I can talk to her about my feelings toward her she chuckles at me like I'm joking around and I'm not  It tears me in two   But  the words "I love you " Never seem to escape my mind  It feels too difficult to tell her    I was never meant to be in a relationship  that life was made for someone else  someone normal   FYI  this is also the "just world" fallacy  just applied in reverse   The truth is  you just don't know  You might fail  you might not   That  is what you need to accept   Also  it's okay to feel worn out after lots of rejections  that's how it works  But eventually you get over it  and can decide to try again  if you want  It's best to go at it with no expectations one way or another  with the curiosity of a young child  Do things  and see what happens  If some actions lead to a better outcome some of the time  do more of that  Rinse and repeat As shitty as it is  it might take some kind of consequences to get her to stop and get help  You must be very careful not to enter into a codependent relationship with her or a relationship where you are the parent in the situation  Also remember that her choices are hers and you aren't responsible for actions   Keep your chin up and finish strong at Uni Update us please You asked her out via text and she didn't respond at all Nerves  if I had to guess  You care too much what others think of you  and that makes you anxious  Anxiety clouds the mind    Go at your own pace and say things as you intend for them to be said  If you think too much about others  you'll get distracted and lose your train of thought The Internet  TV  and other media let you have social connection without vulnerability  It can be a great  starting place  for talking about stuff that's too tough to talk about otherwise   stuff that chokes you up and makes your head spin   But vulnerability is crucial to feeling fulfilled in real life   Brene Brown has a great TED talk on the subject  https   www ted com talks brene brown on vulnerability t 167947    Maybe the reason you don't care is because you're not having vulnerable conversation  You know  the sort of conversation where people would say you're 'keeping it real'  You're not having conversations which question or put your emotions  beliefs  expectations  and preferences on the line   Knowing how to do pleasantries is super important   your first question to someone new shouldn't be like 'Has anyone close to you died recently' or 'Do you have a purpose in your life '   but learn to navigate conversation and steer conversation in it a more vulnerable direction   If you need inspiration on how to do that  find a podcasts that does good interviews  My recommendations are ' On Being  http   www onbeing org  ' or ' Death  Sex    Money  http   www wnyc org shows deathsexmoney '   That's how you have conversations that 'matter' Well just a week late may not necessarily mean she's pregnant I've had many instances where my gf and I didn't use any protection and she would be two weeks late  stressing me the hell out in the process  but every time she was just late  Vitamin C is known to induce a period if it's late so you could have your gf just go to the nearest pharmacy and buy over the counter vitamin c and take that as directed  That method has also worked for my gf and I  Who cares if he ignores it  Don't work with him anymore If it was to the point of being pathological  probably gymnophobia That might be a good idea  I know she's looking forward to being mobile again   I like the idea of bringing her cookies  I'll make something for her and bring them in    thanksThis is tricky  It's pretty normal for a parent to want to shield her child from this sort of stuff  And ordinarily I would say that you should leave that stuff to the parents  However  in your case you are already aware of the information  so you are worried and have concerns  and also may not have all the information  You are also old enough to understand what is going on   Given that  and assuming you have a decent relationship with your mother  which it sounds like you do  I think it would be fine for you to reach out to her    Be prepared for her to potentially be embarrassed or defensive  or even deny it  As a parent  it's very traumatic to feel like you are letting your children down  Stay calm  let her know that you love her  and that you want to help   Good luck man If tenant laws in the UK are anything like in the US  she can't just kick him out  She has to give him notice as if he were a regular tenant  Tell him to go back home and tell his mother he will be out in a month  That will give him time to set himself up 5 Fears for Women about Aging  http   healthdoctrin com 5 fears women aging I'm starting to accept that I'll probably never have a boyfriend  But the word "probably" signals slight hope so I guess I haven't written it off 100  yet Me myself  Have noticed over the years on the odd occasion a girl might have wanted to spent some time with me alone  She was torn between spending time with me or not as im not normal in fact deformed   Not enough to be classed by some as repulsive but enough to stop anyone from being seen to befriend me    In fact thinking about it  I don't think I have ever been in the company of a female alone for more than a few minuites in my life bar family of course     Take him back to the doctor  He's probably in terrible pain I'm like your boyfriend  My wife is like you in that she's a very emotional type person  So I understand both sides to some degree  It's hard for me to express my feelings at times to my wife  I like to show my love in a different way like acting as her voice of reason in tough situations or when disagreements happen at work  I make sure to provide for her and our child the best I can as way to show she's important to me   To make sure our relationship is on the right track we regularly talk about a sort of grade for each of the 3 main aspects of the relationships  passion  friendship  and trust  I think   It's our opportunity to bring to light things we aren't getting enough of  such as words of affirmation  "you look pretty"    Of course this kinda depends on if your bf wants to improve in the relationship  If not  there may not be much you can do to at that point   Hope that helpsI faked it until I made it  so I can't agree with this post in all honesty "I'll be thinking of you  and sending positive vibes "It's hard op  Been dealing with a friend of mine whom is going through the same issues with her husband whom works with me  I get to see him on weekdays and he seems fine  The dark reality of it is he is a savere diabetic and I lost another friend of mine of the same issues years ago  So I'm dealing with going through the same dark hell two times over  I lost a set of friends whom adopted me into their family and now I'm back at it again watching it fall apart in front of my face  I'm still shaken up by it so I know your worry  If I was the kid of my friends I would have sent them to be helped even if it was against their will  It's not something that if I was busy as you I would play with or worry about  It isent fun or fair that you get to deal with this and attend uni trying to improve your life  So my advice is simply send her for help and walk away  It's extremely difficult to do  Sometimes it's just the best option  Come back to her or it whenever you can and don't let it cloud your personal success  I believe that you can do what you set your mind to do  I wish you the best of luck OP  I hope things improve from here  Well as I suffer from that condition tok the best thing is to show him support and listening to him  Dont tell him "it will be better" or "there is nothing to be sad about"  Because often depressive phases have no real reason and it makes us feel like our feelings arent important   It can be that someone with depression can be quite clingy and you should tell him if it gets too much   But by just supporting him Maybe asking him to hang out or go somewhere is nice to distract him is the best thing you can do  Tell him its never bad to seek  professional  help since you  like you said  cant relate  I wish someone told me this earlier I'm wishing you a happy New year and hope  that it will take a turn to the better for you   You mentioned  that he knows about his issues  Not everyone can easily express himself  but it sounds you're trying to push him in the right direction  You sound like a fantastic girlfriend   Maybe see a counselor  It may sound like a stupid idea ala "that's for old people"  but it may be worth a shot   Bad feedback on a business early on can be massively damaging  I've seen this first hand   As well as that I take payments through PayPal and I know they will probably refund him for no real reason if he tried  I'm also pretty sure that's why he's claiming desktop site doesn't work   That being said  you are probably right  Wasting time on a lost cause isn't going to help anything  Right now i'm not even interested in having a relationship but want actual friends that are real and honest  I just think that itself is impossible as people are far too judgmental and ignorant Nothing  Not even after I ran into her later that nightI am so sorry  I lost my Dad at a young age too  It's been over 20 years  Look for signs from him  You'll know them when you see them  It's very comforting  I still get signs  The main one is hawks  When one is around  he's there  Every time I go to his grave  a hawk screeches  You'll know the signs but you have to watch and listen for them  If something seems weird or different  think if it's something he would do or if that would remind you of him or something you did together  Time will make things easier  You need to find a new normal  This will take time  He is still with you but in a different manner  I have the same problem  On top of my SSRIs and others  I take Adderall XR which eliminates any appetite I might have had  It's rough because you're hungry and your body  already under the dead weight of depression  is tired from not getting food  But yesterday I almost threw up after 2 bites of a club sandwich    My only advice is to eat anything you can and not be hard on yourself about whether or not it's healthy  Calories are what is important for me  not necessarily nutrition at this point  I can empathize with your problem of having ideas but unable to fluidly transfer them  Inside my mind  everything is laid out but they would come out as broken pieces instead of a whole  It also doesn't help that my social anxieties also causes me to stutter  r meirlProbably wasn't a tenant  How often for you pay rent living at your mom's place Sit down with her and talk  Have a deep conversation and see what's going on  Also motivate her to work again and help  you need the help too  it's only fair  something i'm going to try to do this year is not talk badly about any of my friends to anyone else  sometimes i would vent about one friend to another friend  not in a catty way  just in a venting way   but I'm going to try to stop doing that  If I have a problem with a friend  I'm going to either confront them or let it go  not spread my feeling to other people  I'm on a prescription for depression  it doesn't make me into a zombie or anything like that  Keep your head up  things will always get better You'll never find out from them unfortunately  Online dating doesn't work for people like us  And whatever you do  don't pay for it Date  s    Beat it  normie  thanksYou need to go to a trusted adult  preferably 35  simply for life experience and wisdom  and discuss this with them  This is well beyond the scope of Internet strangers   Good job OP just stay the course They know that you're in the room right      right It's 2017  Airplane WiFi is a thing dongleberry if you're only looking for jobs online  try just walking into local stores and asking for jobs  If your small town has a craigslist  check on there for job offerings  Mine is full of jobs that have no previous skills required  I'm sure at least one company in your town needs unskilled labor   if you haven't already  try going to the trade school and telling them of your situation  Look for a scholarship  grant  etc  It looked like you were heading in the right direction until the last paragraph GRATS   I forgot to mention it's his family home  His elder brother and sister both live there as well  He had a dispute argument with his mum and whilst he was away for New Years she packed his stuff in bags and left them out the house   He attempted to come back in using his keys on New Year's Day but they were double locked from the inside and couldn't get in From what I understand he wasn't paying any rent to his mumHow is opt out equal to 'mandatory'  When I went in June 2016 we didn't have it  Was with Brussels Airlines  I'm from Belgium  Ouch  I'd just accept defeat and move on  Someone just has to live somewhere to be considered a tenant  at least in the US  Tell him to check his tenant laws  It is likely very illegal for them to kick him out like that  I know that you think face to face is the right way to do this but me being a female  I know there are many different ways to express yourself   Sometimes when we get so wrapped up on the words we want to say  they come out wrong   Write the words down   Make sure it says what you want it to say  Write the letter in your own handwriting and send it to her through snail mail   She will be able to keep that letter for the rest of her life so make it good   Being in your own handwriting makes it personal   If she accepts you then you can go and be honest with her without being afraid   I would treasure a letter handwritten by my love so that I can read it over and over again   Good luck I was right where you are for a good chunk of my life   Your family probably is uncomfortable with the topic and would rather keep it at arms length than address it with you   Try not to build resentment towards them for not understanding   I have bipolar 2 and for a good chunk of my early life my parents were the same way towards me   After my diagnosis and it was easier to manage and talk to them about my condition then it became easier to interact with them    I also dropped out of college because I don't need  a lot of money   I'm a home owner but I make enough off my "normal" job to pay the bills  I couldn't see myself spending all that time in school then working a job I wasn't happy with just to make money   I just couldn't see it happening  But unfortunately if you live in the USA  in Michigan  then you are conditioned to believe you need to go to college to succeed but that is absolutely not true    As far as finding a girl it'll happen   I had shitty relationship after shitty relationship  Stop pursuing party chicks and girls around your age   Find a chick a few years older than you that has her shit together and can accept your mental condition   Society looks down on mental illness because they don't accept it and won't realize it's a legitimate condition  But not everyone is like that   And if you believe that everyone is then you are just doing yourself a disservice    I got fired from a job after working there 5 years and telling HR about I'm bipolar  They fired me on the spot because the didn't realize mental illness is the same as physical illness   It also helps I was able to sue them and get a lot of money but still      Firing me for my mental illness is just like them firing me for being a minority  Illegal  I guess the point of the post is your better than anyone else that judges you for your mental illness and eff anyone that says otherwise   At the end of the day you will still be you regardless of what anyone else had to say or do   Keep your head up and try not to let others get to you   I completely understand it's easier said than done but after you condition yourself to know you're better than people misunderstanding you then life will get a lot easier   Reply or message if you need it  And believe me I'm just as depressed as you are  Mainly due to the toupee wearing carrot that is our president     Just trying to lighten the moodYou're seeing one of the worst parts of depression  the apathy and general lack of caring that comes with it  I've been the same way to my wife  though I'm not nearly as depressive as how your husband sounds   It tears me up knowing after that I acted that way to my wife and I think your husband will too once he's out of the depressive state   Your husband is incredibly lucky to have found you and I think he would do the same for you if it were not the crippling depression   Happy birthday and know others here are thinking of youNope  don't pay it  And ditch the friend because she's obviously a histrionic personality   If she doesn't get help  someday we'll see her kid at r raisedbynarcissists I'm with you  Procur will do wonders  I will no longer have to participate in a competition that I have no hope of success in  The truth is  you just don't know  You might fail  you might not   That  is what you need to accept   At some point I would say around 25   one should  know    It is only through accepting that it will never happen that a male can start to enjoy life      I've been drinking since I was 16  legal drinking age  and drank 20  liqueur which is what they served at parties  legal age for that 18   Got drunk very often  haven't had problems from it so far You should call it "my favorite cafe"  so that everyone who mentions it sounds like they love it I wonder why drugs work for some people in social situations  Drugs practically never made me feel okay in offline group social situations  Yes  I mean I didn't even feel okay  like it felt all wrong  limited  tense and overthinking  I could count the exceptions on fingers of one hand   They did make me feel okay online and in some 1 on 1 offline situations  but I don't really need drugs for that I assume you're religious  right  If you want to  visit your church an talk to your local priest about this  he'll understand  Many people go through this phase  were they aren't happy with their lives so they resort to drugs as an "antidepressant"  if you will       If you aren't religious or don't want to visit a church you can always do something to distract your mind from drugs  Do something fun  something that you personally enjoy  Whether it be sports  gaming or hanging out with otherpeople friends I recommend that you develop some sort of hobby  or at least do something that would help you to relax  e g  spend time with your family  listen to music  watch a movie etc  I think you should speak to her but be prepared for backlash  Parents get insecure when it comes to money really easily   My approach would be to talk to her  if she lashes out of gets angry  back away  Let her make up her own mind of how she wants to approach the situation   Even if she does get mad there's a strong chance that if you back away she will come to you later  As long as she's aware you know and your open then you have done all you can  If not  you know you can't help because she doesn't want it and that's all you can possibly do  Opt In is acceptable  If I have to go out of my way to Opt Out then you are basically saying I am a meat bag that can be used by the government for any purpose it sees fit  I tried to go to school  it didn't work  Uneven abilities is a tricky thing  The work is easy to understand  but I can't keep up with pace of life in General and complete the minimums for financial aid  and last I checked  you don't get food stamps as a student   Right now  I can manage 2 3 active  shopping  seeing a doctor  other outside activities days a week  and 1 2 household maintenance days a week  If I add more  I start failing to eat or sleep or clean the house and start overloading at inappropriate times    Within 2 weeks of minimum to get financial aid  I was so overloaded I couldn't make it to any of the meals or classes  I was doing all the work jus fine  but I couldn't go turn it in or handle dealing with the other students even to get it printed out or get food  ice  or water  Ended up trading everything I had to get a ride to a friend's    The effort just to eat enough and keep a place clean enough to be habitable and manage my most basic hygiene is a struggle requiring nearly all my effort  I've considered trying some moocs  so that eventually I could test into most of a degree over time and maybe eventually find a way finish it off  but right now it'd push my stress level to high You have to push through the apathy that comes from your depression  Will yourself to get up and do what you have been fighting for all this time  Don't want to get up  That's the depression and not you that is talking  Go out there and make the difference youve wanted to make by being an EMTMy Personal Background  I am in my 30's and was verbally and emotionally abused by my stepfather from the age of 5 until my early 20's  I suffered from chronic depression from at least age 11 until well into my mid late 20's and was in a psychiatric ward once as a suicide risk  My current relationship with my stepfather  and mother  is long distance to non existent   Knowing that about me  my opinion is this    This is 100  wrong  Your mother's words and behavior are a form of verbal and emotional abuse  The reason cause for it is unknown to me  though    You are a wonderful kid to put so much effort into maintaining a relationship and trying to remain respectful  From my personal experience  your words actions behaviors has absolutely no correlation with the way your mother is speaking to you and treating you  Meaning  you can try as much as you can to talk about it reasonably  to change your behaviors  to change your routines and personality  to adhere to everything your mother wants you to do and be  but it will never  ever make the abuse stop or even lessen  Because you are not the problem  You are not what's broken and needs to be fixed  Nothing about you is a causation for this   Very often  individuals with mental social emotional disorders and those with past experiences of being abused that are were either unable to get help or didn't realize they could be helped  will exhibit abusive behaviors  Substance abuse and addictions also tend to go hand in hand  It's a pretty terrible cycle  Reading about this may be helpful for you to not only maybe connect some dots and help you better understand your mother as just another human being  but to be aware of issues which may be arising within you and what you are at risk of   Please do some online research regarding forms of abuse to learn about what you're going through  understand how it affects you  and how you can help protect yourself  Seek counseling at school too  as you may potentially start exhibiting or already are exhibiting symptoms of depression that you aren't yet aware of for any number of reasons  chemical imbalances  strained relationship with your mother  social difficulties  past  experiences at home or at school  etc    Edit  Just noticed the very last words in your post about already experiencing depression   Always talk to someone  anyone  everyone  even your mother  about your feelings and emotions  The worst thing you can do to yourself right now is shut down emotionally  You need to find good avenues of expressing and venting your anger and frustration  rather than suppressing them  Use a blog  find supportive web forums  tweet facebook it  keep a journal  sing about it  draw  sculpt  paint  dance  play a sport  learn a martial art  go on nature hikes  take pictures  tell stories  etc   I have four kids   They all at some time or another said mean things to about me   Tell your wife to use it as a lesson that little ones pick up on our moods and whether correct or not  will internalize it and believe it is his fault   At 3 years old  there are many more years of this to come   So  suck it up  buttercup  you're just getting started That's not very nice of her Your country is beautiful   Brussels is fun   Your beer is top notch  Westvleteren XII doubly so    It seems however your airlines could step up their game   PS ship me some beer    I didn't know Finding Dory was on netflix Did you just assume OP  and  their SO genders    s Please provide some context and transparency   Who are you   What will this survey be used for  a "study" is not good enough    Etc     Glancing over your survey it seems highly unprofessional   You really need to provide more info about yourself and what this is   If you're a psych student or something akin to that and this is for a class you might mention that because that would help clear up the lack of professionalism   I've been married 37 years  It's not cute   If you sleep with someone who snores  you wake up an average of 23 times per night according to an NPR article I heard  I believe it The airport  Zaventem  is huge and has stores everywhere  I guess the planes are lacking a bit It depends so much on who it is  A girl that would constantly bug me to be more outgoing or one that would have no empathy or understanding for me  No thank you  I would probably feel worse and make a complete idiot out of nyself in front of her  Sadly this is probably true for like 80 90  of the women    But one that I can feel comfortable around and that I know has my back  Yes please My friend tried to do this  He had a degree in mechanical engineering and several years of teaching English in Japan    He either needed a sponsor to give him a job in advance or marry the girl he was moving there for  meet in Japan on the same programme   Not wanting to force the relationship  I assume  he never said  and not being able to get a sponsor over there they've moved to south Korea    You don't need a degree but without one your chances are slim  You'll need specific skills and experience to get someone to hire you instead of someone from the US or with a degree Thank you If you mean you can't memorize the menu for when you're serving I've used this trick for years  if a customer asks a question about an item  play dumb  Say "I'm sorry I'm new here and am still learning myself  Let's find out together"  Look at the item in the menu and if the answer isn't there tell them you'll go ask the manager so that you're sure you're giving them the right answer  People will always be more patient with you if they think you're new  Plus tips will be better     Like I said I use this often and I've been at the same place for 5 years  "I know 1001 ways to kill you and get away with it "Thank you I know  right I mean ps2 games on hdtv are blurred especially the text in the games  So thats why im asking do need to be near in hdtv when playing ps2 games Of course  hey its a new year  Time for some real change    Thanks for sharing your experience  I'll be asking her out the next time I see her  after break on a Tuesday Same here  I think I do give people reasons to wanna be with me  But I'm not controversial  funny or stupid enough to make a lasting impression Suffering does not cause cruelty  Suffering is an excuse for cruelty Funnily enough he studied law at university  I've just told him to look it up now  Thanks for the advice Not everyone is the same and the same goes with girls    Try to open your mind and give them all a chance  Youll find it really hard to trust someone if you think theyll just end up hurting you just because people in the past have done so  Youll find the right one eventually but youll just make it a lot harder on yourself if you keep thinking that everyone behaves the same     hope everything works out for you It seems you have had poor mental health care oversight  Finding the most therapeutic meds is not an easy process and the aftercare  medication oversight  with labs  seem to be missing  Do you live near a university treatment hospital   These seem to offer a more comprehensive treatment modality   I would recommend you see if there is some facility program such as this which can offer a more comprehensive treatment   Unfortunately  your experience with fragmented care treatment is the norm leading to ongoing torment of those with mental health disorders  Without proper medication  aftercare  and cognitive behavior therapy you can not get better  It may be time to consider hospitalization if there is a university supported facility     I hope that you seek and find care  There is hope and you are worth care for the sake of your children  Okay cool  It's not very legal here in the USA though Not any purpose  They can only do what the law states  You'd be used to save people's lives after yours has ended  My friend received a life saving lung transplant after years on the waiting list and pretty much accepting she'd be dead by 30  Amazing stuff  When you can come up with a better system you're more than welcome to propose it but as it stands you don't need your internal organs to look good at your funeral so if the unrelated and untimely death of one person can prolong the life of another  why shouldn't we Thanks a lot I really appreciate the adviceAll you can do is control what you do  It's unfortunate that she seems to be taking something out on you  I always think the same thing while sleeping  just sleeping  with a friend of mine who doesn't know I'm in love with him Alright I am a Canadian  legal drinking age is 19  and I am 16  Yes  I do drink  but the thing about drinking is you shouldnt force yourself into it  a lot of people I know dislike it but still drink  If you dont  enjoy it  dont do it  Drinking is not bad if you learn how to control how much you drink  and you also have to drink lots of water First of all coming from experience  Drew is likely pursuing someone else  From what you put its probably his ex  Why would he ask her out if he was interested in you   This may seem harsh how I put this but if you pursue this further you will end up being a fuck buddy at best   Craig however is attracted to you but you aren't to him  You need to stop leading him on plain and simple if you know there's nothing there   On top of that  I have to say people do not change in the space of two months  since you put November   Saying you are not like that anymore is a downright lie  Ultimately I have no doubt if you were asked by another guy who you were somewhat attracted to you would go ahead   This is not me saying I know you personally  I do however know many people and this is a common theme among them all   If you want to keep a guy interested then stop giving them the goods right away  It lowers your own image and lowers their interest and or loyalty in the long term   As a guy I can safely say me and a few friends had this conversation before  It boiled down to this  'if your willing to send out nudes and give yourself away that easily then who says you won't do just that if it ever went anywhere with someone else '  Again I apologise if some of this seems harsh but it needed to be said   If you want to remain friends with them both then make sure they know it's just that  You need to make sure nothing happens even when drunk  If you don't care then move on and start fresh  Good on you  Just be sure to stick by your decision to kick her out I've tried to do that before but I still end up not saying anything I want to say  I just sit there and wait for them to ask me questions  rarely do I actively bring anything serious up  I might try it again though   thank you  Cats are good tooGross  Typical SJW   Don't discuss  just label  censor and continue playing in your echo chamber   Have fun I have   So many timesIs the alarm triggering on the side of the house that the sun hits first   Are the windows metal  vinyl  or wood   If you have a loose fitting window  the sun could be warming the house and causing a window to shift enough to set the alarm off  Try to move past your previous issues  leave them in the past  Sounds like you have valuable skills  and you're working out  that's awesome  Build from where you are at  Don't let others to pressure you into getting drunk  unless you want to  and don't ruin your life by driving drunk again    I would guess your next step is to build a social circle  It doesn't have to be a social circle of popular people  seek out people who share your interests  You're still very young  you don't have crippling alimony  you're in good shape  don't doubt your self   You mentioned you have no interests  but you are interested at your work  There might be meetings for people in same career  you can try going there  You expressed interest in MMA  that's probably popular  I don't know much about it  you can maybe explore clubs catering to watching MMA  You have experience in being poor  I don't know if you're extraverted enough to maybe assist classes for people looking for jobs  We have such classes in library Talk to a psychiatrist maybe  They might have some insight on what to do Im talking about cultural marxism  its blatantly obvious  somehow its everywhere on this subreddit  I shouldn't have mentioned communism i was moreso just trying to drive the point home   Yes im sure you have a couple qualified members who also agree with your ideology but for each you must have a half dozen more "self identified" members attempting to give life experience advice based on some pseudo progressive oppression stack   Its not about hurt feelings  its about leading people who need legitamite help astray into an ideology that has nothing to do with it but always finds a way to creep into every nook and cranny of society today  Thats why i called it cancer   Yeah I know  its pretty pathetic  thanks for being the only semi rational person here after 11 years  i still love the adoring snoring of my partner  and it still helps me falling asleep much easier  Someone hands you the conch Yeah I'm somewhat introverted  and when I drink I become less shy and I have a lot more fun A cursory search says dogs may get diarrhea from it if eaten in appreciable quantities   Maybe talk to your bf on the ride home about it   And definitely make him clean it up if the dog shits in the car  Maybe I'll try chemical castration  Just masturbate 4 plus times a day  It's funner  Only take them out during the day  because they're "the best dates under the sun"    Hur hur   Crawls under a rock Talk to your mom  it sounds childish but mothers can help a lot  if you can't then find someone like 30  who you trust  I just got to find the right moment  and work up the courage    Cheers Already noted all my responsibilities during my job interview  I'm basically a jac of all trades    The person that leaves will introduce me into the job aswell    Thanks   Thanks That saying is not true  The world is full of assholes      EDIT    Okay  be good  Honest  Helpful  Want others to succeed and be happy  Have other's best interests in heart       but don't take BS from people  Sometimes you have to be an a hole to combat a world of a holes Well the genre is hardstyle  but I don't recognize the song itself  Why do you drink so much  Consider that when you go out  you don't have to get drunk  Try not drinking so much  If you cannot moderate your drinking  if you feel you  must  get drunk or you can't stop yourself from getting drunk  then you have a problem and need to get that sorted out     It is only through accepting that it will never happen that a male can start to enjoy life   Unless you're clairvoyant  you don't know that it  will  never happen  But even accepting that it very well  might  not happen is no easy feat    By the way  from 18 28  I was certain I would  never  ever manage to get a single date  I hardly ever tried seriously  so no wonder  Been dating relatively painlessly after that  once I started taking a more honest look at reality  Don't get me wrong  I've still had some horrendous failures  but there were some small successes as well  It's definitely better than "nothing at all for the rest of eternity"  I believe you have used the word 'mandatory' when you meant to say 'default'  BA is getting bought by that German company so maybe it'll change  A short piece of unusual advice  binge watch all Seinfeld episodes all the way through  Watch the way the friends engage each other and pick up their mannerisms and try them on potential friends    Become a jokester about everything  You don't have to find it interesting  Just say the goofy response and your friends will find it amicable and love you for it  I wan't a date  but not this type of date I definitely wouldn't recommend letting him know what you found before you contact someone else  Let your parents know if you have to  They can act as a support system  Sweetheart  I am so sorry for what you're going through right now  Remember none of this is your fault  Yea he can't help what he's attracted to but child porn is never ok  it perpetuates a cycle of abuse and honestly puts the victims in more harm because of the demand  I wish I was more useful  but I don't have any adviceWhy would that sever the relationship  OP states he isn't afraid that the girlfriend wouldn't like his kink  This is actually pretty common for couples to try  pretending to be strangers at a bar  not necessarily describing the sex in a cuckholding manner    It would all be monogamous  It's perfectly healthy for couples to explore links together if they're comfortable with it  So again  how are you so sure would this sever the relationship Even if I did go out with Chad levels of confidence I am still a repulsive creature who no one would willingly approach I hope you are just kidding about "chemical castration"   It  Depo Provera  can have devastating effects on your health   Your testicles will shrink   You will grow breasts   You may develop mental confusion   Try fleshlight instead If he's collecting images of underage children teens naked  then it's already crossed the line into seriously illegal territory  I think you need to talk to someone you trust  and then consider talking to an authority figure if you believe that appropriate  because at this point it becomes a concern whether or not he will act on it  But really  you can't deal with this alone  Definitely get outside perspective  I got a 23  Good for you op  Have fun in collegeThank you for your reply  it really means a lot to me  Absolutely The times I've occasionally done penetration it was referred to as a strap on  I mainly give oral and grind genitals together  Because of HRT stimulation of other parts of my body like my breasts can get me off Honestly  I would   1  Consult r legaladvice to figure out the best course of action going forward that protects you  2   Delete this post  Child pornography is serious  Being in possession of child pornography is a really big deal   I'm not trying to judge you or your life   Truly   I didn't see those photos and I don't know exactly what they hold   But upon seeing them  you are describing them as child porn  so I'm taking you at your word   Stay on the medication  It can take a few months for your moods to even out and get over side effects  If things are the same or getting worse  don't be afraid to say so to your boyfriend mother physician  It could mean a lot of tweaking of dosage and medication to find what works for you   I believe there is a strong connection between you living paycheck to paycheck  not being able to contribute equally  and feeling financially trapped and the stress of all those that may be triggering your preexisting mental health issues    If your issues are tied to anxiety and places that require a lot of social interaction with strangers  I would suggest you apply for a job in logistics warehousing where you may potentially feel more comfortable not having to deal with the customer  You will still have to socialize with people and your bosses but you will primarily be left alone to do your job for a large portion of the day  It's not one I highly recommend though because you need to know how to fight for your rights and maybe deal with some absolutely shitty people  calling HR  talking to higher ups  contacting OSHA  or departments of Fair Employment and Housing  etc    You may also consider finding a job with night shifts  or jobs in calmer settings because retail is NOT CALM  Maybe an office position in reception or customer service  Smaller retail chains  PetsMart  because honestly who ever is an absolute dick in a place that caters to puppies and kittens    What state country are you in  too  If you are passionate about art then get started right now on your education  even if its only one class  You can still work and it may help you in a lot of ways emotionally to be intellectually involved in something outside of work  Start at a community college or city college for your Associates  if in the US  and take a required class one semester and an art class the next  or one art class and requires class  Apply for FAFSA online  apply for a BOG Waiver at your school of choice  always buy used books or rent them and shop around on multiple sites  Apply to Grants and Scholarships  its money you will never need to repay   And take advantage of your schools fitness health services that's paid from your tuition   Pick one thing  right now  to focus on and have a long term goal  If its getting a better job  do that  If its getting more hours  do that  If it's going to school  do that  Take little steps towards the big picture and celebrate your mistakes as lessons learned Fair enough  We all come from different backgrounds and I have quite a bit of non romantic love in my life  so that might be the reason why  I don't feel the lack of romantic love as intensely as others might You're right  everyone has their imperfections  and in the end no one is perfect  I have spent a long time alone  11 years to be precise   over this time I have developed a bitter and cynical personality  Thank you for the kind words  I look forward to hearing more from you That is amazing  congrats   With that kind of a score  push back on universities to give you a shit ton of scholarships  you shouldn't be paying for anything  While I agree that there are no pick up lines that will magically make women  or really  anyone  like you  I do think confidence is real  The fake it 'till you make it  did  actually work for me  so I can vouch for it    although I'd never presume that what worked for me might work for others  since we're all operating under different circumstances  It does take a lot of trial and error  and positive results are never guaranteed  so I can understand your frustration I live in South Africa and where I stay there are zero bus routes  I'm rather a bit removed from any CBD  You need to open with  "We need to talk "  Nothing is more important right now than confronting this behavior and not letting him make excuses  Have his phone in your hands   You need to be calm and supporting  Treat this like you would a drug addiction  alcoholism  or any other form of illness  He needs help   You have to remember this doesn't change who he was to you  Most important thing you must hold on to that  This doesn't change him  He's always been who he is  He is still the same man you love but right now     He needs you   The most important part about the confrontation is that he needs to admit that this behavior is not ok  To get him to do that you need to be as non judgemental as possible but   do not   beat around the bush either   Statements like this should help     Sweetie  I love you  I am disappointed and upset  but I love you  I am here for you  Let's work on this together   The path to address this issue will need to be made by the both of you  His  willing  engagement in his treatment will be the difference between success or failure  He must come to see the error in his ways and  let's face it  we humans do not like shame and some of us will perform all sorts of mental gymnastics in order to avoid being shamed   That said you must be firm  yet supportive  The initial conversation must guide him to the conclusion of  "Thank you for supporting me  I am sorry  This is what we are going to do to get help "  Now  as for what that help is    depends on the both of you  What he needs is really going to be based on him  He may not be comfortable talking to a professional about this or he might    so offer to find the path to recovery together  Let it be a journey that brings you closer together   It's your time to be there for him  now  You can do it  Keep me apprised of how this turns out  You can always come to me for more advice  I'm sorry you went through what you did mate  My father didn't abandon me  he was just away for work most of the time  read  living with a mistress he would later marry   so I lived with my mother and she wasn't the most compassionate person as well  Her and my immediate elder sister  I have other sisters but they were cool I feel similar to how OP is feeling and I have thought about the point you've made about being curious  But the thing is I am in High School and I find it hard to be curious  although usually I am quite curios about things  I just think the people I am in contact with always talk about the same stuff  It is either football soccer   video games or school and that is about it  maybe a couple other things like their part time job or how they are getting on with their drivers licence test but anyone you talk to  basically talks about the same old stuff as the next guy  You can pay for Doctor care out of pocket  Many will charge you less if you are "cash pay"  If you had the money to purchase an inversion table   300 to  3k  then paying for a doctor wasn't completely out of reach  And it sounds like you saw one eventually  if the problem was diagnosed as a slip disk   nerve bundle   Anyway  I'm sorry you went through that    I'm glad you didn't off yourself  but next time go to the ER or urgent care  Jeesh   Suicidal thoughts do not mean you will act on them  but you do need to take them seriously    It can be as easy as talking to your therapist  or making a written safety plan for yourself with lists of supports and activities and what to do if things progress  to as hard as walking in to a psychiatric hospital and asking for help        The main thing to remember  is that you are valued and needed  even if its hard to see through the depression    That remains true Can't seem to find the update for some reason but good for you   You're still young and you have lots of time to improve Thank ya for the reply   I live in Michigan  I've already applied for the FAFSA  and they wouldn't give me anything because both sets of my parents  mom and stepdad   dad and stepmom  make too much  and they aren't going to pay for my college 100   The class I took last semester was  385  and the one I'm taking this semester is  517  tuition   a  211 "fee" for it being a 4 hour class    As for the job  I feel like I shouldn't dislike the one I have now  I have grown to resent any job I have because it takes away my free time and time for things that I actually want to do  painting art   The job itself isn't terrible  except for dealing with customers all day and dealing with greedy managers   I get myself all worked up before I go in  and it makes me hate everything about being there   In the end  I just want to do something that I'm passionate about  I don't have any motivation to restock the same things I just stocked the previous day or make more drinks for rude customers  It's all routine  and the only reason I'm there is because I need the money    and I hate that   That's why I stuff socks into my husband's mouth sometimes or push him until he rolls overOpen up grindr next time you're in the area and find his profile  ask him if you can buy him a coffee    I work at Starbucks and this is how most first dates go  lol That definitely makes sense   If you're on the road to getting better then all I can really say is to just hang in there and give it time   Remember especially that bad days are just bad days and aren't representative of what your whole life will be like   Good luck r wholesomememes trashWell  it is the first part of the house that receives the early morning light  The windows are aluminium  powder coated a dark brown  The colouring may lend to a quicker heating time but I highly doubt that the expansion is enough to set the alarm off  especially considering that I have left the windows closed for some time now  rendering any heat expansion inconsequential I think if you're guaranteed healthcare as a benefit of citizenship  then organ donation should be the default   wish I had the type of social contact you see in films   That's high skill socializing  from both parties  You won't get there without learning from the bottom up and being able to attract the attention of such other people anyway Thanks  dude  It means a lot to me  if you can  i'd say the best option would be to try and get him help  so that maybe he can work through these issues with professionals  going off the way you described him he seems far from a bad person  so it's very likely that this damaged sexuality comes from a much more personal and fragile place  and i wouldn't hesitate to say it's very likely that this could come from abuse that he has personally suffered in the past  if you think it would work  talk to him about it  say you're here to help and that you want the best for him  but also tell him just how it makes you feel and that you want him to go and see professionals  he may feel ashamed and embarrassed at the idea of exposing his secret to even more people but you need to tell him just what's at stake and convince him it's for the best  because it really is  another thing as well  if you do confront him about this get him to delete the pornography on his phone  he could be in very serious trouble if the authorities find out   he doesn't sound like bad guy  he's just damaged  and he needs help  not incarceration  i'm not an expert but this is the best advice i can give Cut ALL contact with her after telling her the facts  She manipulated you with threats of suicide  She demanded to meet  She had some type of episode and claimed she was about about to die  She OK'd the ambulance to take care of HER crisis  which again she claimed was life threatening  This is 100  her doing and 100  her responsibility    You don't pay and don't engage her at all  unless SHe apologies to YOUR satisfaction   With most things in life we screw ourselves over a lot  But it sounds like you're  on the road to correction which is great yo   You handled the situation well  All things considered  You realise there's a problem  Your trying to fix it  You basically already got this on your own   So what if they view you as the girl who messes around with differant guys  you yourself said you're not like that anymore right   My philosophy with these these things is to repair or rebuild whatever fits your situ   my self respect and honor  than that's when I start to build my reputation back up  After that is when taking account of other people's opinions There probably better ways then that but its always worked for me   Other then that all I can tell you is to drop your friendship with these guys and move on a bit wiser   Hope I was of assistance and Good luck   P S  Try not to get wasted until you are considered an adult in your country  legally things can get messy  But I bet you already know that Can I see a picture  Guy in high school had horrible shoes  They smelled like shit from 3m away and everyone laughed at him for it  It was a torture being around him  If mine smelled as bad as his  I'd burn them It comes back to that age old question  Whether it's worth being someone you aren't just so you can be with someone who would not appreciate the real you  I've seen it happen a couple times among people I know at uni and although it 'works' it just doesn't feel right  I can be "loud " like if someone engages me when I'm out and about  snowball's chance in hell  or reciprocates if I engage with them  hahaha   I'll talk with them about anything  I mean I'm holding my hands together to keep from shaking  but I can do it    But it's a rarity that I'd be out and about  and doubly so I'd have the opportunity to talk to someone while being so  Right on man I'm happy for you and I hope it works out Honestly  I have no sympathy for people like her  she could fuck off if I was you  She's an attention whore  I wouldn't even bother helping her  she should go and do whatever she wants Well  I'm glad you had a good experience  but understand you are not in majority  and closed adoptions are frankly part of the problem  in all but very rare circumstances where the mother is deep in a very bad place   I am glad your situation worked out  but do understand there is a vast sea of folks who have not had such a good time as yourself  where laws and rules have prevented reunions where both wanted a reunion  And also men typically have less issues with wanted to see where they came from  Having access to one's medical  genetic  info should be a right in the least   Anyway  good luck to you  and remember your views may change as you get older  you are VERY young right now   And there are services that can help once you are ready to find out more where you came from  depending on the level of bureaucracy one must push against to get the most basic of information  What I'm saying is that you can control the flow of the conversation if you want  You can ask them about whatever you want you don't need to ask them about soccer         I get what you mean though  Since you're in high school people will talk about the same thing a lot because everyone has a job  everyone is getting their license  etc  Still  everyone's experience is different and chances are they'll have different stories to tell  Something funny that happened at work  or something crazy they saw while driving  etc       Heck  if someone who works at a certain place has a shitty manager  and they tell you about it  that's a good thing to know  in case you were thinking of working there  or if someone else you know works there when they talk to you about their job you can say "yeah I heard the manager there sucked blah blah blah" and so on and so forth       Anyways  I don't think that it's wrong to hate small talk  but if you don't want to talk about that all the time then you need to take it upon yourself to find another subject I guess  Conversation is a two way street I think of it this way  some friends I just know I can call if I get thrown out of my apartment  Others I wouldn't even expect to help me with my shoelaces  "I'm sorry I'm new here and am still learning myself  Let's find out together"   I bet your boss will be happy if he finds out Alcohol is not bad when it is consumed in moderation  Just make sure you know your limits and know when to stop I tried to sign up for Obamacare but  their individual plan for me alone would cost more than my husband's employer offered family plan  We can't afford his employer offered plan and so we surely can't afford Obamacare  Our subsidy was a joke and now we are facing a  1300 penalty come April  Some of that will be offset by what they have withheld from my husband's check but  we're still looking at at least  300 to  400 out of pocket  Something else we can not afford  Thank you for your kind words  Do whatever the process is  even if it seems stupid or ineffecient  Listen and ask for help from people who have been there longer  Your first answer should always be yes if the request is coming from your boss  Coffee  Sure  I will get it  Copies  Sure  I will do that  Manual data entry  Sure  I will do that  The only talk back you get is to inform them of impacts on other projects so they can prioritize    "I need copies and these things made into a binder " "Sure thing  Just so I know  doing that is probably going to force me to push back completing that data entry you wanted  Which one is the priority "Economic contract of union Congrats  you should have plenty of options as to college and some good merit scholarship opportunities   What are your plans I feel you I think similarly when reading about how hateful some people are towards others  I feel that most of them are just projecting their unhappiness or maybe are just ignorant All of your responsibilities are never covered in the job interview  Make sure you look and do what they need  even if it isn't what they immediately asked for or is in your responsibility list  Same  My HR always sends out engagement wedding announcements too  It's just another reminder that I can't get a second date It's weird to me how popular the ACT has become in recent years   When I was in high school ages ago in TX  the ACT was virtually unheard of  more of a Midwest thing   Now it seems to be on par if not ahead of the SAT in many areas Ugh thankfully my workplace only does that with birthdays lol This immediately makes me think of when I make a mistake while driving and cut someone off or something  I did it on a small roundabout before   during traffic I pull out thinking she was exiting the roundabout and the lady beeps her horn  pops her head out of her window and says "WHAT THE F    ARE YOU DOING    " While I'm thinking ok that was an honest mistake  I thought she was exiting the roundabout before me but I should have waited and also that was a slight over reaction  we're going about 2mph  the roundabout is tiiiiiny  you can't go over 10mph on it without losing control  but I still thought about it for about a day and a half     While this doesn't affect my productivity when I realise I'm thinking about it too much I think 'why am I allowing this really irrelevant situation to occupy so much time in my life  she's probably forgot about it  nothing I can do now' over and over until I realise I'm right   When I'm really emotional I watch an episode of a funny show which has relatively short episodes  like 20 mins   if I'm really really emotional like crying all over the place I either watch a film which isn't sad and see how I feel afterwards or just try to sleep it off and make up for lost time tomorrow    If it's something that deeply troubling you I think you shouldn't repress it  you should have a little cry and just address it with rational words until you think 'oh yeah I've been completely irrational'I'm glad you got it together man and right now I'm working on bettering myself too  My main problem is confidence  which I hope to improve soon Damnnn daniel he get too smash a cetaceaExplain to me how giving vouchers so that vets can go other treatment centers is equal to privatization   This sub is so biased That's true love  Well  Maybe we should take the death row philosopher's teachings with a grain of salt  considering the context The suicide hotline can be incredibly helpful if it ever gets really dark  I had to call once recently and it did help me think more clearly  I often find when I'm in that frame of mind  I have become so overwhelmed with negative thoughts I just don't see the point and can't find any solutions other than f    all of this  Give them a call before you do anything or lean too much into those thoughts  They are incredibly nice and that was enough to help stop the cycle of thoughts ok I see what you mean and you are right  I should be interested in other peoples experiences  I find it very very hard though I usually forget what they have told me the next time I see them  wtf  american tv shows are nutsThank you sm it really means alot to me   Call the policeEven though you've been a cock to me the last few days i'll still help you out here  My previous stepdad was an abusive alcoholic  Every couple nights or so he would get drunk and do shit i don't really feel comfortable sharing  anyways  i personally think alcohol turns you into a completely different person when abused  I think you should be fine  as it seems she may have just had a little to much to drink and got a little clumsy   EDIT  Have a happy new year man Just sensationalist titles  And what the fuck do you care that much for  clucker You've only supplied a little bit of information so keep that in mind but   You may have a touch off attention deficit disorder  as it looks similar to people in my life with it  including the panicky in large groups aspect  I'm not a doctor  but it's something to research to see if it describes your situation  and you can get help for  Try r ADHD  Otherwise keep trying different things until one sticks   You'll find something that grabs you and doesn't let go  It might be something unexpected  however   You were dying of alcohol poisoning and her friends thought your delusional and painful ramblings were cause for a breakup       I can only hope my girlfriend won't be angry at me when I'm dying and delusional  Mild panic sets in every time reddit goes down for maintenance and I can't see my lonely fellows  or my dank memesLol  I just told him and he got defensive saying he doesn't snore and he was just super tired  Still cute tho I never saw a Dr  but because of how it worked so well and since I have never felt better back wise since using the Teeter consitently since 2014   I researched what I came to conclude was the cause of  this and from my  obviously non professional opinion  none other possibilities could been fixed completley using an inversion bed and how I have not any issue since some of that is due to my now vigilant effort in following well thought out and  comprehensive  pre workout warmup that I never skip or leave anything out for time issues as I really was shown how important I have keep my ability to hike and workout and do everything I would be devastated if I ever lose the ability to do them   I admire all the people overcome setbacks and disabilites that just shows how strong they are and are suvivors who just don't anything keep them down no matter what   If I ever can't walk or be able hike with my dog or anything like that  I just know from how scared and inability to see a reason that would allow to accept that just from that little over month time and  I know it shows how weak I am in this one area that I just have to be careful do whatever I can to prevent it or I'm not going last for very long    It may be have been different had been able to keep others in my life instead just through some bad unexpected circumstances it's just me and my dog now  no one else at all I'm in contact and I've peace with that but it has made that ability to do whatever physically so I can keep my outlook at least not depressed because how I've always loved hiking with every dog I've had in nature and alone that it  still is enough for me to not be sad about isolation Great one      Thanks  Are you close to your family  Any close friends  I know it sucks but it would probably be best to move on and keep low contact or no contact with him  I really appreciated it when a friend sent flowers to the hospital for me after my surgery  so that's another idea It's possible it's nothing more than denial  I don't feel like the other deaths are examples of this being who you are or how you deal with death  If you've only texted and talked to ppl related to this loss and not seen the loss face to face  it could be maintaining an emotional distance  Obviously  I don't know anything but I have felt this way before and after some time  found myself wrecked  Denial and keeping a distance are excellent ways to avoid feelings  I was doing some cognitive behavior therapy through my university   I was surprised to find that I was already using all of the tactics that were presented to me in therapy  I guess I'm weird that way  I stopped going partly because they use interns who will only be with you for a semester and I didn't want to start over again and partly because I hear that if they find out you're suicidal  you get kicked out of school  If I get kicked out  there's no way I will finish  I believe that it is a result of my epilepsy which has worsened due to the demands of being a student  I plan to start trying meds that treat both over the summer  when it's okay if it doesn't go well  If there's an employee who seems to be trying to befriend you  and you notice he talks very lowly of the boss and the other employees  avoid this person like the plague no matter how convincing they sound  They are on thin ice probably and are resenting their job  don't let that person effect your job     Every job has that one person  I was in the same boat when I was your age  I'm 32 so it wasnt tooo long ago   I felt your pain  The good thing is that youre doing all the things I never did like reading up on it and watching g videos and stuff   There were a few things I realized as part of growing up   First you can not sound desperate when talking to women  You may not be but I know I had to work on it myself because the stress of not having that someone was getting to me when I was younger   Second  is that girls love confident men  Confidence isn't just about being able to talk to women  it's also about knowing yourself and what you like and dislike  It's being able to suggest a next date location with a fun activity instead of "is there anything you like to do for fun "  Finally  I understand your frustrations with texting  but remember not everyone has free time the same time you do either   It's a brand new year  join a dating site  you sound like a resourceful guy with everything he needs to make it happen this year This depends on the laws where you live    If the law states that professionals must report owners of child porn to the police   then do not bring him to a shrink unless you want the police involved    I would take said phone   Talk to his parents  if they are mentally healthy individuals     show them the pics   End the relationship   move out  never ever look back    If his parents are not the people to deal with this and you don't want the police  involved   then you need to have this talk with him   And run    Studies have shown that these desires are hard to get rid of   At best he will be spending most of his life trying to suppress them    Post surgery  when the fragments started to pass they got caught in the tube between the kidney and the bladder  The pain was EXCRUCIATING  I woke up at 6 AM going "something is wrong  like really really really wrong "Take a DNA test and see where you can go from there  It would probably be your only hope now wouldn't a manger get tired of you having to ask them or co workers Here's some real advice to you  Stop drinking    holy shit  How hard is that  Clearly it happened before and you still drinking  Maybe you just like having the excuse of being drunk to act the way you act  Even if I was confident and outspoken  I still can never think of anything to say  I'm a much better listener than talker  so in groups I tend to be the quiet lurker on the edge of the groupAh  jeez  friend  That's rough  It seems like you have the right idea   maybe do a part time online college or MOOCS  I'm sorry that school wasn't the right place for you  and that it pushed you to the limit so hard I think body shaming is when someone else makes you feel ashamed of your body  not when you personally are ashamed of you body because you don't like they way it looks  thats more self conscious  Like lets say as you said someone avoids going swimming  they don't feel comfortable because what they think of their body  any person in the same vicinity of them could think that they looked completely fine and not as bad as that person thinks they looked  idk I'm drunk though so probably not wording it right and probably don't listen to me lol1 Do you mean girls with fake body parts   If yes  the problem here is not the snapchat account  it is that you VIOLATED his intimacy    You get it  If you felt necessary to snoop his Reddit account secretly  then there is a problem in your relationship in the first place  Have you ever thought of that  On top of everything  you also found something that could mean your husband's sex life is not that good  Again  another relationship problem    Communicate more with your husband  see what he needs  Maybe he needs a good fuck and you haven't given it to him lately    What do you think  Is she in a state with Medicaid  Free therapy while she has no low income yes  what else do you think marriage is and always was The show is fake The problem is that sooner or later I slip and act kindly or confess humanity or don't tell her to eff off when she acts nasty   I'm also not the best at acting manly because of my stupid hormones  and often realize only later how I was supposed to act to make her horny  Luckily I sleep like a log   So I don't often hear mine   but when I'm trying to get over to sleep  it's not good heh   Been with mine for 20 years Don't believe the comment below about it being snapchat's fault  Just got the phone and the camera is way bad  But I came from a Note 5 that has a 16mp rear camera and the front cameras are supposed to be the same  but the quality is not  Please do  I'm more than happy to help you get through this if I can This is just a general information point for readers of the sub   I genuinely wasn't familiar with the term  I'm guessing I'm not the only one      According to this "RationalWiki"    "cultural marxism" is a term popularized by Nazis    referring to an alleged conspiracy to topple Western culture  http   rationalwiki org wiki Cultural Marxism  The Nazis' definition of "legitimate help" includedmurdering about 70 000 disabled people  among other things  https   www ushmm org research research in collections search the collections bibliography people with disabilitiesOh  here's another thing I forgot to mention   She isn't a citizen    I'm not clear on her status as a legal resident  I suspect she has either a student visa  green card  or nothing at all True but I'm referring to the audience  which is real  They were gasping when she said she's an 18 year old virginEw  that's a deal breaker for me   I'd break up with him for sure and he'd have a hard time trying to convince me to not call the police Yes  I agree with you 100   She'll very seriously say "you don't love me   " if I haven't told her within a couple of hours  She lost trust in people as a whole  see my previous post on relationships for a crazy story  when her family did something to hurt her  Yeah that snoring isn't so cute when you a few years in and sleep deprived because your SO has sleep apnea and doesn't take care of it  then you also have that newborn that wakes every 2 fucking hours  But don't let me shit on anyone's happiness Yes  focus on looking past the surgery and into the future  plan things in  The this surgery won't feel like it might be the end of the world  but something that's necessary and then she'll be back on her feet  figuratively  I mean your actual shoe  If they're all dirty and worn out just throw them away Sounds like a lesson in 'caring people take suicidal threats seriously'  Even faking suicidal threats is dangerous behavior because someone who does that is very unbalanced and unpredictable  Real or fake  you did the only thing anyone can do   get her secure and safe  A licensed therapist would've had to call emergency  And therapists don't get billed by the hospital  Unfortunately our healthcare system is expensive  but you didn't create that system  You don't owe her for taking her seriously     Don't take on this debt  explain you will always take her threats seriously and call authorities to keep her safe   It was 5 years into our relationship before my now wife told me i snored  I was like  no way do l  I'd snored since we met  You should contact the police  he always has the option of getting a social worker  and a therapy team to help rehabilitate him  However  he has crossed certain lines that can't be undone  If you care about him  you'll contact the police in the interest of protecting those kids he's looking at  Legally you aren't really going to be on the hook for anything  you didn't seek out the photos and happened upon them by chance  You not saying anything however  that's what puts you in hot water  I'm sorry OP  but keeping quiet on this isn't an option  Everyone eventually gets caught  and the last thing you want is to get involved when it gets messy  He has more options if he just turns himself in  but I don't know what kind of guy he is  There is help out there  but right now a phone call to the police is more important than anything Have you been to a counselor or sought therapy  You have all the symptoms I had in school  being moody and depressive  having a general pessimistic and cynical outlook on life  It was hard as fuck going through adolescence with that outlook  What helped me was medication and changing my perspective on life  I learned to find things that interested me  found hobbies and outlets for my energy   It wasn't all good though  I still struggled with confidence issues all the way through college  I always expected to be asked to be included  I know now I lost out on a lot of opportunities because I didn't try to actively engage with others  If others don't see you the way you want to be seen  make them see you by seeking them out yourself   Finally  it's hard not to get discouraged when shit doesn't work the way you expect  This is where your hard work ethic will come in handy  You just have to stick with it   It's 2017  you have a whole year and lifetime ahead to do great thingsI'm skinny  always been skinny  no girl aside from a couple of crazy   broken ones found me attractiveNo problem   Stay strong and make it a good year It is one of thousands of interchangable songs  Just find one that is similar and call it good  There is zero special about it  I get almost 0 matches despite making a fake profile of a hot chad  and there are barely any active female users  italy is still in the 1800sHaha yeah I get what you mean but I don't think that anyone expects you to remember everything you tell them       Anyways  I was just trying to share what works for me  but everyone's different you just have to figure out what works for you  I'm definitely not an expert or anything I'm just trying to help or at least show a different perspective       When it comes to social interactions long as you're happy and the people you talk to are happy then you've won as far as I'm concerned   Thank you for posting to  r helpmecope  While you wait for users to post and help you  please take a

not killing myself  With mental health its easy to look at it as two things  the chemical imbalance and the state of mind  Let the state of mind overcome the chemical imbalance and then atleast it will be some what tolerable  think of the people who love you even if it doesn't seem that way  If you can think of the people who are there around you and still want to die at the same time then i say professional help is needed  but who am i to give someone mental health advice without a licence  just off experience Apparently this guy was having multiple surgeries to fix his heart but he still found the strength to fight the normies  Guy's life was on the line but he was still fighting  The REEE is strong in him   I know I'm just a stupid Redditor but you stole my heart Can you describe what you mean by office cliques and why to stay out of it in the workforce  Asking because I feel my workplace is very cliquey and I don't like it but am trying to learn how to deal with itI'm not sure why you  should  logically have any rights to your body when you cease to exist as a person  It's just emotion that made that the norm  I have no idea how the UK works so a lot of this could be very wrong but  It sounds like you guys have some sort of social security there such as https   www gov uk jobseekers allowance  where you get money while searching for jobs for example  You could probably get your friend to talk to either these people or some sort of charity  we have stuff like st vincent de paul and salvation army and stuff   Tell them he has been kicked out and has nothing to his name and nowhere to go  in where I live they're usually helpful if its for emergency relief situation   Hopefully one of them will place him with some sort of social worker and hopefully temporary shelter that can help get him on track with his new circumstances  Ideally the assistance from the UK should give him enough to become self dependent in rent and obtain a job to keep himself going   I'm assuming money is the problem here mostly because otherwise he could just start renting a very cheap crummy place for say 6 months until he can get back on his feet  Though I may have missed the point of the question It's kinda weird  but it's not pervy or anything  I sold my soul to Cthulu for comfort  He ended up giving me tentacles and now I am an established Japanese pornstar    Follow your dreams  You're fine  Everyone I know  including my parents  have done it  As long as you're comfortable and it doesn't seep into other aspects of your life  like affecting your grades or your ability to function  you're good man This is an issue that is beyond your control  You can seek advice from your family or your friends but that is not going to resolve the problem here  You are still young and although you love him  you still have a chance at having a healthy relationship with someone who is not going to put your relationship in danger  or any children you may have in the future  Your boyfriend needs to seek the professional help of a psychologist or therapist and hope that by revealing this information that he doesn't wind up with criminal charges and jail time    I advise you get out before you become an accessory  Do not forget you are fully aware that your boyfriend has illegal pornographic images of children in his possession  You can also be held responsible for not reporting this  I also wanted to add  back years ago when I dated a guy who was a drug addict I used the same excuse as you are using here "But he has helped me through all of my issues and stayed by my side  How could I leave him when he needs me " You know what  Thats bullshit  Your boyfriend has helped you with issues that commonly need help while his issues are super illegal and just awful since children are involved  Think about that  Had this problem a couple months ago  Pull an all nighter then go to sleep the next day around 9 or 10 pm Ask something  and when it's your turn to reply  comment on something they've said  Then ask another question  Never keep the ball on your court  If it works out  suddenly you're having a full on conversation   even with a stranger    Sometimes despite your best efforts though  the conversation dies or feels one sided  There's not much you can do about that One thing I learned was  when asking a question  it's good to be prepared with an answer you already have on what you think the solution may be  It shows you put thought into it  but of course don't ramble on if the situation calls for short questionsAre you friends and would you like to keep in touch Sorry to hear that  he sounds disgusting    If you wanted to out this guy then I would suggest you need to try and get him to admit to what he did so you have some evidence  However clearly in order to pull something off where you can get some evidence would require you to be very careful so he didn't realise what was going on    The obvious things would be to secretly record him on a call or maybe secretly film him  Or maybe just get him to admit what happened over text  could you contact him on WhatsApp and discuss what happened with him and so have text evidence   I appreciate this may raise other issues particularly if it went wrong but depending on who you felt about 'outing him' then it could be an option Me  Whooooh    WAIT    oh    Ahhhh  This is what I needed  Really  thank you so much  I'm probably going to go back every now and then to read this            A lot of what I'm saying more so relates to the real world  but if you can start applying it now you will be so much better off in the long run            You probably already stated this somewhere but I just wanna make sure  How do you start now What do you do now to make yourself better in the long run         School doesn't give you very much freedom because your forced to do the same things everyday  This is very un natural to some people like yourself  but it was these thoughts  memories and experiences that were amplified and directed once i got out of school          This makes a lot of sense  I'm now in high school and the first week or so I felt so good about myself and so confident  it was almost like the feeling I had two weeks ago  It was because of the amount of freedom I had in the high school compared to the junior high  at least I think so          Yeah  I'm already known in my school throughout some groups  I'm active in the school plays in such  and get leads   but I guess that's not really the problem  schools cool  except for the work  but when it comes to teachers and adults  then man  you got meee  It's also the fact that I suck at making conversation   but only with adults  I feel like it doesn't make any sense for people my age to ask about their life  that's just weird  They should ask about  my  life  lol  not conceited       And ha  my generation is a little bit screwed up  About a quarter of the really annoying "cool jocks" are actually genuises  They somehow know their stuff when it comes to school and act like it takes nothing  What about  "The cafe on       enter street name here"   Ie  The Cafe on Main The Cafe on 5th  r stopdrinkingOh  and babies too After reading the top comments I have to say there seems to be some odd advice here     Regardless of your feelings towards him and what he means to you  you HAVE to report this to the police  Failure to report this will make you an accomplice  and you could be in legal trouble depending on your local laws  Even if that wasn't the case you should still report it  Child porn is not a victimless crime  Those girls in those photos are being severely abused  The police may be able to trace those photos to the source and help those kids  Furthermore  do you want to be with someone that's like that  What are you going to do if you get pregnant  What if you have a daughter and he assaults her sexually  What if your friend  sister  brother  etc  has kids and he's left alone with them  What about when he is caught  Because they always get caught  Do you want the fallout from his crime affecting you  What if he harms a girl and you could have stopped it    I'd suggest going to your local police station and filing a report  Call your parents friends etc  and have a place to stay ready  The police may have you bring them the phone or allow you to search the house  They may ask you not to leave right away so as not to alert her  Try to cooperate but remember your own safety first and foremost  It's always better to pack up the essentials when he is work and leave  if your planning to leave      Your other option  which isn't that great  is to confront him on the topic and see if he is willing to get help  But I know if I was in a similar situation I couldn't trust that     Visitation rights in hospitals  a commitment to stay together Your mother sounds very selfish and may be emotionally abusive  You wanting to know your genetic history should have nothing to do with her personal emotions about an individual   Anyway  my only thought is perhaps the hospital you were born at has records of who was listed as your genetic father  I'm honestly not sure if they keep those kinds of records around  but it might be worth a phone call   It's also possible that your mother's ex husband knows your father's name  if you can  respectfully  get in contact with him to ask Well it was deleted from Personal finance We are friends and will keep in touch  but not really often by house visits since even as neighbors we didn't frequent each others homes too much  just usually send across some food  gifts  etc If I were you I would speak to my parents and let them advise me of how to go about this  They may tell you to lock it away or they may speak to your cousins parents to come up with the best possible solution  as they are going to want to protect their daughter from marrying a creep   Don't just forget it if you care about your husband No because confidence   ugliness   creepinessAll males  suffering from erectile dysfunction may improve their sexual capabilities by taking Filitra 20 40 60mg medication  Generic Vardenafil is the main ingredient of Filitra   Inventing a time machine would be a nice first move   sYou're still in school so I guess you already talk to girls from your classroom  Talking to people  not just girls  randomly is indeed weird unless there's something in common to talk about  I would say talk to the girls you're in class with more  That could lead to you getting to know other girls sometimes  Also what do you assume will get easier as you get older I'm going to add that you definitely need to seek out an authority figure  Child pornography is not a victimless crime  It's up to you then  If they are friends  and you want to  let them know your new address  Probably will mean Christmas cards   If you don't want to then don't  There is no social rule with neighbors  It's more if they are a friend or not Cats don't do that unless there is a problem  My perfectly normal and active kitty started doing that one day  He would have push out a long and low meow if I petted him  He was vomiting and he wasn't responding to me  Well after a day of this I rushed him to the ER vet  They found nothing on the X ray and I was stunned  My cat's eyes were wet and red around the eye  He was still not himself  I rushed him to another vet the next day since he started to deteriorate  Turns out he had thread tangled in his intestines and caused a blockage  It ran from his tongue to his intestines  He needed immediate surgery and fortunately survived  Now I know what to look out for  If your cat is acting out of the norm then get him checked because something is wrong I don't know  that sounds like a way to get teased about being suicidal  These folks sound like real assholes  I would honestly just calmly leave a situation like that I don't know or I don't care  We have an I Don't Care Bar and Grill near by my house  The name is great but the foods kinda meh ideally 10 or so years younger tbhToday there is easy divorce  so it's not much of a committment  Depending on the country marriage was about paying to buy the woman  or getting paid to take the burden of mantaining the woman off the family You'll need to take it to a lawyer  get three quotes for repair and three for replacement of the vehicle and use the cheapest to form the basis of your civil suit  I am more suicidal than have ever been but this neurodoversity round up made me feel like I

lifetime   Thank you Id go either way in age   beggars cant be choosersFirst  you need to let yourself grieve  Cry  Take hot bubble baths  Read trashy magazines  Eat chocolate and ice cream  Allow yourself to be sad    Secondly  remember that it's ok and normal to miss them but not want them back in your life    It's going to get harder before it gets easier but you will get over him  You will get through this  You will move on  You will be ok  I had a friend in highschool who said she wouldn't want to be an organ donor because she wanted to have an open casket funeral  We were fourteen  she must have heard this absurd idea from adults in her life  Misinformed adults who don't understand the things they are talking about  Can you tell me any actual drawbacks  I hate to break it to you but there's nothing inherently special about your corpse  You  are  just a meat bag  that's real Wouldn't mind   10 years older Please point to me where in international law it says that you retain the basic human right to your body after you die I feel the same way  I don't even know what I want anymore  I've sat down multiple times and just tried to think "what would make me happy " Haven't come up with an answer yet   They can only do what the law states    So any purpose the government sees fit In group talk you will rarely hear any pauses  I'm a guy so this might be gender specific  but when I have something to say I sort of breathe in and lean forward to give everyone a non verbal clue that it's my turn to speak now  Sounds super weird when I describe this  but usually works  if the audience is not too drunk anyway I did  don't tell certain subs on Reddit or ill be compared to hitler   sAlright  I will look out for that    Thanks That's a good one    Definetely gonna try that That is her responsibility  If she was in her right mind then she would have calmed down and came out to talk to you  Having a panic attack does not warrant for immature behavior  I've had panic attacks before and all I want is for someone to comfort me and calm me down  If she didn't want the ambulance to show up she should have come out and asked to leave the restaurant  You were worried about her health and wellbeing  not knowing what she would do since she threatened suicide   Had she taken it further and hurt herself then you would have felt guilty  Refuse to pay the bill  She shouldn't have even asked  I hate to say it but she sounds like someone who has a classic case of wanting attention That's so sad inb4   Yeah me and my girlfriend really hate those threads   there's nothing inherently special about your corpse  Sure there is   It's MY corpse   What is done with it should be MY decision   There are plenty of religious or personal beliefs that may not align with what the government has made default    A healthy body and healthy mind is very important to live a healthy and graceful life  by use of some health and wellness practices you make your life healthy and enjoy every second of it  To live a good and happy life we should eat a healthy diet with daily routine of doing exercise  Best way to start your day is with breakfast that is not only healthy but rich in protein  You need to provide your body some fuel  if you do not have time to make breakfast then eat some fruits and drink milk  Eating healthy is one of the main key to living a long and happy life  We all are very busy these days and sometime we dont have time to prepare healthy meal then we use fast food which is not good for our health I would agree that suffering does not necessarily cause cruelty  but I believe it often does   It's not enough to dismiss a person for being cruel   We should ask ourselves why they're cruel  while  of course  protecting ourselves from the cruelty in the meantime  I'm pretty sure they have cue cards Imagine if I told them 32 ish  They would drop dead 18 year old female virgin     18 year old male virginYou absolutely need to master swimming in a pool before attempting this in an ocean  Pools are controlled environments  There's a very minor current at most and it won't pull you away like a rip tide or a strong current in an ocean  Pool water is cleaner and easier to see  helping you become comfortable opening your eyes in the water  which is ultra important  I'm a swim instructor and my recommendation would be to slowly progress through swimming in a pool  When you can go the full length of the pool twice without stopping  besides to turn around of course  then you're a safe enough swimmer to go in an ocean and be able to get out  If you need to  look into learning from a swim teacher or a friend who knows how to swim well  Good luck  What about the school's mental health facilities Yes  I was thinking "you and millions of other humans   "Yeah  I honestly don't get the talk of chemical castration we get here  People talk about it as if it will remove any desire for a girlfriend  but all it will do is remove your desire for sex  you'll still be lonely I'll have to agree  my initial statement was too broad  I know I've done some pretty mean things as a result of past trauma  However  in OP's case  "I  abusive thing  because you  something innocent or integral to your identity " is textbook abuse excuse   Going back up to OP  I hope your situation improves  I hope that your mother realizes what she's been doing to you and makes a change  or she stays out of your life until she's able to get better  You don't deserve this kind of treatment   Not at all  but like with most things social skills related  it entirely depends how you do it and what the intent behind your actions and energy is saying    In other words  if you are starting conversations by just being friendly and casual  maybe by making observations  asking genuine questions about school interests etc   with the intent of just getting to know them  you'll be successful in making friends and won't come off as creepy  again  provided you are being genuine   No  I mean transgendered    The sub the post came from is one for people who have male genitals but identify as or otherwise appear female  and for those who appreciate them     There are many reasons he might have saved the post  and yes  of course his interest in it  and my inclination to snoop are both indications of relationship issues   I didn't think it was necessary to acknowledge that in my post     My request was for advice on how to talk to him about it   I'm not angry or presuming anything at all   I'm just worried and confused and looking for any useful guidance on approaching this sensitive issue   i think some of it is dopamine issues  constantly stressed and no positive reinforcement  brain not going to release any for motivation  there is porn but then after fapping one is left even worse off because there is no drive lol  why it's hard some days to get into anime and gaming   REEE Oh okay thanks  Yeah I just didn't know if it was a social ruleMaybe talk to him first and give him warning and a chance to get rid of it before completely ruining his life  His life will be over once he is turned into the police  If he helped OP through difficult times  even through meth addiction  it would be cold and IMO wrong to just turn him into to jail right now  effectively destroying his life with  such a record  As fucked up as CP is  he is still a person  and if you care about this person  you have to give him a chance and at least talk to him about it first   To OP  I urge you to sit down and have a talk about what you found with your boyfriend  Talk about how illegal it is  what the consequences are and tell him he needs to get rid of it now and get help  Find any resources you can for people like him in the area  show him to a therapist  etc    and then  you should seriously consider ending the relationship  As much as you love him  it is probably best to leave him  he has his own demons he needs to work out and you deserve to be happy  It would be very emotionally draining and difficult for you to stay  You not calling the police and talking to him about getting help should be your last act of love before moving on  Good luck Now go out there and show the world what a badass you are Every now and again  a post shows up on here that's just beautiful to read    Good on you  OP  Hope you have better luck in love going forward Removed  this is better suited for  r relationshipsI guess Tinder over there must be very different to how it is in the UK  Though it's a woman's game anywhere  I've seen some old female friends use it  and any guy they swipe right on  they get a match  Go back to therapy   You are a perfect candidate for therapy  please get help  If you find a therapist that isn't helping you  try a new therapist  Repeat until one works  Don't give up  Fight for your right to be well   I am so sorry your life has not been kind to you  No one should have to feel this way  but we have to deal with the consequences anyway    See if you can get back on meds     If not  you'll want to give your body and mind the best chance it can to fight depression and that is in keeping yourself healthy in all other ways  Nutrition  exercise  sleep  socializing  productivity  Meditation is always good too   One thing to know  depression brain doesn't know what's good for it and must be ignored and we must act in the opposite way  It will say " hanging out with people sounds terrible" but if we go out and have fun we will actually feel better  Depression is the disease where you just have to do the things that feel impossible to do  no biggie   sarcasm  You already know wrestling helps keep it at bay  GOOD   Don't stop   Exercise is crucial in staving off depression and you've got that covered   Lactic acid directly impacts the part of your brain your depression messes with  motivation     Eat nutritious food  Learn what makes your mood feel better by watching how categories of food make your feel  carbohydrates  proteins  fats  and fiber  High sugar diets are known for making depression really bad  Indeed  if I eat junk food too much for too long my mood is destroyed  I fix it by eating something with tons of veggies  spices  and ingredients in general  Pay attention and you'll see the connection   Socialize  make sure to have good times with friends regularly  Even good interactions with strangers can make one feel connected    Sleep good  don't miss a good nights sleep or your brain will be too much of a mess to keep itself together   Productivity  by getting things done we feel empowered  and depression is a disease of powerlessness  So if you get depressed and don't want to do anything  like chores or whatever  accomplishing them will actually feel good   When in dire straits to feel better  actually  help someone else   Kind acts out of the blue  or working for an important cause  By focusing on someone else's well being and happiness we don't feel our own distress  but we do feel empowered     Meditation is a healing balm for the mind  Look up mindfulness meditation techniques  Meditation will help you focus your mind on the thoughts you want  not the bad ones   Like a muscle  you get better at it over time with practice   If you get all of these under control  your brain will be the most healthy it can be  and you can more easily tackle life's challenges to make your life REALLY great  Any other mental issues beyond that are what medication and therapy are for    I hope you can start a life for yourself out on your own  Hang in there and don't give up  if you dont' give up success is inevitable eventually    I used to think that was my problem  Ended up getting in shape and making friends  It made it a lot easier    Then I found out my problem wasnt confidence and that I never go out  I'm not much a fan of small talk either  When I get to talking with people  it's either brief spouts of what I muster up  or it's balls deep conversation  this is how it was described to me  that will either make people very uncomfortable or make them feel a deeper connection with me in some way  That is the thing about conversation though  You should say what you mean and mean what you say  Small talk is poison to real conversing  What is the issue here  Depends  If the person is giving you small talk to try to work into a true conversation  you will see it  and that's great  Don't be afraid to be open up as long as you're not sharing secrets  If they're just making small talk because they are fearful of being caught alone  you don't have to meet to some standard of conversation  Just be kind with whatever you're saying  They'll either understand or they won't  It is not your fault that you aren't a fan of meaningless conversation  My main strategy is making something meaningful out of the meaningless  Whether they're open or not  I would have gotten my point across  If they are though  well  it seems you're in for a good talk  I hope this makes sense  I tend to rant and externalize things at times  but I am just trying to help explain them  I suppose if you wanted to start something meaningful in meaningless small talk  speak what's in your heart  not in your mind  That's what really matter to you  Even if it is veiled by a mind trying to make sense of it  With love   EDIT  To add to this  I know you're looking for specific advice on the matter of children conversation  but you shouldn't feel ashamed for not having them  even if it isn't relatable  You don't need to explain yourself on the matter  but it may give you an opportunity to share a bit about why you chose not to have kids and how it has affected your life  for better and for worse  People are more drawn to a unique scenario than one that seems like a carbon copy of all the rest  Just share your heart        Thank you for the information  I hadn't considered the long term effects of alcohol addiction  but it makes sense  considering how long she has been been drinking  Best wishes to you Honestly  you terrified everyone  Her friends are probably freaking out  and I think yours would do the same if you and your gfs roles were reversed  I mean someone who she lives and who cherishes her acted awful towards her  even though it wasn't really you   I think that you should give her a day or two to breathe it off  no contact and then maybe ask her if you could treat her to a fancier dinner or something cute  She obviously still loves and cares for you since she took care of you  she's just shook up right now  As are you  Who wouldn't be  Be sure to thank her for taking care of you  wait a bit and do something cute for her or buy her her favorite candy and bring it to her  As a girl I think that would really help   I think it'll work out  just do something to show her you love her and let her breathe  You fucked up  you survived  thank god  and she took care of you  You two aren't the first to go through this  many other couples have survived things like this   Also that sounds so incredibly scary  I'm glad nothing worse happened  She wasn't angry at him during  just after  That's different  With any substances  you'll most likely regret doing them at a young age Haha  that's fucking hilarious  Good shit I'm sure that there are a good amount of men still using tinder here  but almost no women  and those who do still are not there for hookup Sorry doesn't replace trust  Remember you did look into her texts without her permission  That isn't how love  respect and trust work  Maybe she'll change for a month or three  but that lingering trust issue will plague you  I really hope you all the best  I'm sorry that that has happened to you   Deep breath and small steps moving forward  Wish you the best  OP Youre young   Weight can be lost  I know people in highschool that could be labeled as "weird" or "losers" that went on to date many people others are now married   17 is too young to conclude that youre fa     Dont listen to what your family says   Actually dont listen to what mostly anyone says   People are fucking stupid   Just look at the world we live in   People that can throw a ball pretty well you can make signicantly more money than engineers and doctors Thank you  that makes me feel somewhat better  I really don't know what to make of it all  over at  r relationships I was told  rightfully so  by everyone that I'm an idiot and am lucky she's still with me so some kind words are nice to read haha This I could never deal with snoring omg I'm so sensitive  but all the more power to ya  Luckily my bf doesn't snore except when he's sick  and then we are both miserable Ask them about what they like to do  I can talk for hours about the shit I do and I'll be into the whole time too  I'll be shouting about it I think its the opposite just on new years eve there was a post that was crawling with normies handing out there "advice" I even got into an argument with another normie about how mental illness isn't like a form of thinking  Most of them come and just talk about how much sex they've had and how easy it was and how you should be able to do it only to get mad at you if you don't follow it  especially sucks in your 20's  hah  you think it's difficult now  but at least you still have youth on your side  Give it a decade    And jesus h christ I don't even want to think about the poor saps in their 40s and 50s and beyond   Don't forget to shower before the first date Honestly I don't care what happens to her so long as she is removed from our lives  I've tried so many times to help her  I'm not even sure an intervention would help  Maybe with professional help  maybe I dont think youre bitter i think its just people trying to boost their own ego   Or maybe im just bitter tooThis seems to be the consensus  It's the advice my granddad gave me  Thank you Congratulations  Why would they want to help people here in the first place  To have more competition LOL  made my day    It's just one of those social signalling things  like "I was driving in my BMW" when the story doesn't involve the car at all  Most probably don't even realize they're doing it  there's just a subconscious drive to mention shit you think is impressive to other people so they'll like you Wat is disWhat is your differentiating factor    Why would people go to your café instead of somewhere else    Location  Food quality  Service  Good place for people to work    You can use that as a basis for your name I guess it depends on what travelling factors are most important to you  If managing your costs within a tight budget is a top factor here  I would recommend the Canadian national Parks  I see from your post history that you're Canadian so I'm sure you know that our national parks are free to enter this year due to it being our 150th bday  Since camping and hiking are relatively low cost anyway  and since you'll save on admissions  I can definitely see you being able to finagle all of the Canadian cities on your list in to the same trip  depending on how much time you have     Also  the federal government and most provincial governments will be pouring a whole pile of money in to event programming year round all over the country  This means New and enhanced festivals  shows  activities and other public events in cities and small communities all year long  Some major cities  such as Ottawa  are dropping big dough on this stuff as well  For that reason  this year will prove to be an exciting one everywhere you go so you could choose to arrange your travel plans to hit some of these as well  Come summertime 150 events will be hard to avoid    All of your European cities are absolutely worth seeing  Reddit is weirdly negative about Paris but I've been there loads of times  both for the touristy stuff and to just hang out and drink wine and eat delicious food  People there have never been anything but polite to me and I'm an English speaking Canadian  so don't let anyone tell you that you'll hate it   go see for yourself  Plus  France is such a beautiful country in general  so I recommend taking the train out to some other areas if you can swing it    Personally  I don't see the point in going to the US this year with so much great stuff happening in Canada for 2017  You can always save them for next year     Talking to people  not just girls  randomly is indeed weird unless there's something in common to talk about   Not if you do it right Should've taken the photo with the shower tiles in the background for the ultimate meta game Yeah that is really rough  I can't blame her for not trusting anyone anymore  even if you haven't done anything wrong being betrayed by your own sister is a real low  I'm so sorry mate  the only thing I can suggest is to just support her  and try and get her to see professional help because you can't help her with her problems  but someone with an education in it may be able to help  I wish you all the luck mateYou're welcome  and like I said  you can message me whenever you want   Aw  that's sad that people were so horrible to you for so long over something that isn't your fault   It's perfectly understandable that you would become bitter and cynical after that   I think you could combat that  if you surround yourself with nice people   You do not seem bitter beyond repair   You were nice to me and didn't tell me to get lost or anything like that  I'm more stable now  My sister spoke with me on the phone this morning and told me she was my best friend  but couldn't find me  so I have to go back home and see her today  My mother hasn't spoken to my dad in two days  so hopefully it'll stay that way This takes time   Barely a year and you are not better yet is no surprise  Mental health improvements are rarely fast  You are not wrong or bad or messed up because you are not better yet  you are completely normal   See if you can get in to an endocrinologist to check for hyperthyroidism  One of the side effects I get from it is excessive rumination   nonstop thinking about people who made me mad  Weird huh   But it turned off the minute I got on some meds  Other symptoms  irritability  anxiety  head sweating  hair thining   I also hope you can find a therapist who can help you work through your traumas  Medication is good but it needs to be taken with therapy so you can learn new ways of thinking that aren't harmful   I encourage you to try out meditation  as that is the skill of learning to control your focus of your thoughts  Any meditative practice will help you stop thinking about the bad thoughts if you don't want to  Look up mindfulness meditation  Buddhist teachings in general are great methods for finding relief in new ways of thinking    Please be kind to yourself and know if things aren't working right with therapy or meds or any care you're getting you can ask to try something else and they must respect you  You will have to be the one to advocate for your own care and make yourself better  even if you weren't the one to make you sick  We all in the same boat    but we can help each other   I am going to correct you with one comment here  Just because her husband has a specific fetish or is into a different type of "thing" it doesn't necessarily mean their sex life is suffering  Sometimes people just get bored with the norm and start to explore their curiosity  Maybe it is something she should talk about to him  ALSO  to OP you should not be sifting through your husbands personal things  Yeah I know the feeling you have  Honestly if you find the conversation drying up  I like to think of abstract and big picture questions that provoke the other person to think  One tip I heard is asking follow up questions using "what" and "why" to really expand and deepen the conversation as it continues  Also you'll find yourself more engaged and hopefully your friend will too as they answer a question they may not have thought of before  Personally  I like asking questions like "What do you think about    In the future " Or something like that where there is no one word answer and probably will open up possibilities for the conversation to grow into   Hope that helps  When I see goodlooking people I start to get very angry Then maybe he saved it just for fun  to show it to you or some friend for example  Best case scenario   Have you considered that   If not  I don't know  too sensitive for me  That's all that goes through my head This is a good explanation of things  She often cites my dad and I "abusing her" as a cause of her cruelty towards us  She considers our attempts to stop her drinking  not doing exactly what she wants  when she wants  and trying to get her to listen when we tell her how to change and how to fix herself "abuse "Oh correct  I just assumed the other party would ask questions too  even if it's the same question   It also helps to use a few emojis or exclamation points to show a little emotion  I actually prefer younger guys  I think most girls like older guys because they want someone to take care of them  I don't need that  I just want someone to have fun with How old are you OP Good that would benefit societyDo you really go to the circus freakshow to help the performers  If you're near a University  you could call yourself "The Library"  It doesn't  necessarily  mean anything   Not uncommon for good  straight males who aren't going to be anything but  to have transgender masturbation fantasies   But to actually go beyond  Unlikely   I wouldn't talk to him about it  Frankly  you shouldn't have snooped and again  it doesn't necessarily mean anything   Keep it as a data point and file it for future reference   That's it     If you can't do that  I would say that this is more of an issue to your relationship than concerns about his sexuality  and apparently you know that  So  good luck truly There are too few examples of when an protective type boots somebody out of their life  but my message essentially is  If they do not value you and grow "secure" in always having somebody to catch them no mater what bs they do or get into  then they need to grow up more  meaning horrible things must happen so they learn that integrity is not just a vanity item but survival  Your story broke my heart  I get it  I so       get it  Going through almost the same thing right now  I don't know what's worse the cheating or the mind games that cheaters play  15 years down the tube  He said she's good to him  What he means is she kisses his butt and does everything he wants    Please remember this  the other woman hasn't put up with his good  bad  and ugly  He hasn't shown his true side to her yet  I now believe once a cheater always a cheater  In my case it's also once an alcoholic always an alcoholic and a cheater and a manipulative jerk  We are better off without people that drain our good energy  I dont feel like reddit can help you to be honest  This is too deep  This is too serious  You need to talk to an adult about it   While looking for a house I did see some lots but they're about as expensive as what I'm qualified for    Unless you're clairvoyant  you don't know that it  will  never happen  But even accepting that it very well  might  not happen is no easy feat   Clairvoyance is not needed  just an understanding of the universal concepts that make one desirable  There is a reason why  in my 34 years of existence  no matter what I try    nobody   has wanted anything to do with me  My family hasn't wanted anything to do with me  I have never had a girlfriend  or even a male friend     By the way  from 18 28  I was certain I would  never  ever manage to get a single date  I hardly ever tried seriously  so no wonder   Well   I   tried hard  Many people on here try tried hard    And that's the  only  reason that they included the opt out option  It's not their fault if someone forgets to opt out  especially since it'll likely be done when applying for either licensing or some other government required registration If you feel like really doing it  or need a caring soul  call a hotline  Don't even question it  just call  If you can't call  get out among people even if it means wandering the aisles at the only Walmart open all night or sitting in a booth at the Awful Waffle at 2 a m    This sounds like suicidal ideation  rather than feeling actively suicidal  I went through many  many years of this feeling  I didn't want to kill myself  but suicide  death  and dying were very frequent  prominent thoughts  I'd also wondered  what it would be like to do random hurtful things  like put my hand under a running lawn mower or drive into a median   Do not do these things   Sometimes I'd indulge the thoughts  other times I'd be scared that I felt this way and just knew I was crazy  feared I really could do something terrible on impulse one day    lots of anxiety and what ifs  After getting trauma therapy and medication that worked properly for depression and anxiety  I realized I wasn't crazy  just not well and needed the right help  and had my own work to do   If you're able  please start seeing a counselor and be totally honest and open about everything  If cost is a deterrent  ask about counselors who do pro bono or sliding scale work  If that doesn't pan out  start sitting in at support groups for depression  anxiety  grief  OCD  trauma   anything that seems like a reasonable place to start   I strongly recommend this anyway   Tons of churches offer support groups if you can't find one that's close and not spiritual  Don't be put off by the religious aspect right off the bat if you're not into religion  because a lot that I've attended aren't pushy and  as with everything  you can take what works and leave the rest  If there's been substance trouble or abuse in your life or a close relationship  other good support resources to look at are Alanon and AA    I'm throwing a lot out here  but I'm thinking of addressing the reasons why you feel suicidal and off  That's the root cause you'll have to untangle and heal when you're ready  That's how it worked for me    How well trained are your legs Well that post had around 4000 upvotes and probably made it to the top of r all  so there were a few of them there   It might be the reason why there are so few of them here  There are a lot of posts here  but most of them never get more than 100 200 upvotes  unlike some other subs  And by hitting the front page more often  the subs become more famous and attract new people  I pay everything I buy with a credit card  I then pay the credit card off every month  It's a great way to build credit  If you aren't doing that I highly suggest it  Having a proven track record for using credit is huge You may be at the brink  They've always been doing it  You're just now noticing  In a bit of time you'll actually start to spit as you watch couples walk by Hey  I am also a sexual assault victim and I have self harming suicidal tendencies  I am so sorry about what happened to you  but it's okay to feel how you're feeling  Don't feel like you have to pretend to be someone you're not right now  and don't be afraid to open up to someone  Your friends  your family  the police  just anyone  You can get help  Therapy helps a lot  being able to talk to a trusted adult confidentially and getting real advice can be extremely helpful  It will get better  believe me  It might not be worth much just coming from a random Internet stranger  but I care about you and I hope you are okay  I know how terrible it is and I know about feeling worthless  depressed and alone  Don't be afraid to PM me if you need someone to talk to  or I can give you my email address  You are a wonderful person  you are stronger than you think and you do not deserve the pain and suffering that you are dealing with  I really hope that things get better for you and I'm here if you need me  Sending love  keep being brave xoxoI'm a software engineer coder and I actually go to coffee shops a lot to work  I enjoy the bustling atmosphere with lots of people  it makes me more productive  I also enjoy people watching while I'm thinking about how to solve problems  Also  people may not always just start talking to you but if you initiate conversation and are friendly  most people will be happy to talk  People like interaction naturally  and love talking about themselves if you give them the chance  Hell  I befriended a girl in a coffee shop and talked with her for like an hour after she tried to sit at a broken wobbly table after I'd seen like 3 other people try and I made a lame joke about it Have you talked to your therapist about this    They can address it directly  as developing trust is part of their toolset they learn  and not having trust is a symptom of many disorders  and a very common problem they help people fix   Dude just print this out and give this to your therapist  You cannot get through therapy if you can't be open about your feelings so you have to deal with this problem FIRST  And

school  or just trying to make conversation They come here from time to time  but not to help   They come here with a post along the lines of "I just broke up with my bf gf of five years   I'm FA now " r relationship advice is a much more productive sub  Sorry bud  It's too lateI think you have a point there  If I may ask  when you said you want someone to have fun with  did you mean as in something casual  Cause I've gotten the experience some older women will consider younger men for that but not for anything serious  How much younger do you go for I have this thing where I have to be the older party  I don't know where it comes from or why I have it  I'mean never interested in older women  Age is a deal breaker for me  I see  anything in particular you find attractive with younger people so inspiring tbhD'you think it's worth posting there too then  to get another outlook on it I try not to limit myself too much   My range is 18 to 45   The closer to 18  the better   I'm 39 I said "it could mean"  I did not say that their sex life is going down for sure  I said it could be because of that  Don t drink any thing except water  and not much of that    One of my voice students made the error of drinking milk before a interview  and she sounded like a 10 year old kid  Makes your lips and tongue stick together    Breath  but don t make it sound like a tornado going into your throat  If you get to pre read the material  use a pencil to put in pause points and underline the power words   Jim b  Talk to somebody you trust and or report him to the police I hadn't considered a physical letter  That's actually an excellent idea  I'll write one up and see how it looks  Thank you very much By a few years or do you feel you have to be a lot older than her Another thing that helped me was just getting enough sleep   I have a low dose of ambien for that   So the nights I can't calm down take it and its just enough to get me to sleep   I know it can get scary at times just know you aren't alone in it  I've heard this before  I once vacationed near an ocean  and I was too scared to get too far out because the waves were crashing and I had no idea how I'd get back to shore  I really want to try floating in the ocean one day Beans         we have  have a few    JiM b  You can just give her support  beyond that you can't do much else  She needs to get some courage and if she really wants to break up with him  just do it and be stern in her decision  Make sure after she does it  that you're available so she can come see you and you can comfort her  Thanks for the input It may be a regional issue  because in my country  when you turn 18  either party can open the adoption and get in connection with their parent pretty easily  If the parent reaches out  the child has the option to accept or decline  But I've never heard of anyone not able to get in contact  My aunt put a teenage pregnancy child up for adoption and was easily able to get in contact 18 years later despite the child having moved across the country For specifically these reasons there is opt out I hope assholes like you go to the bottom of the organ list  You don't want to give your organs when you die  then you don't get to receive other peoples organsYou body is not yours it's made of what you eat and what your mother ate when you where an infant  So in way you are only renting it Yes   At first I thought they were going "oh"  because it's not a big deal  since it's actually fucking normal  but then a few moments later "I brought X to take my virginity" and they started clapping     I will never get Clapistan and how they push this meme  If a hamplanet like her gets looked down upon  imagine someone that's normalish looking and how they'll react     It looks fake  but that's how memes get startedIANAD but as I understand it seems some psycho active medicines like mirtazapine can increase appetite and therefore weight  It works just like "normal" weight gain    you won't gain 20 pounds over night  it's a gradual process    One thing you might consider if you do decide to try mirtazapine is weighing yourself now and then in 2 4 weeks or right before your next appointment  If you do gain weight  keeping in mind that a person's weight can fluctuate up to 4 5 pounds in a single day from water alone   definitely talk to your doctor    Best of luck Thanks for your input  When you say to float and curl for warmth   what do you mean by curling  Honest question  I feel like I'm going through a similar thing too  I've accepted that my job is my job  I'm not sure about everyone else but I don't know if I'd enjoy work any more than I do now if I were doing something more creative  I've just tried to pursue other interests despite not loving my job    When you say you want to do something more creative do you just mean music  How about art  I just got into Dungeons and Dragons  and that led me into miniature painting  So far I like it but I do fear it might be short lived like you've said in your post  I think it's best to just do what you can and continue to discover new stuff until you find something you'll keep at for a while  There's nothing wrong with trying and not being able to stick to it  You really have to start somewhere  right  Let her know that she doesn't owe anyone a relationship and that she doesn't need to win some sort of court case to break up with someone  She doesn't need his consent  She just has to do it  Tell her to do it in a public place if that would make her feel better  Let her know you will go with her if she needs you to do that  Suggest that she completely cut him off from all social media as soon as she has broken up with him You can go into the sea until the water reaches your waist level for example and you are able to return safely  No big deal  Even a kid could do it   Unless the weather is very very bad  But if it is so  you will know it  You shall try it  the feeling of getting hit by a wave can't really be described by me    I think that for the most part  posters here want sympathy  not assistance   It's not like a normie has the ability to cast a love spell on your behalf   You can be friends when there's no longer a "him sized" hole left in your life   That is  when you've moved on and made a life without him    whether that means you've got another man  or not   The thing about long time couples  like married couples  is that they do become something of a group mind  one handles some things for the pair  the other handles other things   Nobody has to be good at everything  because the group mind itself handles that    and that includes not only skills  but things like the ability to ground each other  calm each other down  provide confidence  etc    Edit  And when one leaves or dies  the other is confused or bereft  because half of their "mind" has vanished  and they have to make up for it    Every couple starts in the group mind direction  but most of them don't make it  especially if both aren't committed to the same things   He had one vision of what your relationship should be  you had another  and you both liked each other enough that you stayed together even though you couldn't reach agreement   But without agreement these things will either come to a head  or you'll just drift apart   And frankly I think coming to a head is better than just letting the relationship rot away passively    Forgive him for not being what you wanted to think he was    he isn't     and not understanding why he ought to be   Forgive yourself for not going over in his direction    because maybe you shouldn't have  how much of yourself are you really supposed to give up   It will hurt  and you will move on  and it will take time   I don't think you should be friends because that would be confusing to your emotions   His willingness to bring up the "friend" thing so early is just a sign of him not being on the same page as you when it comes to what this relationship meant   This is definitely good advice as well  Tell her to follow this  Thank you for the tip  It's my goal to be able to swim a pool's length twice  It frustrates me that even children learn to swim in a more  seemingly  faster and fearless manner than me  I wish my parents knew how to swim or at least enrolled me in lessons  At this point  IRL I don't make my inability to swim public   so I'll probably have to find another swim teacher  Too much shame Great  About what is that  generally She got a new boi   she doesn't give a fuck about you  Just get away Just sharing my opinion  you have a problem with that  If so  you may want to leave reddit  I love my mom  But she is a bitch  I want to go as far s to buy a car tracker and see if she's really going to work  To be honest  if after four years  you're not ready to commit to your relationship  it's probably not a relationship  You have to decide to either take the risk and move there  if she can't move to you  or you probably should end the relationship  Most people in long distance relationships don't want to be long distance but it sounds like you have no issue with that  which isn't the best sign    It's about compromise  Move there for a bit and see how it goes and perhaps after she's finished her education  see if you can move somewhere more suitable  Honestly  I think you're best bet is listening to  u basicczechgirl  You messed up  it happens to everyone  Make sure it doesn't happen again by not drinking so much  eating a meal before drinking  and staying hydrated with water  Then do something to make up for it  Make sure you straight up apologize as well I don't think you have a lasting relationship   Modern tech lets you live apart and still relate to each other    while keeping the important life decisions on the back burner     But you can't keep them there forever  if neither of you is willing to compromise their life preferences  you have to break it off or at least dial it down to non exclusive  The best thing to do would to leave it up to your parents to sort it out  Maybe there is a reason why your dad is thinking and reacting the way he is  a reason you might not know of  You could also talk to your dad privately and explain to him that you disagree with his actions and that he should talk to your mom about the matter instead of fighting and making the situation worse  Hearing it from you might make him realise that the way he is going about this is influencing you in a negative way  making you stressed and worried  Good luck and I hope this flies by  What sort of things could I do to make up for it  I've bought a card that I'll send to her  but they say that gifts aren't a good idea  Should I treat her to a meal or something  She usually never lets me pay for anything hahaHey  I'm sorry about your friend  He sounds pretty stupid I have no doubt saying that he will get a rude awakening one day  when he has to fend for himself and live in the real world  If you don't think he's a good friend to you  just stop being friends with him  because you can't be happy in a toxic friendship  You sound like a pretty cool guy and you should have other friends  Just spend time with the people that you really like  and don't waste time on spoilt  unappreciative people  Luckily  not everyone here in the UK is like that  PM me if you need someone to vent to   While I'm not usually a fan of white knighting I'm going to urge you to to speak up and especially make the men in your family aware   Guys        tend to pick up on other guys acting creepy  faster than  girls do      What this guy did was calculated and brazen   This guy knowingly placed you into a he said she said   You need to assume that he is doing it to other girls in your family    How will your family feel if he's outed by  someone else and you were silent        Instead of being afraid use your family for courage  your sincerity will shine through   But above all live your life for yourself   Anyone that chooses that scum over you isn't worth worrying over Thank you very much      The weight gain from these things is from a change in appetite  WE DON'T KNOW WHY SOME SSRIs CAUSE WEIGHT GAIN  YOU ARE WRONG   For example  weight gain from anti depressants might be because of changed carbohydrate metabolic pathways  https   www ncbi nlm nih gov pubmed 23855649  Or changes in the gut microbiome   here's an easy read Quora answer  https   www quora com How do SSRIs affect the microbiome  You've just told people who have little control over the weight gain  and who have  mental ill health  that their failings are entirely their own fault I have no idea what happens  I hate routine work and And I despise doing the same thing over and over again  I need constant change or stimulation to be interested or else I just don't care  Maybe because I think its a really easy project to do if I were to truly put the effort in and then I just half ass it all the way  No matter how insane of a task it is or how interesting it is I WILL LOOSE INTEREST  It just gets boring af  I have tried everything  I feel like this is holding me back from finding my true passion Mind  Blown    maybe literally  someday No problem   If you don t mind       what sort of training have you had in the past     And what type of work are you trying to get    Jim B  Credit karma says I'm at 765 It's high demand all over really  I'm in northern California where prices are pretty much high everywhere I thinkI got through high school by being likeable by older adults  and proving I knew the material perfectly  not so much by going to class  Towards the end  I couldn't even manage half the homework with all that was going on at home   I imagine that finding a job I did well enough to be profitable compared to other potential employees would be nigh unto impossible  Things I do well generally still take me longer than most  and interacting with others always eventually results in a problem  My non written communication skills are as uneven as everything else  too good at vocabulary but I can't keep pace and use facial expressions  tone  or body language  Eventually  either I think someone's angry or mean or someone thinks I'm rude not paying attention etc   I'm just not worth it in terms of profitability  even with more education  I was trying the MOOCS last year  but then I had to find new places to stay like 6 times  and I'm still unsure if this place will last long enough to move my stuff in or get internet  Even so  there isn't much chance of me ever being able to handle too much more  It only takes a car alarm going off or similar sudden loudish noise to render me nearly useless for a day  and while our medical understanding of sensory differences is still very new  so far it seems sensory issues generally need to be addressed in very young children for any benefit and tend to worsen with age Stop drinking and going out  Find another form of entertainment  alcohol isn't the only fun thing in life you know You're right  it's not my problem anymore  It's been hard to separate myself from it since  for a long time after we split  I was still the only person who knew the full extent and thus was the person she talked to about it  But that doesn't happen anymore and you're right  Maybe it wouldn't be a bad idea to develop some quiet hobbies to ingrain some sort of peace Well   split family  fights and change of school doesn't help you to get better  Even that can make you feel worst   Everyone and especially people with mental health issues need stability   Anyway   try to go back to therapy and try to make at least one  most trusted person in the family   know how you honestly feel about everything     About your situation pretdending   well it's heavy to say  maybe you just miss social life  your friends from old school and brothers   maybe is just usual day dreaming   maybe something else    professional therapist should know better    but still   that fact that you've been diagnosed with so many different diagnoses shows that even professionals can be wrong   Hope you get well  I don't know the ins and outs of your relationship  so it's easy for me to say this from a 3rd person point of view  From an outside point of view  3 years together is not some ungodly amount of time  It is a lot of time when you're 21  but it's not a huge amount of time in the grand scheme of things  Don't think of it like you "wasted" these years with him  You learned a lot about yourself  what you value in a partner and relationship  and what you will and will not put up with  Maybe you would be willing to put up with this and try to get him the help he needs  My personal view though is that somewhere along the line he got severely damaged  Maybe he had a rough upbringing  had a traumatic event  or something that triggered him to have a lust for such a horrible fetish   Some people withhold judgement  Some say that if he's not actively out there feasting on children then it's harmless to let him indulge in his desires so long as he doesn't actually do anything to kids  Not me  I can put up with a lot and consider myself to be more patient than just about everyone else I've met  But this is not something I would tolerate for a second   You're 21  You don't need someone with this kind of baggage in your life  Yeah  you could talk to him and he could explain himself  Maybe he says it's just a fantasy and nothing he would ever act on   Maybe he admits that it's wrong and he wants help but is scared to seek it out  But in that case  is that something you want to deal with  As you said  you can't even look at him without wanting to throw up  Maybe he even addresses it  Maybe he sees a therapist  works through his issues  and all is better  But then 20 years down the road when you're married and have a couple of kids together and a house out in the suburbs  all of a sudden he gets arrested for molesting a child  Or he goes back to downloading images off the internet and gets caught   The most difficult thing about this is that there is no certain path forward  You can certainly talk to him about it and hear his side out  Even if he gets help and gets "over" this  you're going to consistently wonder if he's still attracted to kids or if he would act on anything there  And God forbid if he actually DOES do anything more than just look at pictures   It's hard to throw 3 years away like that  If you were married to the guy for 10  years  I might give you some different advice about hearing him out and trying to work through it  But you've only invested 3 years into this guy  I know that truly is a lot of time  but in the grand scheme of things you have lots of time to get over him  move on  and find someone else while you're still young  It does make it difficult that he helped you while you battled depression and meth addiction  Some would say  how is his addiction any different than what he helped you with  But in spite of that  there are resources out there and there are clear pathways to help for those addictions  Meth and depression are two types of addictions with a very strong physical component to them that can be overcome  The child porn fetish is something rooted mentally within him that is not something you can easily treat by going cold turkey or taking some Prozac   You're only 21  You're still drafting in the first round right now when it comes to available people  You can meet an attractive  intelligent  good hearted guy still and have a long and happy life  By all means  talk to him first and see what he has to say for himself  Ultimately it's your choice if you want to stand by him and try to get him some help  but from an outside point of view I would strongly recommend breaking away from this guy So your partner is clearly mentally ill  but in my eyes as long as he hasn't actually abused any children  he isn't unrecoverable  This might  and I guess probably will  put an end to your relationship  but I believe putting him in prison will turn him from a pedophile into a child molestor  which is what prison does  makes things worse   What this guy needs is professional help to control his illness' urges and overcome the clear problems he has  You should definitely touch base with an older adult that isn't going to act based on emotions  but logic  An emotional response to this is going to end badly  because that's what emotional reactions result it  bad decisions that feel right but make little logical sense  If he refuses help multiple times  you should push him multiple times to get help and threaten legal action if he refuses  then the only solution is legal action  However  I must stress that it is in a way  your responsibility to ensure he has the opportunity to get professional help and make sure this doesn't lead to anything more  although it is NOT your responsibility to make sure he takes said opportunity   If you need any clarifications or if I was unclear in my comment  please PM me and I'll help you the best I can  I'm no expert  but I do want to help both you and your partner and make sure there are no victims in this situation Not really  that can help you but most of the time it is weird I suppose I could rid myself of the bitterness  but it would take a while I mean I've seen normies on here with faux "I want to help" lines  but really it's obvious they're trying to trigger people There are too many complications within the story to summarize into

to start a conversation with random people in streets won't be an easy task and most of the time people aren't really interested  It is easier if there's a common place interest that you share I think you should also promise her  and obviously keep your promise  that you're not drinking again     I know that if I was her  and you had even one drink  I'd be dreading the possibility that this might happen again  I think this single incident was so severe and upsetting that it alone justifies cutting out alcohol altogether    Maybe in the future  way in the future  you could revisit social drinking again with her  but at least for now you should not touch a drop  Hi  first please accept my apology for my late response  It seems to be a somewhat chronic issue of mine  All I can say is that I have been knee deep in family drama for too long    I think that is a fantastic idea  I generally prefer the "DYI sink or swim on your own merits" method as it seems to suit me more  I'll look into the ted talks  Thank you  If your friend has any interest in allowing a complete stranger to pick her brain about the whole process  please let me know  Haha   Thanks for your advice Ok  that's just ridiculous  Tennis elbow I can empathize with but selfies   pDealing with Envy is dealing with reality  You might not be where you want to be in life  or you might feel like you deserve what they

work to make sure what you have is something you can be proud of  What you're saying may not be wrong  These people have it better than me  these people don't have to go through as much shit as me  I want friends like them  It's normal to want more  and it's normal to pout about it  Just don't linger on it and let it define how your life is run  Be jealous  be mad  just make sure that being jealous and mad makes you work to something you want versus defeating the purpose of trying to get what you want    Sorry if this advice wasn't that great  I just thought something was better that nothing  Best of luck out there  I've never heard of toastmasters  I am looking into it now  Thank you so much   P S  I'm so sorry for responding late  I have had a lot of family drama and lack of internet connection   Want my honest opinion  He's not producing  distributing  or physically taking action to "further his needs" he's only viewing non nude pre teens  which actually ain't illegal  I'd say leave him me  Kick his ass to the curb if you wish but there's no reason to escalate the situation where everyone will know  It's not CP unless they're clearly naked     Edit  I'm an idiot  Never read it throughly obviously there were naked pictures     Try and convince him to get mental help  If you think for even a second that hes taking his "needs" further and is trying to physically hook up with children or talking to them online then call the cops  Better yet  sit him down to talk about it  He'll deny it at first and get irritated but don't get mad  act calm  Once he opens up find out all the details  Is it just a look and stroke the sausage type thing  or is  talking to children or trying to do things with them  Take it from there  As much as I don't think it's normal  I also don't agree with locking up someone in the same cell as a murder just because he was viewing images  Say what you want  let you closed minded fingers press the downvote button  That's my r unpopularopinion  I may have misspoken when I said "fun" like I'm talking about someone to hang out with and do things with  I wasn't talking about sexual "fun" like sleeping with a different guy every night    Sorry  I don't have a lot of experience with dating  I like 25 28  I guess I'd also consider someone my age and older too  I'm pretty lonely relationship wise so I guess I shouldn't be too picky     Thank you  I am looking into it  I've never heard of it before Ask them to go to an event with you or do an activity with you  Then you can have that connection in person with them In addition to this  sounds a little bit like gaslighting too Thank you for all the information Any history of trauma Ever try being silly and after the dance  bow and kiss their hand and say "m'lady"   Edit  Sorry  this probably wouldn't work on "normal" girls  just weird ones like myself I don't do "fault"   Ever    I'm perfectly happy if you were to believe everyone's weight problems are entirely my fault    It makes no difference to me   This is simply something I have done  that works for me   It may work for the OP who is concerned about weight gain  it may not   There is no downside to knowing how many calories you are eating Small but important distinction  OPs habit of binging and then purging by fasting is more characteristic of bulimia than anorexia  Dang  that is a pretty tough spot  Have you talked with any Realtors that specialize in cheaper homes  I don't know the area well  but that might be your best bet other than moving away  which probably isn't what you want I think you need to look introspectively here  You are angry at your "friend"  who you never met  because she didn't go on a date with you and because she got a boyfriend  She's not really at fault here  you are  You aren't and probably were never really her friend because the purpose was always to date her  You being upset at her for going out with someone else is actually kind of weird because it sort of implies that you had dibs on her despite never meeting her    For both your sake  you should probably stop talking to her  It might be best to tell them you can't help them out financially anymore  If it's too awkward you can just say money is tight right now    Only let them use your washing machine if you feel comfortable  Does 5 USD mean dollars  If so it's possible it was misplaced but they might have taken it  If you don't feel comfortable having them in your home please don't feel obligated I've no idea why people in this thread are telling you to ask people you know for advice  This is an open and shut case        I study psychology  Pedophilia is an orientation and currently incurable  At most  he could work with a psychologist and take a medication to curb his libido  It helps that he seems to have an attraction to adults  in addition to children  Unless he is using you as a cover  which is possible  In the case that he's attracted to both  it's easier for him to fight against his lust for children  Will he though  Who knows  Child porn is not a victimless crime  Love is not something that overcomes all  I think that you should tell the police and break up with him  If not  confront him  and order him to see a psychologist  right away        I think that you'd be very selfish if you let this go  and ignore it  You'd be placing your relationship before the safety of children  Your relationship is unimportant compared to preserving the innocence of children You decide for yourself  You don't have to if you don't want to   Please listen to this This American Life  episode  https   m thisamericanlife org radio archives episode 522 tarred and feathered act 2 act 2  on the topic of pedophiles    This opened my eyes and made me see those afflicted with it as deserving of some compassion   That being said  those photos  in a lot of cases  are putting a child at risk  The child is the important one for your SO to consider  It's not a victimless crime just because your SO only looks I have no preferences with most races  but I just have an aversion to facial hair no matter the skin color  And now beards seem to be all the rage    Tough growing up with many traumatic happenings  That could lead to "closing in"   empathy loss  when painful happenings occur again  That's probably a good idea  but what confuses me is that I've been very drunk many times before to the point of feeling ill and throwing up  and not once have I shown any signs of aggression  That's why it's so scary because it's like I wasn't myself I work at a property management company full of Realtors hahaDang  then you'd know all about where to look and what's available      that sucks  and I wish I could offer more help  but it doesn't sound like you have a lot of options  How many doctors have you been to  When their medication didn't work or do anything  did you follow up with them afterwards   For this to flare up and be so severe that it puts you out of commission for 10 days several times  3 4   throughout the year  that's a serious issue  I assume it also has a constant baseline of discomfort outside of flare ups that make the time in between also uncomfortable   My wife has a thin stomach lining  so maybe 2 3 times per year she has a really strong pain burn for a few hours  but then it's over  If it was so bad that she was out for weeks at a time  that's something you've got to relentlessly pursue with doctors    When my best friend was 17  he got these really bad heart palpitations  The thing is though  the doctors didn't see anything that was wrong  They would run some tests  but everything looked fine  He didn't have trouble unless he was doing something strenuous  like playing basketball with us   When that happened  his heart would race almost 200 beats per minute  at 220 you have heart failure    He saw 10  different doctors  none of which found anything  They would tell him it was probably nothing since their tests didn't find anything  and they would say to come back if it happened again  Well  it would happen again and when he went back  they still couldn't find anything so again they would shrug it off  Exasperated  he turned to natural remedies  but of course that didn't cure it either  Finally  after the several doctors he saw  he saw a new one and explained what was happening  This was when he was 23 or 24  He explained it   the doctor ran some tests  then came back and confirmed that his heart was beating out of sync  3 of the 4 chambers would beat at once  but 1 chamber beat at a different time than the rest  They need to beat at the same time to properly push your blood and distribute oxygen  so only having 3 4 of the power is what caused his body so much stress  After running that test and diagnosing him  a week later they had him in the OR for open heart surgery  They fixed the issue and now 7 years later he's still all better  But  he had that issue for 6  years before he finally found a doctor who could help him   I know it feels hopeless right now and like it's something that you just have to live with  but that seems like such a serious issue if you can't work for over a month every year  when you add the time up   There's got to be some underlying issue that they can treat   Outside of all of that  in the meantime you need to get a job  right  So find a job  don't mention this issue  then when it pops up  go to your doctor and get a report from them detailing your medical issue and that you might need intermittent time away from work for 5 10 days at a time  or whatever the doctor will agree to   Explain to your employer at that time that you were diagnosed with this debilitating Gastritis and see if they can accommodate you for this   If you work at a job for a year or more  then you are entitled to FMLA leave and a protected under that act  The employer needs to have at least 50 employees  and you must have worked there for 1 year and worked at least 1 250 hours in that previous year in order to be eligible  If you are eligible  then you get up to 12 weeks of unpaid time off per year for any qualified medical conditions  At that time  get the doctor to fill out your FMLA paperwork and then you'll be set  No employer is going to fight this once you're protected  The issue is making it 1 year at a company  That's where if you talk to them when it comes up  then they should hopefully be more sympathetic  By that time  hopefully you've demonstrated that you're a good employee and do good work  If that's the case  they could accommodate these one off situations until you're eligible for FMLA  I work in HR and I'm sure my company would be accommodating of something like this if the employee is a good employee Thank you  Unluckly  he likes people of the opposite gender of mineThat sucks  man  I'm sorry you're feeling so rough right now    The only thing I can think of is to say that exercise is good for relieving tension  Go for a jog workout if you can      Also  have you visited  r wholesomememes  I love that place  ' Seriously  you need help  You're so desperate for attention  You make new accounts and post everyday despite getting advice  Your looks are not the issue  it's your desperation and personality perhaps  Again  YOU'VE BEEN TOLD  go to a psychiatrist ASAP    EDIT  This guy is a troll    https   imgur com a nULwMMy looks are an issue because I get told I'm uglyI'm an entrepreneur and I need polite small talk not to scare people off  I need to collect info about them to reuse some of their concept in my pitch  I'm not looking for a real connection on my part   but I don't need to tell them this      In my country there's still stigma for women who don't bear children  I don't want to discuss feminism with this people  I need to be kind and appropriate Oh I should have been more specific   I meant moving back to the city where I grew up where my family still resides   I wouldn't be living with them   I would be living on my own and fully financially supporting the child   I just meant I would need some emotional support and help with childcare once in a while   PLEASE Dude  unless you yourself are paying attention to ugly girls  you're being a massive hypocrite because you expect girls to do things that you yourself won't do   Your standards and expectations are unrealistic   You'll have success with girls if you go after girls who are in your league   Think about it from the girl's perspective  if you were a 10 10 girl  would you go after a 5 10 guy     I've seen your posted pictures are you really aren't ugly   Not a hottie but definitely average   Which means it's your personality and body language turning them off   You come across as extremely desperate even on the internet  so I can only imagine how needy and desperate you seem IRL   Your neediness and desperation are symptoms of an underlying problem  and you   need   to get some kind of mental health resources     Whether it's a support group  a private counselor  whatever  you need to talk to a professional   Unless you get help for your underlying problems  you won't find success with woman   Girls can tell when a guy is unstable and we tend to avoid men like that because we've all heard how dangerous it can be to date an unstable guy   Needy  desperate  average looking girls don't have success with handsome men either Maybe point out the things you love the most Wow   When all else fails defame the character of your opposition   Yeah im outta here Leave  Now   This is abuse I know the core thoughts made sense but the ideas weren't connected  Looking back  it's like reading a plot summary of Robocop  LoTR  and Shrek  one paragraph each I'm glad someone is there to love the snorers  If I had my way they'd be segregated and left to sleep with each other No  Listen to me now  The only advice you need is to go to a psychiatrist  Okay   If you think posting constantly on  r advice and  r amiugly will change anything  it won't unless you listen  Stop posting on here  Seek medical help  Up your confidence and move on  If you have things to say over text  it's fine  If you're not seeing them often  you can ask what they're up to and such  What's new  what's happening with whatever hobby they're into  what's up with your hobbies that you're doing I don't live with my parents so I have no clue  No one ever says anything  so I guess they assume I must be happy So tell them that too  All relationships are built upon communication  Whether it's a family relationship  romantic relationship  or a friendship   all are built on communication  If they're not communicating with you  then you tell them how that makes you feel   You don't know what the reason is  right  You don't know if they're mad at you  You don't know if they are sad about something  maybe a family member passed away and they are really broken up about it   You don't know if something traumatic happened  in a car accident and now they're paralyzed from the waist down and haven't come to grips with it yet   Or they could just be ignoring you   You tell them you're concerned about them and follow up with them  If they don't respond  then you tell them that it hurts your feelings to be ignored like this  If you did something that hurt them or bothered them  please let you know so that you can do something to address it and fix things  If you're just being too persistent or checking in too often  let's hear that too  Either way  you need to know if there's something you can do better or differently  At the same time  you have something for them to do better  or differently  and that's to communicate  If you're texting too much  then they should just say that  But just ignoring you is rude So are you only going after white girls  That chart doesn't say much though I mean I prefer pizza over hamburger any day of the week  but if someone offers me a burger I sure as hell won't say no  If you love him  turn the phone to the police right now  next time he's asleep  If you love him  make sure he can't hurt children anymore   And don't let him know that you found his child porn  or he will delete it  And possibly hurt you   He has no qualms abusing children  what makes you believe that he will respect an adult enough to not harm her  Please listen to what everyone is saying  You've been told this before  Get help for your mental issues and then work on the rest    12 13 year olds completely nude selfies  That's child porn  Maybe wait a bit and try too develop those feelings  And if you never do  break up with her      Well  at least you have a really good friend to love omfg the irony    Girl is ugly what does she do  Wears tons of makeup and then has that "I'm gods gift to men" attitude  a guys ugly  me  and they're shoved aside like a pice of shit  A girl can be ugly but get guys that like her a lot  but a guy needs to be the perfect 6 3" hunky sex god no less  What's your relationships with this person  How often do you have to see them   It sounds like no answer will please this person It's possible but I haven't been examined by a professional  Maybe I'm just extremely lazy  This is what makes it pretty much impossible for me to practice but not what makes it so i can't play songs   If I read a tab and learn how a song is supposed to be played I still don't have nearly enough skill to play it  Of course you have to practice a song before being able to play it but playing songs is so far beyond what I can do so it seems to early to practice that way   It seems like the only thing I can do is simple exercises over and over No  Child pornography is not a victimless crime  it is illegal for a good reason  Pedophilia should be addressed with therapy as soon as those interests arise  it is a very slippery slope from purchasing photos to pursuing live images to engaging children in inappropriate acts   Source  I'm not a therapist but my study is in abnormal psychology   Get help if you feel drawn towards children in a sexual way  please  Yeah I figured maybe that's what you meant but wasn't sure  What do you think it is about younger men that you prefer  I relate a lot to your last sentence as I stated in the OP also  It's not a date  just hanging out  Don't be nervous and talk to her like you would to any of your friends  If things go well and you have a great time then in future you could ask her out on a proper date  Have fun Obviously not  because I'm not the most attractive guy  I'm pretty short and yet I've rarely been single and I'm happily engaged  It's not your looks  it's your mental state  Why do girls always say "oh I care about personality more than looks"  which is absolute bs  because the guy who's personality is fantastic will always be second best to another guy who's a few points better looking  Lots of good advice here  just want to make a quick point  I understand that you love him but if you stay with him and your relationship progresses and you have children with him  will you ever be able to trust him    I suggest that you tell him to go to his doctor and ask for help  They will alert the authorities and give him the support he needs and he will be helped as he turned himself in  If he doesn't do this you really don't have any choice but to go to the police  Being a pedophile and having these attractions to young children is one thing  actually looking for and storing child pornography is a step further towards actual child abuse  the kindest thing for everyone including him  is to stop this now and let the police handle it    I am so sorry as it's a horrible thing to deal with but it's not petty shop lifting or something trivial you might be able to turn a blind eye to  this is really really serious  Good luck  XXYou've rarely been single because your probably manly and at least decent looking  if I was girl all I would have to do is put makeup on and I'd be hot just like that A met a friend of a friend at New Year's  She's 12 years younger than me and absolutely the most gorgeous woman I've ever seen in person   She's in a relationship already and would probably not ever want one with me  But I would certainly go past the socially acceptable age gap line for someone like her I've been an actress  mostly stage  for 5 years now after doing a drama school  and I also took a lot of singing classes  but it'll be the first time I'm auditioning for voice over  I'm a bit stressed because it'll be the first time I'll be acting on a microphone    The part they want me to audition is for a little boy  a little girl  and a bunch of animals  for a cartoon   so I'll have to modify my voice a lot  but they'll not give me the script before the audition  so I'll have to come up with a lot of different propositions  and different voices for characters I don't know yet  i'm searching right now to come with at least 5  different voices I can work on   Some people told me you have to somehow "overact" for cartoons characters and smile a lot while talking  but really this is all very new to me  They pretty much give me platitudes and then ignore everything else about me I didn't realize how many people actually sympathize with viewers of child pornography  Shame on you all   Report this to the police immediately  They may be able to track down the source of the images and rescue a child from exploitation and worse  Really strange motivation  like there's some underlying subconscious pull to avoid inflation in the dating marketEither you're a troll  or you need help with your mental state  Simple as that That made me feel all mushi inside  Thanks I think you're are assuming someone without confidence never tries     If they both try and 1 has some success while the other does not  guy with more success will have more confidence all other things being equal  There are entire websites dedicated to that pairing  if you're interested  I've actually seen plenty of Asian man Black woman couples in real life and online  there are quite a few YouTube couples  You're framing this situation like you either have to be sarcastic  or be quiet  Is it really so hard to be a genuine person that you would rather not say anything at all Congratulations on reaching adulthood  That soul sucking feeling of working for money at some place you just don't want to be is just about right   But  you can find ways to make it suck less  Some are mental tricks of having a hobby  volunteering  or a passion outside of work that's a driving force to keep you working  Another way is to think outside of the box when it comes to jobs  Like actual tattoo parlors  art galleries  student assistant positions  screen printing shop  etc  Your job experience doesn't have to fit into the same experience as everyone else's  Do some footwork and talk to people  Make the phone calls and get face to face to make it happen The Liberals' definition of "legitimate help"  includes the Murder of millions of babies each year among other things    See how that works Uhm  Mind to share what that would be  Hair on the back  Mole on the nose  Some things can be fixed  Some can't   Nothing wrong with finding a good teacher to help  It's well worth the time and money  And you'd be surprised how much it takes to get a lot of kids to swim  My main advice is keep going at it  don't give up Hi  I have updated the post with a small edit if this helps you to understand the situation even a little more clearly  Thank you for your input I'm probably uglier and shorter than you dude  but I don't act desperate and my mental state is stable  I have the confidence to know how to act in situations and I'm now happily engaged  You can do the same but you need    NEED to work on the underlying factor which is your mental issues I'm pretty sure those thoughts will stay as thoughts as long as you know it's wrong  As for standing up  you just have to do it  There's no other way to put it  Fight for what you want and for what you believe in If you don't make it weird  it's not going to be weird   omfg the irony    Girl is ugly what does she do  Wears tons of makeup  No   That's not how this works   Makeup can only do so much   Makeup can't hide a fat stomach   Makeup can't hide a terrible  needy  desperate  unstable  scary persona   When do you ever see a "perfect 6 3" hunky sex god" hooking up with an unattractive woman in makeup     and then has that "I'm gods gift to men" attitude  Just because she won't fuck you specifically doesn't mean she's arrogant or thinks she's God's gift to men   You come across as extremely entitled    a guys ugly  me  and they're shoved aside like a pice of shit   For the last time  YOU ARE NOT PHYSICALLY UGLY   You know why you get "shoved aside like a piece of shit "  Because you ACT like a piece of shit   Actually I wouldn't be surprised if girls are  scared  of you because you come on way too strong and desperate and they don't want to be the next domestic violence statistic   You need serious mental help   You won't do any better with girls until your personality improves  and your personality won't improve until you get treatment for your messed up issues That's how I feel   I've read about this phenomenon on my IPHONE the other day I agree that you should go out  but maybe not to coffee  Try something less romantic Your not uglier because of the position your in  rarely been single  probably at worst treated like a person by girls  Ok  Here's a question  if I done myself up for a night out and had confidence to burn would I get girls like you do or other guys do  You don't need me to answer that the guy who's personality is fantastic will always be second best to another guy who's a few points better looking    How did you come to this conclusion   Certainly not personal experience  because your personality is clearly terrible  toxic  perhaps even scary   Get mental help Just older  By weeks  months  whatever  As long as they're between my age and legal I'm not fussy You're actually pretty lucky that you can already think of relevant questions to ask   Now it's just a matter of faking it until you make it   Yes  it feels fake   Yes  it  is  fake   But that's okay   Just have to force yourself I think I misunderstood your proposal  I interpreted as they were still introducing a third person into the dynamic  which is just the epitome of playing with fire and has about a 0 3  success rate and given his abhorrence towards his own kink and desire to be rid of it  probably a 20 30  chance of him harboring homicidal thoughts towards the bull If you got your mental health issues taken care of  didn't care about looks as much as you do and genuinely tried to be interested in a girl instead of worrying about your friends and didn't act creepy  you'd probably be fine  But everyone has told you  you will be a lost cause until you take care of your health  I guarantee that is your main issue  It just sucks that I'm working 50 70 hoe a week making ok money and can't buy a house  I'm kinda mad at the system and that the house market is so expensive This post has been marked as  No Advice Wanted  NAW   https   redd it 21w712    Advice is subject to removal   Please report unwanted advice as

 Thanks  just didn't know if it was customary thing or notThis place has a really bad reputation  There's a reason I post here on my 2nd account and not my main one   People look at this board the same way they look at Incel and RedPill  While I don't think it's as bad here as it is in those places  I do think a lot of the posters in this sub aren't very accepting You're very kind  thank you okay thanks m  i was hoping i could avoid that but it looks like i might just have to suck it upI've waited for about 3 months now  she really loves me for some reason but I'm not sure I do yet You have a better than average background  and stage voice projection is one step away from being a voice actor    Being a kid   in a production   is clearly a challenge for many adults  who have a hard time with being silly and childish     Cartoon work is overacting   but in a good way  One thing to think about is trying to make the different characters  have a individual style of voice  A large animal may need to have a BIG voice   while a pussy cat needs to be a little tiny voice    Accents may also come into play     A Russian wolf may require a suitable accent to go with the lines  I do a great British butler  a Scottish sea captain and  a cockney taxi driver  as well as a Chinese piano teacher   I say  put a smile in your voice  and get the job    Jim B  Haha Jesus Christ your so delusional  Have you seen the difference an ugly girl can make with makeup and a dress  They have super high standards   Iv worked in a bar for 4 years I should know    Secondly a lot of girls do think they're gods gift  funnily enough it's always the less attractive ones all done up for the night  I'm entitled yes  entitled to be looked at as a person  not looked down on beciase of my looks by girls who say "I don't care about looks it's personality"    For example  at work in bar restaraunt I serve a group of women girls and be polite and courteous etc  obviously just doing my job as I'm told to be like that  and more often than you'd think they never say thanks when I go out of my way to help them  don't expect a thanks but besides the point  abut the good looking guys I work with serve them and they're completely different  despite the fact I was more helpful    There a tons of different types of girls who guys like  but there is only one perfect man    Stop twisting my words you little skank Thanks so much  This is proof that medication does more harm than good Report itYes  you have to report this to the police  Yes  you have to cooperate in the investigation    People seem to forget that within that scope of romantic love there are deal breakers  I am not sure why you feel that you have to enable him  and victimize innocents  just because you love him  You're being betrayed and hurt and put in danger by his decision to pursue illegal images  It would seem that the emotional balance is not equal anyways  Maybe you should talk to him and not post this online  There may be something you don't know  the ages might not be as low as you think  And the definition of porn is more than bikinis it's clear there is more from your post but the ages from those ones aren't clear  I'd never defend child porn or dirty pictures of kids but it's best if you speak to him first in my honest opinion Are you sure  What country Seriously  My mom and her husband can't even share a bedroom  She still looses sleep  I'm so very happy my man doesn't snore Dude  You have serious issues  This is why you'll always be single  You just are rude and shitty towards people  GET HELP  Until then  you don't deserve the advice that people are giving you  Not to mention a bar is a rather terrible place to get women  You have such unrealistic expectations  it's stupid  What is the point in personality when I'm ugly   Yes I'm ugly girls call me it  once upon a time ago I had a nice personality and was called "a lovely guy"  believe that or not  but after so long of trying but only to be what Iv said people are with me  In all honesty it's been no different to when I was nice to when I don't bother anymore You're showing some good judgement about your infatuation  Your fantasy makes you happy  but that fantasy is not the actual person  It's not her that's making you happy  it's the fantasy that your own mind made that's making you happy  You never even met her  it's one sided  You're using the thought of her to get some escape from being down   You might as well fantasize about me  a random comment on Reddit  That would be silly  right With good reason too  There are a lot of places like that though where people work multiple jobs and can't make ends meet  It's one of the reasons I moved out to a podunk town from the big city  I'd love to move back someday  but right now we're still making it by  we have a house  and food  but we're not able to save as much as we'd like    It's probably good to get your frustrations off your chest though  as letting things out is generally seen as a healthy option The context of work makes things a bit different  My apologies  I do still feel a small connection  however subtle  may help you out on this matter  It doesn't always have to be experiential  but can also be an emotional commonality  Finding the common ground can still be subtle  and gain you some respect as to the life you lead and your passion in the career path you've chosen  It could definitely change some things  I'm not so sure anyone really enjoys impersonal conversation  I don't know if I've helped out in any way  but I hope it's given you some food for thought on the matter  Good luck    You don't need to kill to be safe  Not having kids for one  I know that really hurts me dating wise but I don't have the baby rabies   Being more independent  I don't need or want to spend every minute with a SO  I need some alone time or to hang out with my friends and I assume he'd want time to hang out with his guy friends    Someone into more nerdy geeky things like comic books  anime  manga  board games  of course  and video games  Someone who doesn't think it's weird I want to carry around a d20 and roll to see if I get the Doritos at the grocery store   Someone also into fun stuff like go kart racing  roller coasters  zoos  etc  I guess it's more about being younger and wanting to have fun sometimes than being serious all the time   As long as the guy has a source of  legal  income to support himself  I don't need anyone wealthy  That's what I don't get about these girls on dating sites    why does the guy have to make  50k or more  To buy you crap    Sorry this is turning into a rant  Bottom line  just want someone low maintenance Your telling me that firm behind a screen  You know what  Fuck off  Your delusional like the other sket posting telling me girls don't have double standards Thank you so much for all you precious advice and your kindness Jim   I'll let you know if I get the part   It's not your fault  Please visit  r rapeThere is difference bietween an advice and a lecture Your personality is ugly  your looks are not  You're so fucking backwards in your head  Stop worrying about girls or your looks  Worry about your mental health  because it's the ugliest thing about you "That Cool Cafe"CALL THE POLICE  I don't understand the 'talk to a trusted adult' advice what so ever  This really needs to be reported to the police immediately  and you are not qualified nor are you equipped to deal with this  but the authorities are  You should go somewhere else until it's sorted and not deal with him one on one without others around until then  This is serious and there are far too many ramifications of not reporting it    Please  you know what the right thing to do is  so get the hell out of there immediately and don't go back until he is in custody  You can still be there for him later but this is absolutely beyond helping someone through a hard time I don't know if I actually did anything to push them away or if the insecurities are really just in my head  But it is true  actions speak louder because they probably wouldn't spend time with me if they didn't want to and it's not like I made them hang out with me  If there are things I'm wondering if I did wrong  I guess I should just work on those anyway to be a better person so it won't be something that actually becomes a problem in the future  Maybe just being more confident and not so needy for validation will be the main thing I need to address   I'm sorry that you feel like you need to be alone at the moment until things even out with you and your friends  I relate to that and am used to be alone at times but it still kinda sucks  Thank you for being so open and understanding  Good luck and know that you have an empathetic ear internet stranger friend wishing you the best It's not all about girls it's about life in general  Why do people complain about ugly people complaining  If you git treated like subhuman garbage because of the way you looked you would be bitter tooLove can take time  I'd say wait about another month Being "nice"     "fantastic personality "  You're  supposed  to be nice to people   Everyone is  supposed  to be nice to others   Being nice is the bare milquetoast minimum   Being nice is not interesting or fun   People with "fantastic" personalities are funny  interesting  etc   If your 5 10 nice self was chasing after 10 10 girls  of course you didn't have much success   Like I said before  you need to focus on girls who are in your league   Unless you were also going after "nice" 5 10 girls  you're a hypocrite who set himself up for failure with those unrealistic expectations The person is my SO  which I sort of hesitate to put because reddit really seems to enjoy telling people it's hopeless and you should break up  instead of actual suggestions  We live together and have done so for 2 years  though we've been together 8 This is true  I appreciate the input sir  Yeah   I just tried to laugh it off  But on the inside I was like please stop guys  I thought about going out for a coffee because it could be nearby her house  and if I starting feeling that she was uncomfortable or something  I could avoid the cringiness of her being with me on the way home  But I'm open to other suggestions  EDIT  Also  about the spark coming back  do you think it's possible to overcome my feelings if they come back Where are you talking to this guy that people just always get his attention "Cultural Marxism" isn't a thing   It's a silly term trying to blame SJWs on Marx  who was not a SJW man hater  You can certainly find success in a romantic relationship if you are straightforward and honest with your partner about your needs  You just need to find someone that has similar values regarding personal time  That said  if you can't or aren't willing to compromise on occasion you will face difficulty in any relationship  There's no reason you shouldn't pursue someone romantically if it is something you want though Yeah  I'm the delusional one and yet I haven't made a post and ignored every sensible person  I guess everyone is wrong and you're always right  If you didn't want advice  why do you post Marijuana is not physically addictive and cannot cause those things  Do you maybe have the flu You got advice first and after ignoring everyone  treating people like shit  you're getting a lecture Dude  I just KNOW I'm going to ace my next test    gets a 45   Dude  I just KNOW that THIS TIME I'm going to ace my next test    gets a 32   DUDE  I have all the confidence in the world  I'm the smartest person in the world  Just watch as I ace this next test    gets a 54   "Oh  but see  You improved that last time  You just need more confidence " 'm entitled yes  entitled to be looked at as a person  not looked down on beciase of my looks by girls who say "I don't care about looks it's personality"    You're right  you do deserve to be look at as a person   Every woman also deserves to be looked at as a person  but you're not doing that   Don't you see the hypocrisy here   You expect so much more from women than you're willing to give to them   You expect them to look into your unique personality and soul  but you don't do the same to them   Your expectations are completely unreciprocal and unreasonable Maybe you cite it as et al  Then you can provide a link or scan to the publication  I'm sure this happens a lot to people  It's very easy to find out that you were published  Sorry  I should have added this in the post  it's Bosnia and Herzegovina  And yes I'm pretty sure about how it works not from personal experience of course   basically the law says that if I'm aware of the act I'm guilty  even in cases where the intruder would've killed you True  but if presented no other optionEnd this non sustainable relationship and move on with your life  And  no  your edit doesn't change that advice Well then deal with your life issues and see what happens  You get treated that way because of your mental issues  not your looks  No one just meets a person and goes  "you're ugly" that doesn't happen  This person keeps saying you're a bitch or grumpy  They are also the only person who says this to you   Any response you give only makes it worse and doesn't appease them   Are those correct Oh I see  thanks for a detailed answer  I'm not very thrilled about kids either and that's a perk with older women  they most likely already have kids that are starting to grow up or they are without kids  At my age a lot of women wants kids  Obviously when they want the men to earn that much it's so they can bemefit from it  Btw what's a d20 and roll Did I say I go after 10 10 girls  Not  Did I say I didn't use to be considered interesting and funny   Other people's words at the time not mine  no  Now I'm not because there's no point    niw am I a hypocrite  For not wanting to be treated differently because I'm ugly  I don't treat any girls differently by looks nor am I perv  You on a night out would get checked out by 2 guys one is 5 10 and you would be like "ugh yuk that guy is perving at me" but if attest an 8 10 looked at you  Different story  It's you who's the hypocrite  Go and try attar t guys with no makeup or fake shit on at all and see your attention lessen  at least you have that option    Are you from the UK may I ask  Yes and I told you what you can do with your lecture    Are you form UK  Yeah  unfortunately finding a therapist can be a long and drawn out process  But once you find a therapist you click with and trust  that relationship is better than gold  I've been through some fucked up stuff too  and my therapist has helped me overcome so much  I wouldn't trade him for the world Break a vocal chord    Grin    Jim b  Honestly  ignore them  When someone says something  don't acknowledge what they said  Act like they never said it and move forward with the conversation  or walk away    Person 1   insert insult here  You  I can't believe it's so warm out today    Then exit stage left   Yeah exactly  Thanks for your replies That's the right thing to do  It's easy to run through a million scenarios in your head and to think about your feelings and reactions to the whole thing  but it can all be solved relatively quickly by addressing this head on  If you go to them and explain how you feel  then they should understand and respond to you explaining themselves  If you go to them and explain how you feel but they don't respond  well then this just isn't a friend that cares very much about your feelings  No matter what happened on their end or what type of hard times they're going through  then they should be able to respond with a quick  "I'm alright  Been going through some shit and just haven't had much time lately  I'll hit you up when I can "  Who knows  Maybe they lost their phone  haven't gotten around to getting a new one  and since you only text maybe once or twice a week they thought it wouldn't be a big deal and you'd get back in touch when they get their new phone  Whatever the case  going directly to them should help get to the bottom of this ASAP Well you can deal with being rejected by everyone and be miserable if you choose not to listen    I am not I know you're scared  but to be honest  it sounds like you both need to step away from each other for a while  Breaking up sucks  but he will need time to process and get over what happened  and it sounds a bit like you need to figure out what goes on with you when you drink  Letting go is really scary  but it's best for both of you right now while the dust settles   Have you ever been like that before when drinking  I would suggest that  if it's a recurring thing  you need to get help   as you mentioned in your post  You might not be able to fix things with him  and I'm really sorry if that's the case  but you can make something good come out of this situation if you choose to reflect on it and make positive changes    Wishing you all the best  OP It's like a predate date doing a date like thing without the intimacy   You are spending time together in a situation like a date trying to answer the question "we like each other could this be a thing " If it's not awkward and you have fun it could lead to something but if you don't feel the chemistry there doesn't need to be any more and neither of you lost out You've got me all wrong haha  See a lot of guys will check girls out etc  good on them and good on the girl for getting positive looks  see I don't check girls out at all because I know she wouldn't like that because I'm ugl  which that doesn't bother me  I don't expect anything form girls obviously  it's when I'm minding my own business going the store a few nights ago and a group of girls shouting things at me  yuk  ugh  Ming  eeee state of him  and laughing at me  and then a while later they walked past my house with a group of thug type guys  nothing against the guys    worst is when  like any 2 Peopl can do  are by each other  like at my work  and a I look up to a girl already looking at me  not In A good way Iv never thought that  and she looks away with an utter attitude on her because she has that "I'm better than you" look on her face after and she thinks i was checking her out is why  not sure I said that right but hopefully you get my drift  Yeah  that's not how it works  Do you think you are mentally stable  You only seem to care about looks  you're all hung up on that  Or you know  it's scripted  Have YOU ever had "movie" style conversations   I enjoy the bustling atmosphere with lots of people  it makes me more productive    It's FUCKING distracting  no  no  no FUCK  Oh good for you  You cannot make it up to her  I don't know where people get this idea  All anyone can do is move on  In order to regain her trust I think a good place to start would be to not drink again any time soon    Everyone has deal breakers and breaking points  If you had hit one of hers then she would have already broken up with you  Perhaps this is a "fool me once" situation for her  Emergen c  Tea with ginger  honey and lemon  Sleep  Spicy food helps with congestion  as does peppermint oil  Echinacea also is supposed to help  Herb pharm is a good homeopathic brand

women  Then I'll have plenty of interested girls according to her  Dad couldn't care less but from what I've gathered  he thinks I'm weird for being single I think you could   I know it can be hard and take a long time  but being bitter isn't healthy for you both biologically and psychologically   You deserve to be happy and treated kindly   You deserve and have the right to live your life and be out in public   If someone has a problem with you  then that's their problem  not yours    Virtual Internet hug  I say you should go and talk to a professional to determine what the best treatment is for you as there seems to be quite a few a characteristics of different conditions like ocd anxiety and depression which suggests your diagnosis may not be completely straight forward  so it would be best to try and clear that up and avoid self diagnosis in my opinion  Although I'm not one to talk as I've never been in therapy  Although I do have many of the symptoms of those 3 conditions you mentioned  I have extreme anxiety and ocd I am certain  But I am seeking a psychologist now to sort it out as it isn't always black and white especially with something like anxiety which affects the way you perceive things so much  it's hard to be objective when you're under its effects  and the mix of symptoms just complicates things further  Just out of interest have you been self medicating  I'm in a similar position to you where I'm starting to consider medication as it's getting really bad  but have always been a bit scared of anxiety medication  like Xanax if I was prescribed it i'd be scared to take it    hope I helped a bit anyway but I'm not too informed sorry Yeah sorry  I noticed it once I actually posted it lol  That's because looks is everything everything EVRYTHING  Iv lost out on so many job prospects etc to a guy less qualified be issue the girl interviewer doesn't want an ugly guy  true story I'm the same way OP  Except I legit don't care about others  I don't even have that "yearning" to interact and I'm never lonely  I actually hate people for the most part  My dream in life is to one day live alone in the woods  No traffic  no urban noise  no people  Ahhh that would be sweet   But yea  I just accept it as me being selfish and of the millennial generation where it's add and all about me  aka reality TV syndrome   I've come to just accept it if I'm being honest  Why isn't just hurting her him enough to get away to safety enough for you  Being so eager to kill isn't healthyNetipot Essential oilsPlease listen to me  okay  I've felt the same way you have  I felt like nothing ever works  I felt like I tried everything  I felt worthless and hopeless and alone  I've attempted suicide  I tried to hang myself from a tree in a forest near my home  I took a belt from my parents' room and went for a walk  On the way there I was terrified  but also relieved  I just wanted to end the pain  I set everything up  made a noose and climbed up the tree  I was ready  and I thought that it was my only way out  I prayed for forgiveness  then counted to ten and dropped from the branch  It broke  I had never felt so much like a failure  I sat on the forest floor and cried my eyes out  then waited for the red marks on my neck to fade and returned home  I was fourteen years old  I'm not going to lie and say that everything turned out okay  It is still a struggle  All my problems are still there  I still need lots of help and support  But the reason I didn't attempt again  and the reason that I never will attempt again  was the look on my mother's face when I told her what I'd done  It absolutely broke my heart  My family and friends all reacted strongly  but it was that look that got me the most  I imagined what it would be like in her shoes  having my only daughter  still a teenager  destroy her body and take her own life  I would never wish that pain on anyone  I know you're in a lot of pain right now  but you can be saved  You aren't too far gone  no matter what you may think  I know  I've been there  Finding the right support is key  Therapy and healthy living aren't the only solutions  There are plenty of organisations that can help you  trust me  There's also hotlines you can call  friends who you can talk to  numerous places where you can get advice and support  Medication is difficult  it can take a long time to get the right combination and dosage  But you will find it eventually  And one of the best things you can do  Live life to the fullest  and live it how you want it  You can have so many amazing experiences  find out amazing things  Do something you've always wanted to do  I know this may not make any difference  but I care about you  and I hope that you find happiness  I hope that you make it out of this awful place  because that is no way to live or feel  You can do it  I believe in you and I want you to know things to get better  I'm glad I stuck around  because although life isn't perfect  there's hope and there's happiness  PM me if you want someone to talk to  and I'm sending lots of love  Stay strong xxMaybe baking soda  Lush makes a foot powder  The bottle lasts for a long time    http   www lushusa com body foot care t for toes 03635 html   This stuff works wonders  99 99 percent of all people go their entire lifetime without ever having to kill someone in self defense I have been a little over the top while drinking before  going past my limit  having a panic attack  running off crying  etc  but it was normally really uncommon a one time thing  Now about half the time I drink  I get really sad and feel abandoned or not cared for  It's just been getting worse so I've decided I'll be happier if I don't drink  I've also made an appointment with my doctor to see what he says and to get referred to a therapist or however that works   Thank you for the advice  I'm trying to think positively and I'm doing everything I can to be a better person from now on It's hard for us to say why he acts the way he does  The best way to figure it out is to have an honest and frank conversation with him about it   I would sit him down some time when you're at home and ask if he has some time to talk  This lets him know that it's a serious conversation and not something that you can talk about in passing  Don't let any distractions occur  turn TV off  have conversation somewhere private that you're unlikely to be interrupted  etc     Sit down and just hit right at the heart of it  Tell him that you've observed over the years that when he is with customers or strangers  he lies about things  experiences  or greatly embellishes the truth  He does it less so with people he's close to  but he still does it  Tell him that as he continues to do this  it erodes the trust you have in him  Not only do you automatically not believe most of his stories  but you have a hard time telling if anything is the truth or if it's a lie   He might try to wiggle out of it  He'll say something like  "Tell me one lie I've ever said " then when you say one he'll start arguing about how that one in particular was true  The key to avoiding this is to not get sucked into it  If he says  "Name one time   " then don't take the bait  You just stick to your guns and say  "Dad  stop  Look  you know it  and I know it  You lie  I'm not here to be mad at you or start an argument about it  I'm not here to judge you  but I just want to see what we can do to put this behavior behind us  I love you  and I want to trust you  but right now I just can't  Where does this behavior come from and what can we do together to help fight through it "Yeah  you're wrong buddy  And I don't believe your story  I think you make this stuff up to validate yourself  But do you think you are mentally stable  He's just a bad boy with a good heart  can't you see  He wasn't afraid of losing me as a friend   I know the reason why he was suicidal and it certainly wasn't that   I didn't involve more people but   D told me  and we both went to our Head Of Year   I involved no one   There was no choice in it  I was forced into this situation   The main reason I got involved in the aftermath was because C was threatening D   Allegations were then thrown at me and that's where my anger came from   I was pushed into a situation  D and I did the right thing and then I'm told that I'm 'not a true friend' and that I 'ignored him in his time of need'  which I had no idea about as I was only told that morning    I'm sorry  but I escalated nothing   My apology would be for how things left off  nothing to do with an escalated situation   I appreciate your advice nonetheless  however  I standby what I've said  that I did not escalate any situation You're making massive assumptions about these women   You're not in any way looking at them as individuals   If you truly were minding your own business it was rude of those girls to laugh at you  but you shouldn't have let it bother you that much   People are rude to strangers all the time   If you're taking random remarks by strangers that personally  you seriously need to talk to a therapist and get some better coping skills   Additionally  how do you know their boyfriends were thugs   You've never met those guys   You are sick of people making assumptions and judgements about you  yet here you are doing the exact same thing    I look up to a girl already looking at me  not In A good way Iv never thought that  and she looks away with an utter attitude on her because she has that "I'm better than you" look on her face after and she thinks i was checking her out  Unless you're a psychic mind reader  there's no way you can know she's thinking that   This is called "projection"  you already believe she thinks she's better than you  no matter what she does  so you'll interpret everything she does as a fulfillment of what you already believe   This is something you can work on with a therapist or support group They were gasping when they saw the cue on the screens facing towards them  Nonetheless are shows like this part of the brainwashing Communication is super important  If he can't grow up and be open about it  and you have talked about the issue  I don't think your relationship will end well  You even said this is something you're not sure you can get passed  I would suggest ending it now before it gets worse or bring up your communication issues and tell him how serious you are about it  It almost never bothered me about the fact that I don't have a girlfirend and stuff like that but for some reason it started to get to me when one of my friends jut got married and I didn't even have a girlfirend     I know I don't have to be desperate  I'm not going to be getting into a relationship  with any girl just to be in one  I want to find a girl that clicks with me with which I to get into a relationship   The confident part I'm still working on  I'm still in the phase of fake it till you make it  but really my only lack of confidence is the fact that I don't have the experience  I'm also struggling with fear of failure and trying to get over it  might as well do both   I've been thinking of getting on a dating app site but I just didn't cause I'm not really that photogenic and also it's still texting and I suck at it  I'm better in person cause I can read the mood and her reactions but in text you can't really get emotions across so I kinda think they're not interested  especially when they're not trying to make conversation and all the work is left on me  or when they answer far too slowly   yeah  I'm really bothered by that haha   Yeah  let's hope 2017 will be a better year than 2016  I got a feeling if it will at least be interesting   Haha I swear on my mothers grave I'm not making this up lol that's not even the half of ot Yeah I have no interest in ever dating I should just stay single forever You wanted advice and people  not just me  are telling you the same thing  it's not your looks  You have no idea what I look like  It's 100  your personality and mental state  I guarantee it   Iv lost out on so many job prospects etc to a guy less qualified be issue the girl interviewer doesn't want an ugly guy  true story   How do you know that's why you didn't get the job   Did the interviewer tell you that   Because  as everyone who's seen your pics has said  you're not at all physically ugly   You're average looking   If average looks kept people from getting hired  75  of the world would be unemployed my projected numbers were pretty close to reality    About 20  percent would date asian guys  About half would date someone 5'4"  soo  20  5   10   My actual response rate was around 10 percent    of that 10  80 percent were saying hey sorry Im not interested    Of the rest they died withing 2 messages pretty much    Yeah mathsThank you so much  I've been feeling pretty down lately  you've managed to cheer me up Even at my age fuck dating we all know how it endsWhere are you from  Be worried about places without good security  If anything this story shows you can't be too trusting because of impersonators  not because of doctors giving you the wrong diagnosis No I overheard them say it Drinking seems to be a problem for you   I'd look into AA and possibly take a break from your relationship  Least all I can say is good luck   About the gaming thing  I play by the rules that people don't need to know shit about me when I'm gaming  I've had people do what you said  we're playing and then we get into talking and someone thinks they are important enough to TMI all of a sudden  Like  Neat  cool But during A game  who cares and the worst that can happen will happen because not everyone is progressive  we're online trying to escape life for a bit  not get real    Any way  you got this  I believe in you  Just don't live life looking to be A victim or making your life harder then it needs to be  try to look at situations from different perspectives Some little fat pudgy girl said to to another staff crossing my name out on the sheet "nooo not him wev got enough ugly men around here" Overheard them how  That makes no sense  You usually leave after an interviewer and if you stayed and creeped  that's pretty messed up    You're creating these lies to try and justify your insane behaviour and thoughts  Seek psychiatric help Anna and Rose are a holes  Plain and simple  Leave them in their toxic dumpster and find people who deserve your friendship   Coincidences like this happening a lot over a short period of time can make us question reality a lot  Similar things have been happening to me where very unlikely events happen basically and it seems like everything has been organised and planned to happen as it does if that makes sense  I'd say it is very unlikely to be more than coincidence  but as a huge skeptic I wouldn't dismiss it  Maybe you have a gift aha  just see over time if it continues or try and find other people who have had similar experiences to you to get an idea  you're in the right place  There's a lot of weird phenomena that happens in the mind that doesn't appear to have an explanation but is reported all the time like astral projection  Maybe we just don't understand the human mind and reality enough to determine how it can be possible  but it still very well may be  Try and consider other possible logical explanations for this  but I'd say just see if it remains accurate predictions over time that would be your best way to tell Do you think you are mentally stable If you don't trust you doctor and pharmacist  it's a good time to replace both  That's an illegal hiring practice in the U K   If that actually happened  you could successfully take legal action against them Yes more than enough  there's a rant In all of usWhy do you want to know   This is the second time you've asked me that It's not super often  maybe once or twice a month  To be fair  he may be the only person who feels like they could let me know if I were being bitchy  my coworkers wouldn't say anything  I dunno if my friends would  My mother does  but it's obvious to me when I say something I shouldn't to her and I get the reaction I expect    For simplicity's sake  I suppose the answer to both is yes Wishing you all the best OP  it's so brave to admit that you need help  You sound like an amazing mother  I know all you see are your shortcomings  but I bet you that your kid loves you more than anything in the world  One day it'll all be worth it   However  you need to take care of yourself  It takes a lot to finally say 'I need help ' I resisted getting help for months and got progressively worse  until one day I was like 'I can't keep wanting to crash my car every time I go out  I can't keep running to grab the pills when I can't take it anymore  I can't keep spending my days thinking of ways to end it ' I just couldn't  It's exhausting  And I know that unwillingness  that stubbornness to seek help  but admitting you need it is one of the strongest things you can do  Don't suffer in silence    Meds won't necessarily make you a zombie  I was lucky and got the right ones for me on the first try  I finally got up  got a job  started living my life a little again  It just takes the edge off  Not every day is sunshine and rainbows  but it makes shit a little easier to deal with  Makes you not want to just run in front of a bus when the self hatred takes over  It helps you realise that those thoughts are not you  that they're irrational and they will pass  But it takes time  For me  it got a little worse before it got better  so don't be afraid to lean on people you love   We're all here for you too  we're rooting for you  Best of luck OP and I hope that your appointment went well today  Thinking of you  and I just want you to know that a stranger is proud of you  You're brilliant   Just curious I never really pay much attention to politics so thanks for informing me about thatI don't want to come up as a rude person  but if she is putting so much effort into it  it means she truly likes you  but if you are unsure about it  you probably don't like her that much  If you don't have strong feelings for her  you probably shouldn't have dated her in the first hand  because you might never have those strong feelings for her and you might eventually break up with her  And she will be devastated for sure  I don't know you  nor this girl  but if she is willing to go so far for you  I bet she is a great girl that probably doesn't deserve this  My sincerest advice would be to have a real talk with her about it before it's too late  Waiting up for your feelings to come  when you're not even sure they will ever come is just bad  both for you and for herIt's my word against there's And you were in the room looking at the sheet to know they crossed off your name to confirm right    Not to mention if they had a sheet  I imagine they interviewed more than two people  and even IF  which I highly doubt  had said that  it could have been anyone But he never sought to confide in me   He chose to talk to D  which is fine   The reason why he never came to me however  was because he thought I was a backstabber   This didn't come from D and I going to our Head Of Year   Truth be told  C said that D was his only friend  despite everything that we had been through up until that point   Yes  I ignored him   There was such a distrust between the two of us  that I just didn't want to face him anymore   Despite that apology  tensions were still very high between us  and time just flew by   But that doesn't mean that I'm not regretful for what happened or how things ended   I am   That's what this is about I would definetly not be interested in getting into a conversation with some random man or woman on the street  I have better things to do and they should too Who cares  Masturbate  I do it multiple times a day every day  My brain works great  I'm not fat  I'm not depressed even tho I have things that should depressed me  Your're the only one limiting yourself There was a group of us there   I went to the toilet down a little corridor and on my way back I heard her say it after the other staff said my name asking her before she crossed my name out Probably is xD d20   20 sided die You roll to see if you accomplish a task  It's a D D reference Sounds like you're in a dissociative state  My advice  find a therapist and get medicated  Both saved my life Read some of my other comments  I have lists of things I do  I find that mindfulness is the biggest thing that helps me  I often find myself feeling sad or anxious when thinking of the past or the future  so staying in the moment is necessary for me to feel happy and optimistic   Some of the most useful things for me are writing about my feelings  going through CBT exercises   a couple great apps are Calm in the Storm  The Worry Box  Moodspace  Moodtools  there are a lot more out there too  Find something that works for you  Understanding your thought patterns can do wonders for getting past negative cycles   Other things that help me     exercise  forces me to be in the moment and clears my head   reading  getting my mind off of myself and thinking about other things   creating  I love making crafts and jewelry  It gives me an outlet to express myself and keeps my mind busy    playing with pets   reading about other people  whether it be articles  videos  reddit threads  etc  focusing on other people's lives and hardships puts mine into perspective  It forces me to stop thinking about only myself    Hope some of these help you too  You can message me if you would like to MASTURBATE FOREVER IF IT MAKES YOU HAPPY You say you want to kill yourself  and have tried before  You really    REEEEALLY think that mentally stable people want to kill themselves  Your whole story makes no sense   Why would they have even said that in front of you   Why would you even be present when they were crossing names off the list   That's highly unusual Well  I'd say I feel regret for ignoring their message   I was blinded with anger at that point  and really just wanted to think   Time just flew by too quickly   I have a message planned and written  I just don't know if I should send it is all A sane and reasonable person who knows your mentally unstable  Works every time  http   i1 kym cdn com entries icons original 000 014 711 1380697092809 jpg Why does it matter though   Why did you only ask me this question and none of the other commenters wow  nice  What country may I ask  in the U S   this is NOT the case at all  A few states are opening up the records to some extent  only for adults   but other states you'd basically would need an executive order if even that to get at the records I didn't know what that meant until I looked it up just now  Some of the "telltale signs" rang true which on the one

second guesses herself even when I feel like I remember something more accurately than her  She gets down on herself pretty hard and I think her past trained her to be that way for self preservation  I think I may have put myself in this situation to keep her from plummeting into depression which was something we faced earlier into our relationship  I'll talk to someone about it because I also want to help her  She's done therapy in the past and I want to do it first this time around so it's not a situation where I flat out tell her she's wrong and needs help  I want to get better too if I can Dude  I'm not some bloodthirsty maniac  If someone broke into your house with a gun  it's either you or him  If he's some amateur robber that's unarmed of course I'm not going to kill him Tell him that you consider his debt to you paid  and that you gave him that money as a gift in the first place   Taking care of himself and his needs is more important than paying you back as far as you are concerned   Then  what you do with the friendship after that is up to you       Good luck Yeah  that didn't happen  Why are you asking for advice if you're going to be rude and not listen I'm well aware  this is just a what if scenarioDo you suffer from anxiety depression  Because it sounds like the alcohol exacerbates any underlying issues that you may have  Are you stressed out   You're taking steps to improve the situation  you've recognised there's a problem  That's a brave thing to do  It sucks that there was a catalyst for that  but honestly you're doing all you can right now  You can't reverse what happened  and I know you wish you could  but what you're doing now counts for a lot  It means you won't do something like that again   I'm rooting for you  Try to be strong  try to be open to taking a break while you fix what's going on  It's hard when you really love the person  but he needs to do what's best for him too  I know you understand that  even if the idea of it is hard to accept  xIt sounds like her lawyer has grounds to sue for libel  Also  video surveillance may lead to criminal charges for trespass  property damage and theft  It seems to me that these protesters are flirting with criminal records and jail time Iv tried 4 times  with a belt on a door handle  I'm desperate to do it  desperate  And if I don't I'll one day join Isis and blow a load of people up or shoot them or chop their heads off  at least then I'll have some purpose  I watch Isis killing people videos all the time  yesterday I watched a video where they killed a guy by running over with him with a tank  I got a thrill from it  thought to myself  that's me one day doing that with a grin like no other  I'm not joking lol I watched one earlier  I'm really sorry to hear how a tough a place you're in right now  I'm no psychologist so I can't pretend to know what you're experiencing but I can say that I think you should talk to a therapist or whatever and then discuss with somebody what they think the best course of action would be as I know it can be pretty hard to think rationally during times like these   Hope everything turns out for the best  if you ever need somebody to talk to don't hesitate to message me  You seem to have a drinking problem and I don't understand why you're making yourself out to be the victim in this situation  Be happy you're not facing domestic violence charges and work on healing yourself The alternative is for people to wonder if you might be incel which is one of the lowest status positions in our society   Yep  Okay  now I know you're trolling  I am almost 21  been single my whole life  Now I'm not the most outgoing guy  so one thing I want a relationship for is that constant source of companionship  which sounds really nice  Plus  it's a constant source of sex  which sounds great too  Many of my friends who have gone through relationships and break ups tell me that it's better being single though  And hey  they might be right  But I really want to try a relationship for myself first    Edit  I totally understand what you're saying though OP and I envy your attitude about this Keep the lawyer  and consider getting a restraining order against these girls   Lol this world is such a fucking joke  La Liberté  is being redefined  now on death the government has a presumption of ownership of your body   This is a slippery slope and a  précédent terrible  There are special locks keys that are not duplicable  but it really depends if your landlord has them and wants to actually use them   I'm really sorry this is happening to you though  I live in a three bedroom with four guys and we have people over all the time  but we and our guests  know better   Just remember  you're worried for not only your safety  but everyone else's since you live in a shady neighborhood  your boyfriend has a gun  and you don't know these people Good point  I might be reaching the end with this one  Been wasting a lot of time  Appointment next Monday  Good luck to meI know where the other guys form  Jim not asking for city street and door number just the country  UK or US  I'm form the UK  See lolIt sounded like you're whining about not being able to kill    I swear to god I'm not  I do watch Isis videos a lot  and I wouldn't say no to being accepted by them  On my mothers grave I'm not lying or trolling  You'll learn over time that part of being an adult is having these difficult conversations  I'm 30 and I'm officially in my "cut through the shit" stage now  As you get older  you get more busy and have less time  It becomes more difficult to stay in contact with people  even family   so it takes real effort  On top of that  since you have limited time for your limited relationships  you want them to be healthy ones   Confrontation is difficult  but it's not inherently a bad thing  People think of confrontation as bad  but if it's approached correctly it's the most healthy thing possible   Think about if you like a girl  You get to know her  you have a crush on her  You hang out a bit and you flirt a bit  It's fun and exciting and you want to take it to the next level  but you're afraid of rejection and having her make a big deal out of it  So you just go on the way things are hoping that at the right time things will fall into place  So you spend months on this girl  maybe years   and finally you get sick of waiting around and ask her out  Either she says yes and you realize you could have been dating her months and months ago  or she says no and you realize you wasted so much time chasing a girl who wasn't into her   Or  you approach this scenario the 30 year old way and as soon as you like her say  "Hey  I really enjoy spending time with you and you're really good looking on top of it all  What would you say to going out on a date with me this Saturday " Bam  Cut straight to it  Either she says yes and you get right to it  or she says no and you are free to chase after a girl who actually likes you   Same situation here  Either you can spend all this time waffling around not wanting to get rejected or make a big deal out of things  or you speak up for yourself  You have feelings and it's okay to address that  If this person is any kind of friend then they will want to do what they can to make you feel better and to prevent this sort of thing from happening again   Sometimes there are just disconnects or miscommunications in relationships  and they need to be figured out and addressed  No voluntary relationship should ever make one or both of the people feel bad  If something like that happens  then the two people in that relationship need to work together to make sure it doesn't happen again  If there's enough of these situations that keep popping up or if one person's intentions don't align with the other person's  then it becomes time to end the relationship and find someone who better aligns with you  But if you never bring this up  he never knows there's an issue   Lastly  I'll tell you a quick story about my best friend  Back in high school my friends and I hung out all the time  We would initiate every hangout and call him up to join  Sometimes he wouldn't want to go  so he would just ignore us  When we text and call and don't get a response  we give him some time to respond because it would be better for us if he was there than if he wasn't  But when this kept happening  we kept wasting an hour here or an hour there waiting for him to call back that he would or wouldn't go   Finally we confronted him about it and said  "Dude  it's okay if you don't want to hang out every time  Even if you've got nothing going on  just say  'Sorry guys  I'm just gonna chill at home' " It's perfectly fine if he wants to not come  but he should just let us know then so we don't wait around  After we confronted him about that  he was really good about responding and no one's feelings were hurt  That's a much better ending than us just continuing to get ignored by him and not addressing it Rarely  but enough that I can see why they're written like they are  Sometimes you're on point and say the most clever things  And some people are much better at it than others You need to pull out the big guns here  I'm sure she would appreciate the gesture if you took her out    glad you're ok OP  sounds like you've got a great girl there  Hope it all works out I am going to start seeing a therapist soon because tomorrow I plan on getting that help and I'm not just ignoring what he's trying to say I understand something's he's said and I'm using that to help myself improve but some other things I'm just not sure I can do maybe it's possible but it's not a easy thingNothing is different   We still have our mutual friends  and we haven't spoken since   Whenever we're in the same room  it's an awkward atmosphere   However  my plan would be to apologise for ignoring their last messages   I was angry and needed time  and as I've said time just flew   I have it all written out  I just don't know if I should send it   I'd hardly think that it has anything to do with my ego   And I struggle to see how it would help my ego   I feel regretful for how things between him and I left off   That's what I'm feeling They lose them like they get them  honey  And by that time  you'll be out with girlfriends having a good time or cuddled up with a REAL man watching a movie and won't even care  It's just like exercise let it hurt  feel it  Cry  scream  get it out  Don't hold onto a single feeling he's left you with  Let it go  When it's all over  love will fit a little more deeply inside you  thanks to him  Be well  friend Do not make posts like anymore  especially if you're not going to participate after you make it  Only warning You not going to answer  Just want to know are you British or American or anything else  Because it's different to what we've been talking about in other countries If that's how you truly feel  I hope you do die then so that you don't do anything stupid to others  No wonder nobody likes you  the type of relationship I have with my girlfriend is your typical vanilla relationship  She is extremely jealous of any girl I talk to or look at for more then a second  I also get somewhat jealous  This is natural as we love each other so much that we feel threatened when there is another in the picture  Yet our 4 year relationship where we lived together for more than 3 years started in college when I was 19 and she was 18  I never really got to play the field sexually before her  but I know from reading through her old facebook messages  i know I creeped  shes had more sexual partners than I could count on one hand   This kind of makes me want to explore and enjoy my youth but I do love her and feel comfortable with the stability that she found with me  Its all sexual frustration on my part as I have even went to see an escort once and cried on the drive home   feeling like a piece of shit for doing it behind her back  I've hinted at swinging and shit by asking her to go to a sex club with me to which she asks what we would do there and I'd tell her  'I don't know  have sex in front of others ' and shes like 'Noo   I don't think I'd be comfortable with that ' and then yet she says another time  'If we were to have a threesome it would be with Margot Robbie ' and whenever I ask for a threesome with two girls she would ask for two guys but that me and him do shit together for which I shut down immediately  So I have tried to talk to her about it  I don't want to be a piece of shit  I do want to be with my now girlfriend  Its all a mess I was alone during university  I got through it by spending my time studying and finding an internship  And well I sorta saw it as a sorta symbiotic thing like you help me and I try to help you get your life on track getting you to college and improving how you feel and maybe working out ur "dipping" stuffDear lord  What kind of stuff have you tried  online  in bars clubs  I can't believe this is real  I refuse to  I don't want to God no  the last thing I want is blood on my hands  just shooting someone would be scarring enough for my conscience  I might accidentally kill them if I shoot so are there any other options besides running and hiding  As a group of people who have every reason to be entirely negative  there's a surprisingly amount of positivity here when called for and posts rarely get ignored  I agree  I know "Forever Alone" exists as a kind of parody and people can joke about it but when I first came here and started reading it felt like a real community where people understand each other  I browse reddit using another account  this is sort of a more personal account  but I feel posting here really helps me ease some of my frustrations  I also got my first and ever reddit gold here in this sub  which was nice   He is a piece of shit for real  Yet  I know who he was before and I feel like I don't think he will change unless he gets help  which he won't seek Thanks  learned something new todayYou replied a few times  I'm going to guess things froze up a bit  I wasn't saying he was suicidal about losing you  I really doubt it had anything to do with anyone else  Depression is an inner struggle  One of loneliness and pain  I know you're bothered by my comment  but I wasn't saying it to attack you  I'm trying to help you see his perspective  There are perfectly rational reasons for his actions  He was  and may still be  troubled by his own life  So reconciling with him may be the best option  But if you're unwilling to bow a knee for even a friend  and take the blame to say you're sorry  I don't suggest bothering him  He sounds like he has enough troubles as it is  He should have to feel like he needs to apologize any more than he already has  It will only drive him further into depression   Have a good life with your at least adequate looks  OP  you also have adequate looks   Your looks are not the problem Hey  I wish you well  I have done the polypharmacy thing but I trusted my doctor  and my pharmacist  to keep me out of trouble  If I hadn't had trusted both of them  it would have been a terrifying experience  So     yeah  If you don't fully understand why you are on each and every drug and the reasoning behind those decisions and believe that your doctor has your safety in mind with ALL of your medications  including ones not prescribed by him her  then you need to re evaluate that relationship  Trust is huge  I know my pdoc pours over potential interactions with everything I take  Everything down to over the counter things like Tylenol that I might take on a fairly frequent basis because psych meds can have all kinds of strange interactions    Be safe  Happy New Year Don't  try  to date people  Just hang out  make friends  have fun  do what you like  There's no way to know if you'll have chemistry with someone until you get to know them as friends first  As for texting  maybe get into some chat groups  They're a great way to meet people with common interests all around the world  and I know plenty of people who've found partners that way  my sis and her wife  for example   Good luck dude If you were just overhearing them  how did you know the speaker was "a fat little pudgy girl "  Your story is full of holesMe too bro  now you know why I want to kill myself  Iv tried and tried and tried but now Iv given up beyond repair  Last night  again im not lying I swear  I had a dream that me and these 2 guys beat a person to death  it was like it was so real to the exact gory details  and I hid the body  I woke up crying at 7 32am to be exactThis  I understand you love him OP but clearly he's not the person you thought he was  You are in love with a lie    Something to ask yourself is "Am I willing to go to jail for a lie "It isn't exactly the same as being talked over  What I meant to ask was do people really listen to and try to understand your talk  to see things from another perspective  good listeners do these   or do people just listen because they are waiting to talk again   I can say "lemme finish then blah blah" and the other person still won't 'listen' Are you from us or uk  Can I please know  I'm conflicted myself with the issue of weed like I think it could get rid of my anxiety stress of Depression but that I shouldn't because it might mess me up and make me stupidThe speaker was the girl who Interviewed me  I know it can feel really bad to have people make assumptions about your character based on the way you dress and I'm really sorry to hear that you have been judged like that   I think if I were you I'd consider if you are changing for others or for yourself and if you really want to change or if you're just momentarily hurt by something somebody said to you   If you really want to change how you are perceived maybe hang around some fashion subreddits and find a new style that you like and try it out    You may be right  but in the end it doesn't really matter  does it  You're still watching movies wishing you could be more like them  The only way out of the bind is to take it into your own hands  and learn from the experience  Instead of comparing people  analysing your odds  and figuring out your stats  watch yourself "do"  All the information you could possibly need to get where you need to go is right in front of you  in the moment  in the air between you and the people you talk to  Be aware  of yourself most of all  of your body and your intentions  and you'll see that there are probably a lot of things that happen that you weren't aware of  Some of them you were meaning to so  some of them not  When you're playing a game  you have to know what's happening before you can even have a chance of getting better  And then you just get better  It's hard initially  but it gets easier and easier  Your question is hopelessly vague  Learn to ask better questions  It's impossible to answer your question as you've asked it because it doesn't make any sense   This is startlingly rude  "Learn to ask better questions"   On a mental health sub  I'm new to the board and hope this isn't standard   He reminds me of Negan from The Walking Dead I admire and thank you for your honesty   I'll surely consider it   However  we never really know what will happen do we   We don't know if a situation like this will ever arise again   But again  thank you watYou're very welcome   I'm sorry you were feeling down lately  but I'm glad you were able to be cheered up  even just a little  Role playing probably people try to make it interesting that wayIt still is your decision  Are you illiterate I try going to social events  gatherings and things but I don't feel I ever fit in  I'm not overly talkative nor do I have many stories to share  thanks to my mostly boring life  so I find myself struggling to relate to people  Plus after a while I just start to feel exhausted from trying to talk and socialise so I'll usually quietly try and slip away Ok  People have different boundaries  Just because your willing to do something doesn't mean she has to be too  Maybe she's done something similar in the past and got burned so she doesn't do it any more Uni can be the best time of your life  you just have to know how  Do you always try talking to new people you meet  If so  how are you approaching them and why doesnt it work out for you  Saying you just cant talk to people is too simple  Look deeper for problems and then examine why you fail  and then we can look for solutions Why not just keep everything else the same  but stop smoking  When you throw everything in the air  why would you be surprised if you felt differently  A lot of healthy food can be not so gentle on the GI tract  I would feel awkward doing that  It also leads to people making fun of you  I've seen examples with other people trying that out  It sucks  Why do people complain about ugly people complaining   The phrase "ugly people complaining" does not apply to you  because you're not ugly  as evidenced by your pictures      If you git treated like subhuman garbage because of the way you looked  If you get treated like subhuman garbage  it's because you  act  like subhuman garbage   Your looks are completely average   Your personality is creepy and aggressive   Girls don't want to be around you because you make them uncomfortable with your personality I'm sorry if I came across as though I was trying to make myself the victim  I was mostly just writing out what I was feeling because I had to get it out  He is most definitely the victim and I feel awful  I know there's nothing I can do to change what happened but I know I can do something to change myself and I am actively pursuing that I agree  My concern is that some BPD pts get wrapped up in stigmatizing in such a way that it sort of supports a notion that they can rationalize    or even have a right to    their stress driven regressions and lashing out toward others who they  project  https   www google com webhp sourceid chrome instant ion 1 espv 2 ie UTF 8 safe off q projection psychology  as potential abusers  I went through a phase of that myself years ago and have seen it in other BPD  PPD and SZ pts many  many times  Do you two have a really blunt way of communication   If this is a recent thing that he's been doing  has he been under any stress  Changes in behaviour   Has he ever told you this in front of other people  Uni does give you much more opportunities to fill the void  If you find  a field that you truly enjoy  you can spend all your free time on it  One of the best ways to fight loneliness    Also  if you just do what you like  I'm sure you will find other people with the same interests  Making sure your house is really good protected so you won't need to worry about such stuff would be really convenient I believe    Or you can move out with friends which would be safer than being alone   You can have some pepper spray in your room near your bed where you can find in dark in case someone gets in  You can find a place in a neighborhood known for its safety   I want this every day  The return of those words is so lovely and fulfilling  Average means ugly your either attractive or your not If you don't want the help of science  you get to live without it  There is nothing as effective as drugs for alleviating symptoms that are the root of your suffering  I'm an American citizen but I've lived in London and Oxford  so I am familiar with both cultures      No     He's not a pedophile that's committed to not acting on his urges  He has acted  Child porn is not a victimless crime  He has  directly  contributed to the abuse of children     He's not the "same man"  He's been lying to OP about who he is and quite possibly using her as a cover    sure it's important to be supportive of people with mental illnesses but once they have  decided to hurt someone  the time for professional help is gone   He has broken the law  multiple times  He has actively  soberly  chosen to help get children abused by adding onto the demand for CP  That's not someone who deserves to hear "I'm so sorry for you  let's get through this together" that's someone who deserves to hear their fucking Miranda rights being read to them There's no easy way to break the news to your family  I guess because you might be afraid of how they would react  There's also probably the part where half of you wants to get help  but the other half is afraid to do so  and clings to the disorder   It sounds like your step mother is concerned  and from her past experience  may worry for your health and safety  If you're not comfortable sharing with her  maybe an appointment with a different medical professional might help   I believe the first step is realising that you have a problem  and accepting that you need help  You may not feel like you need or want help the next day  but write it down and make an appointment and keep to it    It's absolute torture  I've been through it  and bingeing still haunts me  I'm lucky because my family has grown to be supportive  even if in the beginning everything was calamity    You've realized how much it hurts you  that's good  Sometimes our minds and the disorder is too strong however  It's hard to do this alone  and I truly hope you get support and help   I believe your step mother wouldn't respond with any 'I told you so's  especially since she's been through it and she must know how much you hurt   Her comments might rub you the wrong way  but sometimes people don't know how to word things  My mother has always been concerned and caring  but for years she's always said the wrong things that only caused distress and hurt  I think that by sharing this with your step mother  it might bring the both of you closer   Don't struggle alone  please  Don't let it ruin your life further    Seeking help is incredibly difficult  and your frustration is understandable  Telling someone isn't a sign of weakness  This illness isn't a sign of weakness  Please don't be afraid I can't talk to people and be interesting  Be normie  make people be friends with me etc  How is that too simple Yes  Get lots of rest  drink lots of fluids  and wait about a week  She's probably projecting  because it makes her feel like she's not alone  I know I used to do this  and sometimes I still do  Does she go to group therapy  That might help her  Volunteering at an animal shelter or food kitchen or something along those lines might be good too  it'd help her feel in control and like she's doing something good with her time   You definitely need to focus on your own happiness  If that doesn't include her  then that's the way it's gotta be  I hope you both find what's right for you I'm undecided and have no interests besides playing video games  Friends don't just happen for people like me I have seen schizophrenic and psychotic bipolar pts on as many as 14  He has actively chosen to contribute to  fucking child abuse  this isn't a meth addiction where he's only harming himself  He  Is  Harming  Children   What if OP could save those children by turning him into the police  They could track down where the photos came from  But the route  you  want her to take completely disregards the children  And for what  Love  Fuck that  You're prioritizing feelings over lives  Nobody on such shows can ever be described as a 'normie' I'd say this is a case of money not being as important as her welfare  and that it would be a good idea to keep seeking professional help that she is happy with  that's my opinion  Life is hard and circumstances can overwhelm and make you forget what is important  I'd say get her to find a new hobby or some kind of outlet  even charity work  Helping others can make you feel good about yourself and rediscover the vitality for life you might lack  Meditation is another thing I suggest to everyone as I feel that that was what transformed my life for the better and can help a lot with anxiety  It reduced my panic attacks a lot   But sorting out her career so she's got something to be optimistic about and look forward to will take a big burden off her shoulders  I feel like perhaps she may be someone who places a lot of expectations on herself and when life has been tough to her  it has discouraged her and knocked her self esteem somewhat  Would you say that sounds right at all  I just say this as a masters in biology sounds very demanding and to get to the end of that and find disappointment can be shattering  But the disappointment is a direct result of expecting a great job at the end of it  But if you can be content with less in life you will worry yourself a lot less  and I think she needs to relax and try and concentrate on something productive to stay in a positive mindset  I'm no expert but this is just my advice I hope I helped in the slightest  good luck I wish her wellPeople generally assume I'm content because that's what I show them  I have never been diagnosed with anything but I have seen professionals in the past  in high school  mostly because I was self harming and having bad mood swings   I am suspecting something may be wrong with me though since I have been having what I assume are panic attacks when I'm sober  uncontrollable crying  hyperventilating  heart racing  shaking  and I have been feeling kind of stressed for just the smallest things   And I will do exactly what you've recommended  Tonight when we talk  I'll make it clear to him that I'm the one who did him wrong and that we can take a break for as long as he needs it  I'll make it known that I'm doing everything I can to be a better person and I'll tell him I love him no matter what happens   You give really good advice  thank you again I do not know whether it helps or not  but I quited masturbaition nearly a year ago  but emotionally I am a lot worse off  not because I stopped  it is unrelated to that   So I just want to say that contrary to expectations  abstaining from masturbation will not solve your problems at once  Maybe if you try to become less socially awkward at first  and use that to quit fapping  or simply if you think of quitting masturbation not as the cause of positive changes  but as an effect of changing your mentality  your attitude  that helps also   Maybe I am just rambling  but this is what came to my mind Rap R BIf one was invalidated  insulted  rejected  disclaimed

   7  Moderate exercise  Because it is the single healthiest of the distractions one can use to yank oneself out of the paradigm for a while     and  it can help to "massage" the brain so that it responds more quickly to psychotherapy Perhaps your partner is just getting early onset Alzheimer's  Perhaps you married them because it's your job to do those things in a loving marriage  Perhaps you are just questioning why you got married  and this is why divorce happens  because you begin to question why you get annoyed   Maybe you should just wear clothes with more sheep material in it  Or you could just hate monogamy and prefer to explore more than just one which is another reason you should not have gotten married I'm feeling better than I was this morning  Sadness for me is never something explosive  it's such a slow burn  I've never cried over any of this  but it'd probably better than the weight in my gut  and feeling sad every time I'm reminded of something that we enjoyed together  or something I did wrong    I should get on the exercise I think  I always feel good after doing anything  it's usually DIY as a get a pretty good workout luugging barrels of beer around all day at work  But I did draw up a body weight fitness thing once  I think I'll get back on it  I also want to carry on learning Polish  but I'd like to do more things that aren't sat in front of my computer  I might try exercising whenever I feel low  normally I'm okay  especially if I have something to be doing  but it might just give me that short term lift I need when things feel at their worst   That place is fantastic  It's honestly been slowly lifting my spirits ever since I subbed    Thanks for reading and responding  it means a lot mate  See what I mean   People are mean to you because you are mean to others   You can't expect anyone who sympathize with you when you're so hostile   Get mental health  or kill yourself   Your problems are all about behavior  nothing about looks Yeah now that I think of it pepper spray is pretty good or a taser  do you by any chance know if stun guns or rubber bullets are allowed in civilian use The thing is  I'm not addicted to alcohol  I never drink unless I'm at a party or having the occasional wine with dinner  I think there's a deeper underlying issue that arises when I drink so I'm going to seek therapy to find out what that is and I'm probably just never going to drink again since I honestly really don't even like drinking  It has always been just a thing I do socially How they sposed to know you want em if u don't flirt wit em Sheep They're attractivePlease die of unimaginable insufferable Ebola And I'm sure there are exactly as many saying 'me and my mom' or 'me and my sister' or 'me and my friend'  you just notice the girlfriend ones more because you ain't got one Go to a women's shelter  take the cat to a shelter ad on craigslist  If you're religious  seek help at a church temple mosque etc  If you don't already have one  get any job and save your money  Shelters  goodwill  and the Salvation Army all  from what I understand  help people in your position  Definitely look into section 8 housing  as long as you can prove employment you should be good to rent  Best luck  Stay safe Sad that you get downvoted for having preferences Edit wasn't looking to alter advice  I was just trying to be as clear as I can be  Thank you for your advice People often accuse you of what they are guilty of  Not always  but I find it's pretty common with manipulation and abuse  Coming from someone who went through abuse of their own  it will get easier to stand up for yourself  Have a relationship with your dad and sister  That doesn't mean you need one with your mom  You are worthy of love  care  and compassion  Other people can take the maternal figure in your life    Sending love  I'm an incel and I'm very high in society  I'm beautiful  smart and talented  Just cause I can't get dick doesn't mean I'm worthless XD Same here  always thought hating on these people is pointless  but that's besides the point   Realistically you should talk to him  Bash it out  Perhaps you should ease into the conversation  that way it won't be as heated hopefully  Just remember he's still the person you love  and even though this is a terrible situation I'm sure you'll make it though   After scrolong through the other comments I do mind kind of agree with calling the police if you feel threatened however  Staying safe should be the most important thing Here's a non exhaustive list       Agnes Obel

artists and spotify linksNo  oil Please see my long reply on the thread "Prescribed Mirtazapine but scared to take it " Instead of  or in addition to  the books suggested there  I would have a look at Gershen Kaufman's and Silvan Tompkin's work on shame  I think that there are a few things to consider here  some of which may be of the utmost seriousness   To begin  this obviously a matter not to be taken lightly  so sentimentalities on the matter should be avoided  and all issues should be discussed clearly  openly  and sincerely  I am not offering professional advise or insight by any means  but am instead simply expressing my own personal opinion based on experience    It seems to me therefore that something to seriously consider is public safety  More specifically  the quite literal safety of children  But before I move on to the specifics  I think there are a few relevant points to consider which few people are likely to accept as facts  but which may be of significant importance  This should be blatantly obvious since there are quite a few people claiming that the children in the pictures were beings abused  when in fact OP clearly specified that they were pictures which seem to have been taken at public places with the exception of the one which was last to be mentioned  Therefore  much of the so called "advice" on this thread are emotional exaggerations   The first thing to recognize is that many "pedophiles" do not have actual sexual desires  Actually  the word pedophile in itself makes this obvious  since the word  phile  or  Philo  may mean love  and the word  pedo  relates to children or youth  Therefore  some  emphasis on the word some  people called people "pedophiles" actually feel a non sexual type of affection for children which may become  confused  for sexual attraction  without any  actual sexual desires simply because they do not know how to interpret their own feelings  Hence why there are many cases in which some pedophiles claim that they "would never hurt children"  Because they have no actual desire to do so  but instead  think  that they like children   The reason why some people  called pedophiles   think  that they like children is actually quite interesting  Note that I am not describing those who actually hurt children  but those who feel allured by the sight of children  Those are two very different perspectives  To be allured by something  and to want to hurt something are two very different type of feelings   Pedophiles may often be people who  feel  that they did not have childhoods  Actually  it is a rather well known fact that many pedophiles were raped as children  Therefore  to ardently hate all pedophiles without discernment or discrimination is quite ridiculous  since many of them were victims as children  It may be said that later on as adults they become victims of their victimhood   Therefore  some people  including those who claim who to have never had a childhood  usually feel allured by the sight of children because they seem innocent  Since people  always  desire what they what they feel they do not have   Pedophiles may see children as perfectly innocent  which then sets up a very extreme irrational form of contrast  Since pedophiles set up children on such high pedestals in regards to innocence  they may feel very low in comparison  very guilty or "dirty"  Because of that feeling of guilt  paedophiles might often perform acts of self harm do self hate or shame  and some may eventually act out on the persona of a "dirty" or "evil" person which they  think  or  feel  that they are when comparing themselves to children which they may see as perfectly pure  Note again  that I am not referring to people who hurt children  but people who feel allured by  or who claim to admire the sight of children   The second factor to consider is the illegality of the matter  and this is of significant importance    The facts are that if you take those pictures to a police department  not only will he likely be sentenced to imprisonment but will most likely live in pretty unfavorable circumstances even by prison standards  The facts are that people in prisons do not care about what he may have or may not have done  and may go out of their way to quite literally torture  or even rape him  This is why any decision that you make should not be taken lightly   It may be of some use to consider the fact that as you said  you yourself were a meth user  I personally hold no judgments against meth users  but we should all be able to recognize the fact that people who use meth are not only looked down upon by many people but also criticized and judged almost systematically  Therefore  you should be able to recognize the fact that the common opinion doesn't always tell the full story so to speak  The popular notion of meth users says very little about your personal experience and feelings which caused you to use meth  At the same time  you may be able to appreciate the mercy which many people may have shown you by not involving law enforcement when you were doing something obviously illegal   Now  I am not at all suggesting that you  not  inform a police department  and neither am I suggesting that you should because of the following reasons   One the one hand  we should consider the very serious  possibility   not necessarily a  probability   that he may someday hurt a small child  I am not saying that he ever will  but I am suggesting that such a risk should be seriously considered  In my opinion  if we were to  know  for a fact that he has such a desire  then I would suggest that you inform a police department immediately  In my opinion  it is not only yours but every person's responsibility to inform law enforcement of any serious possible threat or danger to the safety of children   The reason I do not feel comfortable advising you with a full conviction on way or the other is because of what actually happened and what is  likely  to happen if he is sent to prison  To begin  I think we can all agree that the pictures are not the sign of a healthy individual  However  based on what you described  they are also not pictures of child abuse  If they were  then I would suggest that you advise a police department immediately  However  they seem to have the type of pictures most parents have of their children  I know some parents keep pictures of their own children bathing  among with all sorts of pictures which they might rather openly display to the child's husband or wife when they are older  So the content of the pictures  suggest  or  implies  that your boyfriend is not psychologically healthy  However  based on the information which you described  I think that most people would be unfazed by the content of the pictures in an  appropriate circumstance   It is not difficult to imagine a parent showing a friend pictures of their child's gymnastic performance  or showing their  30 year old son's picture as 5 year old on the toilet to his 30 year old wife while he is in the same room  Therefore  I think that the content of the pictures needs to be set into perspective   At the same time  if you report him to a police official  he will likely go to prison  he will suffer  and his life may be permanently ruined  All because of a few pictures  without having hurt anyone  Actually  if you think about the facts  that abused children can grow to become pedophiles  he might have been abused as child  Do you know what his childhood was actually like   I feel that most people are likely to overlook some sort of fact or possibility in the crafting of their personal convictions  I however  advise you to follow your own intuition on the matter  If you report him  his life will most likely be ruined and he will suffer  even though he may have hurt no one and may have helped you at times  If you do not report him  then he might someday hurt a small child    Therefore  it is all up to you  how well you know him  and what you feel is the right thing to do  I personally feel that no one can fault you for choosing to do the right thing  this comment made me and my girlfriend laugh a lotthanks for the reply  I do like these kind of conversations but I feel as though nobody my age is really can relate to that and thinks you are weird if you take a conversation beyond witty humour  which is fine if you are good at it and since I would definitely not consider myself as very good at it  I get bored by it quite quickly I am into some instrumental   This  https   www youtube com watch v U gRg piz M  is one of my favourite tracks  Besides that  some rap too  Childish Gambino and Kendrick Lamar are pretty awesome It sounds like someone drugged your drink  to be honest  Maybe they thought it was someone else's  Or maybe it was just a unexplainable bad reaction to alcohol  who knows    Still  I would not touch any booze at all from this point on to repair the relationship  Let her tell you when it's okay to drink again  I don't think so but I have no idea    in my country you get away with raping because you attended to the trial in a suit and the woman you raped was wearing a dress when you raped her   I should wear more clothes with sheep oil in them  What does that even mean  Me Having been there  I can suggest the following  because they all worked for me     1  If you're

and anime soundtracks mostly Hi buddy  we've all been there  all for different reasons  but we all know that feeling   Forget trying to figure it out or wonder what's going through her head  or whether you did something wrong  you won't make any sense of it  and you'll likely imagine the worst and create your own imaginary enemy   I'm in a place at the moment where I'm getting too much of my self worth from what people think of me after losing a girl and a previous abusive relationship  I didn't need that before  and I'll get back there eventually    How are you for hobbies  Freinds  Job  I've always gotten most of my sense of worth from those things  Not only do they take your mind off it  but it's something you're doing for yourself  things you build and create that demonstrate your worth to yourself  Exercise is also supposed to be great for it    I'll be honest I'm not much good when it comes to emotional support and such  I never know what to say  Just know that there's plenty of people out there who do really care about you  and would be devistated if you jumped in front of that train  even in such an elegant manner    It hurts  It'll hurt less after a while  and soon after that  you'll be in a more emotionally secure position where it won't hurt like that again  and you will fret less    Love you bud  and for the love of god  see the sidebar if you're actually contemplating suicide  Even at your darkest  life has hope and potential  You could work it out with her  you could meet someone else  you will grow and flourish as a person  none of that will ever happen if you cut it off based on something that I promise you will forget about in a few years  Even if the handsomest guy in the world told me all the things you're saying  most girls would still reject him    Don't you see   Your personality is such shit that even if you were a 10 10 looks wise  nobody would want you   Please get help   Your family and friends must be so sick of your shit at this point   Forget about women for a minute  and think of your loved ones   They must feel so awful when they hear and see you being so shitty   If you won't get help for your own sake  do it for your loved ones' sake I cant do the work for you  Look deep into how conversations between you and strangers go and compare that to other people who have success  From there you can work on your social skills  There is no magic trick to it  just trial and error  Take risks and you may get rewards Thank you for sharing  I guess you are right  So try focusing on one thing first  Pretty much everything besides country  Nowadays if I like a song  I just like it  HipHop Rap  Death Metal Metalcore  Indie Classic Rock  Vaporwave Retrowave  even a bit of pop  I do prefer songs lyrics that are sad and depressing though  like I actively seek shit like that out If one person you tell decides that you're less worthy of being their friend  and one person supports you and helps you recover and makes those accommodations that you need  it's an overall win  If you tell no one  your friend's attitude is actually still the same  they just don't know the truth  But you won't get the support so you do yourself out of something really worthwhile that could help end the cycle of anxiety It definitely wasn't drugs  we only had people round that we new well personally and trusted  Must've been an unexplainable reaction to alcohol like you said That was like reading my own thoughts  Well put OP  I feel you on that  Especially the idea of being dependent only on me and not having to meet others expectations  I do not feel unfulfilled single  Kinda annoying that very few people understand this though  People tend to think there is some unspoken and dark reason why I am not interested in a relationship  but it is pretty damn simple I know sometimes it feels like it damages ur morality makes you feel bad but if you try to improve yourself while still doing that it keeps you happy until you can one day be happy enough to stop doing it and be happy on your ownBecause you spoke of "overthinking" and "analysis paralysis " I suspect that what I posted on the thread "Someone help" on this sub reddit will be germane for you    With respect to meds  obsessional thinkers very often do better with low dose levels of  anti psychotics  https   www google com webhp sourceid chrome instant ion 1 espv 2 ie UTF 8 q neuroleptic 20medications   but it looks to me like many prescribers are not yet up to speed on that  and are still going with  supposedly  anxiolytic anti Ds like citalopram and escitalopram   benzodiazepines like clonazepam and lorazepam  That's too bad  because fractional dose quetiapine and lurazidone appear to work pretty well in such cases  and with minimal sfx I'm glad if I could show you other ways to protect yourslef than killing   I've always found older women incredibly alluring  Not sure why  Maybe it has something to do with me being a submissive little bitch Great  Even a criminal is seen as a better partner than me I don't fuckin know  You want me to look at my conversations with a microscope and determine scientifically the keywords and phrases I am missing  I don't think that's how you learn Sadistic  I'd ask you to explain but I'm still trying to figure out what sheep oil is  You say things that don't make sense  You also assume my partner is female  I will not fray  Whatever that means  There are definitely way more references to girlfriends and SO's on reddit than other family members or friends  I'm really sorry you're going through all that  While I'm not trans  and definitely can't understand everything you're going through  I know what it's like to hate your body and feel like you're unacceptable because of it  I went through years of hating my appearance  and myself because of it   and I still have bad days  but overall  things have gotten a lot better  They almost certainly will for you  too  you'll keep doing what you can to make yourself look the way you want to  but more important than that  you'll come to terms with how you look now  I've heard that even when physical changes are positive  which it sounds like those caused by hormones are for you    they're hard to adjust to and deal with  because we're creatures of habit and change is hard  Give it time  Allow yourself to adjust to your changing appearance    You sound like a super sweet person with a lot to contribute to the world  The fact that one of your reasons for sticking around is to spread happiness to others is frankly awesome  and I admire you for it  Your unwillingness to hate even those who hurt you is very mature  and I hope that you'll learn to extend that kindness to yourself  Good luck   do need to be near in hdtv  That does not make sense in English     I can tell you that everything is blurred due to upscaling   Your PS2 outputs standard def video  480i if using yellow white red plugs   the TV then tries to blow that up to 1080p  usually with poor results     There was a component video cable for PS2  red green blue white red  which can produce better results   Some PS2 games can use 480p output if you hold triangle and x while the game loads     You might be able to play with your HDTV's image settings to get it to more sharply define edges while scaling   That will help with the text     Finally there's a device called a scan converter which you can put between PS2 and HDTV and it does the upscaling in a much more game friendly manner   This is sort of a niche product tho   "omg guys look at my girlfriend she did this cool thing isn't she amazing   hey did i mention i have a girlfriend  "    Basically every mainstream reddit thread  Your partner might have neurological issues  Have they ever been tested OkayYou're the one who created sheep oil I'm kind of lost  Keep doing until I reach a point where I'm emotionally healthy enough to quit Although I have not been through exactly the same situation  I have been in the position of having to let go of someone I love for their own good    The fact that people are asking you to seek further "adult" advice is completely bizarre to me  considering this is not a trivial matter    You need to contact the police   You need to come to terms with the fact that although he has helped you through very difficult times  this is not something that can simply be pushed under the rug   If you truly love him  you will call the police   not for you but for him  He needs this   You will be fine  life will go on  and with the support of friends and family  you'll be able to move forward from this    Best of luck  Thank you for the warm and friendly wishes of caring support  It really does me so much to hear these things I prefer music that doesn't distract me from my thoughts  Video game soundtracks  smooth instrumental jazz  and classical music make up the lion's share of my music player What else do you want to do  There are only two options go out  talk with people and likely fail or stay in your room in safety but alone    Do some reading into how to socialize and then use those tips even if it seems weird to you  With time you will know what to say and what to do  Thats learning While I obviously don't know the details of your situation  you sound like a good friend  You helped this person as best you could for a child so young  and I admire you for that  my brain has adapted to this  must be 5 years now already since then  It's like  i can't long and wish for something that doesn't exist  amiright

listening to  Meltdown by Ash  https   www youtube com watch v yrx1b4gaxWs list PL696E82824A2D5388  Basically yeahI'm gonna go against the tide here  Talk to him about it  See what the fuck is up  Not to make it sound like you need to be excessively stern  but either he calls a therapist and keeps going or you call the cops  I'm assuming he didn't take those pictures  but in either case  a therapist will do much better for him than he cops  I will warn you that if he goes to jail  he will come out changed  Prisoners do not take kindly to child molesters and the like  That said  if he's not willing in to put the time and effort to change himself  he needs to be put somewhere where he doesn't pose a threat to youth  We're not really comparing ourselves to this guy and getting upset   We're upset because  despite being a criminal gang banger  this guy has done absolutely nothing to become very successful in life   Literally handed success solely for having aesthetic value from

Ive been in a similar situation as you when I was your age  Im 26 now   You are still young  and there is still so much that you can achieve  The fact that you wrote this post shows that you want to change  It sucks that these things happened to you  but you cant let those things define you as a person  If you really want to change  give yourself some time to really think about what you want to achieve  university  a job  gym etc  and then just work on that as hard as you can until you get to a point in your life where ur a bit happier than you are now  As for social things  you cant really control those  Just know that new people come into your life all the time  Dont worry about it too much   and just work on who you want to be every day  even if its just a bit   Good luck bro  you're

episode    Cheers  Thank you for your great advice it means alot  Years stuck in this situation take their toll There is no physical abuse but the  emotional causes a scary complacency   I used to be pretty resourceful and just have to quickly find that person again for my kids I went to school last year already suffering from depression and long time girlfriend cheated on me right when i got there  Was in the tank that year  Last semester was the final straw for the school so i got kicked out because of grades  At the time it was chemistry but before i left i changed it to history  I want to teach and help kids  However my mother and step father think i should be an elementary school teacher  So stuck at home and going to the local community college till i can go to another school  Also just feel empty from the loneliness and constant failures of SO searching  I try doing just me but ends up just being really lonely First  I wouldn't go by one person's perception   Frankly  she might simply be cowed by your size   Some women are   I'm not as large as you    6'  235    but there are definitely a couple of friends of my wife who had to get to know me  a lot  before they could relax   And I'm considered a perfect gentleman by some other women  edit  right off the bat  I always dress the same   Ask some other people besides this woman before you decide whether changing your look is a thing   Because some people just get upset over things that most others don't  things in their past lives  maybe  who knows   Baggage  anyway   Ah that makes a difference    It's proper etiquette to suspend judgment towards getting slapped by someone's death spasms until said spasms have subsided   They should be able to refer to counseling  usually  Too bad she won't agree to

have had their drinks drugged by people they knew well and trusted  One of my best friends had a guy she had known for three years  a guy she trusted completely  a guy who had met her parents  drug her drink and rape her while she was blacked out  The next morning he   completely sincerely   denied that it was rape and said that he just wanted her to "loosen up" and that she had consented     Maybe because you're a guy  you don't see this as a possibility  Maybe you do know better than I do  But as cynical and as shitty as it is  I think you should not dismiss the possibility that you drank something that was intended for someone else  It is not optional to choose to talk to an authority or not  It's necessary  If OP doesn't  they are an accomplice and will be seen as just as

a taste of what they meant by "went viral"   http   imgur com lLubOs9 I doubt you are reading this  I'm not doing well  The past few days I've been so overwhelmed with sadness and pain that I can't get myself off the floor  I just collapse and sob uncontrollably  I can't breathe  I wish I were dead  I don't know what to do  How difficult would it be to just have a mandatory question to answer  e g getting license  registering to vote  etc   that should capture the vast majority of the adult population so that we can be reasonably sure most folks have chosen instead of having to rely on a default option to get the result we want  Anyone can make friends my dude  especially in college  I will have to say that the way you dress and carry yourself can be way more important to get to know people  So if you want something that could help you immediately and is easier to do  try getting into fashion for a bit  New clothes  hair style  grooming and all that Maybe I'm looking at it incorrectly but from my point of view right now I think she doesnt think these counselling sessions are helping so she just doesnt go to them    she tends to give up very easily  on everything now  Not if you actually have problems remembering  If you're just a slow learner you'll get there eventually  Just focus on improving things one at a time until you're ready to begin quitting I'm trying the sameWell I've been doing that my whole life    and this post here is the result lol  And about texting  I am in different chat groups on discord and stuff like that and I talk there with no problem  I'm used to randomly talking with people on the internet  but the thing is    people that come on chat groups are usually there to talk to they respond fast and try to make conversation  They don't take as much time to answer as someone who's doing god knows what and responding to a message when they have time  How old are youI used to wonder what kind of weirdos did that  Now I totally get it  they do it to  stay married   A good night's sleep is just too important I truly don't know what you're going through and can only imagine how hurt you must be  Please know there is someone out here praying for you to find peace in this relationship  It was a trick he taught me  Okay  not too bad then   A couple things to keep in perspective     Your friend very likely could have been very busy  There's no reason to doubt that  Christmas is a bit of a hectic time  followed right after by new years  Lots of people travel or have commitments during that time  That being said  a quick response is not too much to ask for  It doesn't have to be prompt  He doesn't have to send you a response within an hour  But nothing within 2 weeks is a bit much  especially for you as someone who is trying to put themselves out on the line where you haven't in the past  This kind of lines up with my story I mentioned about my friend who wouldn't respond  It's okay if you're busy or you just don't want to do anything  but give me  some  response within a reasonable time frame  It could be that he was busy  didn't see it for a few hours  then by the time he saw it he figured it was too late and so he just ignored it  But going forward  you would appreciate a quick  "Hey  sorry  I've been caught up in something for the past few hours  Not gonna be able to hang today "    Your last sentence "If that's how it is  then they don't have the right to expect different from you " That's a very careful edge to walk on  In a relationship you should never tell someone what they can or cannot do  You can say  "From my perspective  it just irks me that you ask me to reach out  and now that I reach out you do the same thing as I was  If I'm going to reach out more  then I need you to reciprocate " You can say things from your perspective  but any time you word a message in a "you don't have the right to   " phrasing then that's too demanding and will rub people the wrong way  Whenever you confront someone  no one can get mad at you for how you feel or how you perceive things  But they can get mad when you tell them concretely how things are or what they should shouldn't do  Most often these types of things are simple miscommunications or disconnects that can be fixed  and there was never any ill intent  So telling someone "you don't have the right   " without first informing them of the problem and expressing how it makes you feel doesn't give them a chance to fix it  That being said  you can get the same message to them  but just keep it focused on "I" statements  Talk about what it looks like from your perspective and how it makes you feel  then you two can figure out an agreeable solution   Confrontation is a very healthy thing to do  but it's also very delicate since wording something the wrong way or taking something the wrong way can lead to an argument instead of problem solving If one was invalidated  insulted  rejected  disclaimed  criticized  judged  blamed

Grimes  Angelspit  Devin Townsend  Baby Metal  Moby Wasn't aware he's putting children in danger by looking at photos he could find online  minus the nudes   It's not like he's out raping and molesting them  She should seek mental help first for him  if by chance he is out actually harming children then yes  go with what you said  Tarnishing his name and ruining his life completely because he has a mental problem isn't worth it I would like to say I'm comfortable being single  but when I see a loving couple I can't help but feel envious  I was pretty insecure growing up  but every day I'm becoming more comfortable with myself  In the back of my mind I do feel a bit unloveable so that doesn't help anything  Here's to 2017  may we continue our personal growth Pretty much only metal  I try to avoid love songs like the plague Well stop fucking drinking then  Thanks for that  it sounds eerily familiar  She did have a bout of postpartum depression and a lot of our misundestandings stem from me not being able to read her mind  I'm naturally easy going and accept a lot for what it is  She sees problems and looks for a cause  Most of the time she can trace it back to me somehow  For example she was driving us all home one night and missed an exit  If I missed an exit  I leave it as I missed an exit  She asks me "and what were you doing" as if I was supposed to remind her  I had actually fallen asleep  which she didn't like either  Btw I didn't end up going snowboarding today  There really isn't much left to do around the house as I cleaned vacuumed and mopped over the weekend  but now I'm trying to read her mind as to what else she could have possibly wanted me to do around the house  I didn't enjoy the idea of spending the day at the mountain dreading what I have to come home to if there were anything to be done Yeah but do you intentionally and obviously flirt with them Yeah  I guess we're both kinda blunt  I am  when I do communicate  but I don't fare well with serious conversations because I start crying and then can't get my points across very well    This has been a thing for the past 2 years at least  I can't remember farther back  but there's nothing crazy going on or anything  Also  he waits till we're alone  That's pretty impressive you should be screaming that  Congrats  I feel like had I been acting in a way that might indicate being drugged  the paramedics would have noticed the signs  They were there for a very long time So that's what Godwin's Law looks like  Neat  As long as the dude ain't out taking the pictures videos himself and ain't put trying to get laid with a preteen then I say let him do his thing  you do yours  There's way worse people out there than him  Even if I didn't have a problem with people masturbating to images of children and young teenagers  which I happen to think is really fucked up and I do have a problem with   the biggest problem is that watching these videos and looking at these pictures 1  victimizes exploits children  2  puts children at great risk 3  potentially turns a pervert into a rapist   The only thing we know about this guy is that he has child pornography on his phone  We have no idea what else he may have done  How do you know he hasn't taken any nude suggestive photos of children  How do you know he hasn't molested or raped a child  Many child molesters have ruined countless number of kids' lives and continued to do so again and again  because no one said anything  Jerry Sandusky for one    I'm not saying that he's a rapist  But I do think that handling this one on one is a terrible idea Does he feel secure in his own masculinity  Sounds like a little bit of Walter White syndrome mixed with feelings of inferiority  As dumb as it may sound  teaching isn't always seen as a masculine profession  Do you make more money than him The thing is if you do something without ppl asking unfortunately its not obligated to say thank you  Most ppl with manners will but never expect anything at all for a good deed  The thing is you dont do good deads expecting anything  not even a thank you  Im a nice person but i learned long ago truly never expect anything in return So  from what you describe  I'm not sure sure this guy is a bully  He sounds more like a yuk yuk buddy who just doesn't know when to stop  Could be totally wrong about that   At any rate  I would suggest talking to him when you are on on one  Tell him the tit for tat thing was fun and all  but you're starting to hear co workers talking about it  and if word gets back to management it could suck for both of you  Because they stay inside and are bad at socializing and meeting other people   It's by no means impossible or even hard  But probably harder than usual to become friends with them because of the things I mentioned before I met my wife when we were in our late teens and I told her when I was attracted to other girls  which was always back then  We've been together for 32 years  have three kids  and are both very happy with our relationship  She is still working on getting me to not "overshare" my thoughts with her  I don't think that you should break up with him  it may last and be beautiful  He's been honest and open with you  No teenager you ever meet won't feel attractions  The important thing is to be sure that the one you're with doesn't act on those attractions  If he has some self control and you are important enough to him  he won't  I didn't I wasn't able to afford a house until I was 30  And even then I had to move from the Bay Area to Sacramento AND have help with my down payment    Don't give up  Home ownership at 24 is a pipe dream on one income but doable in a few years  We exist but in the real world we are few and far between   The only reason it seems like there are a lot of us is because we flock to this sub n m I forgot you guys are still in school  Me too  I mean seeing them have no interest in me  literally none of them  made me kinda feel like that   "why should I be interested in a kind that is not interested in me"  I just look at them and feel nothing  Dude   Print out what you wrote and say basically that  Everything you said is straight up the truth and loaded with nothing but care and concern for your boyfriend and his happiness   He switched to biochem and you supported him  He's not doing too hot right now  and these are still the foundation courses for the major  You just want him to be successful and in a major he enjoys  Ask if he truly wants to do this or if he would want to reconsider being a teacher again   I'd probably lead into the conversation by asking how he feels about the upcoming semester  Hopefully he'll be open about his concerns  I hope that after failing two more courses he's nervous or uneasy about it  and that can be a good platform to ask him if this is truly the right path  Ask if he really wants to go this way  or if he would be happier going the teaching route  You'll support him no matter what  but you see how much stress this is putting on him  the struggles he's going through  and the results  It's a fair question to ask if biochem just isn't a good fit and if teaching  or something else   would be a better fit   Ideally he should be able to take a step back from all of this and examine where his strengths are  and what he likes about this major  as well as where his weaknesses are and what he dislikes about this major  Since it hasn't been working out  let's take the things he likes and his strengths and find a major that fits better  It might be teaching  or it could be something else  Yes  it sucks to have to take a step back  but it's better to admit now that this is the wrong course for him versus waiting another semester or two and then changing  The longer he stays on the wrong path  the more backtracking he has to do  What is done with it should be MY decision   It still is  that's why your getting downvoted and insulted so much  You're intentionally being an idiot Wow  so your advice is to not even prep them   I mean  they probably know  but what if they don't    My advice is to casually say "you know I'm gay  right   I want to bring someone over"  Hell if I know  I'm bad at meeting people I agree  These thick minded humans obviously don't though  If he goes to prison over a few photos he'll come out completely changed  for the worst  if of course  he makes it out of there  It's better to get help and therapy for him than ruin his life  tarnish his name  and possibly get him killed   right  Now that being said  if the dude does have sexual adventures with kids then I do believe the cops should be certainly notified but he's not hurting anyone by viewing the photos  most you could literally get from google with a quick one word search Turn 18 in less than 10 days It's a general question  it's really not that hard to answer  as you have began to do  I didn't want to make it too specific to myself  I wanted to keep it general so that many people could benefit  Uhm  happy new years though   I guess I can try that  Thank you  That subs as depressing as it is  Feel like I got screwed over badly YeahNot being able to have kids sounds appealing to people who can't be bothered with children and not being a supermodel means you wouldn't be jetting off all over the world Pedophiles    Childlovers   Both two different terms  both two different definitions  The dude is hurting 0 children mentally and physically viewing photos  it's the sick bastards that take them photos   That being said  we don't know the full story  Maybe he took the photos himself but who really knows  I highly doubt he took them No ties and the worlds your oyster  go get um You guys just communicate affection differently  Unfortunately that means things are always going to feel unequal  Your guy might feel like he  is  putting in a lot of effort being affectionate  because in his eyes he is  Keep an eye out  he might be doing tiny subtle things for you but is too reserved to point them out to you   Don't feel ashamed about anything  keep being yourself  Has he explicitly said he dislikes the things you do  If he hasn't I'm betting he likes it  Maybe try telling him something like this  "I've been feeling insecure about our relationship lately  When I show you affection how much I love you  it doesn't seem like you reciprocate in the same way  I need to know that you care as much for me as I care about you  is there any way you could be more vocal physical to show me that you do " Hope everything works out for ya You must have just started datingI don't live anywhere near my parents anymore so they don't know much  My 13 y o sister said I must be hiding a girlfriend from her and my parents seem to think the same or that I am kind of a chad  Makes me feel even worse   Do you know that they were of many different families types  I wouldnt imagine they would be but on 14 of a similar type    As for my currect situation  I'm on 20 abilify  150 effexor and 300 wellbutrin  My doc is hesitant to put me on anything else  THere has been some success  but it has been limited  which is why I want to add something That guy doesn't even look that attractive to me  I'm really puzzled by his case  But good for him I guess be a dishwasherBut would he is the question They need to sit down and have an honest talk about it  Some "pedophiles" wouldn't go as far as touching a child  most just view  Locking up someone like him is a waste of tax dollars and space  we need the producers and distributors locked up look  I agree  but he needs help and that's where the focus should be at the moment  don't forget that there's also a reason why prison has a high rate of recidivism  if he can change through therapy  that'll be great  but prison shouldn't be the first option  imo  I'm sure I'm not the only person who's heard of innocent people doing time only to become criminals afterwards  I'm assuming he's not listed on your birth certificate      Could you ask any aunts or uncles  your brothers dad  or any old friends of your moms I'm 25 and for me  I want a younger GF  Mainly because I believe girls from 18 25 are the most attractive they will ever be  I'd even consider a 16 year old  that's legal here  but I think I would probably find her too immature  That's not to say women older than that are not attractive  they're just not as nice as they are during that 18 25 age bracket    I feel like no matter what age a girl is  it'll be hard for her to relate to me  I feel older women expect certain things that I can't deliver  They expect a certain level of maturity  career progression and life experiences that I don't have  People at my age begin to start settling down    For me younger girls are more beautiful  There is always a feeling that these girls can have anyone they want  So if I somehow end up with them then you have really achieved something  Also I missed out on being a teenager  I feel if I could have a teen GF I could somehow be part of that world and sort of experience it     These girls judge you on your age too though and I know they would view me similar to the older woman  although maybe not as harshly as they may not be looking for something as serious  I sometimes read stuff on AskReddit and I don't really know what people are talking about  It makes me realise that I probably wouldn't be able to relate to these younger girls If I was on a date with one  But then I guess I can't relate to many people outside of this sub  Most FA's like me don't even know what flirting really is or how to do it  I never even approached a girl so maybe that's why       "Uh    My boyfriend is gay "Yeah  lets escalate it to the extreme  If she really cared about him  or at least wanted to help the guy out without ruining his whole life  she'd seek some type of mental help  If that don't work  then involve the police  That being said  I'm sure a therapist would only call the cops but it's worth a try No logical person is going to say  "I can't reciprocate  I can't respond to your text hours later or within a day or two " This is 2017  People are glued to their phones  Whether I'm at work or at home  I'm looking at my phone at least every couple of hours  If he can't bother to send a quick one line text message out as a response then that's just being dishonest   I wouldn't say they "dictated" your relationship by asking you to put yourself out there more  That's a totally reasonable request  I mean  do you think it's fair that they should always be the ones to reach out and contact you to set things up  Setting things up can be tricky  and it's nice to not have to do it every time  If that's unreasonable from your end  then you can end the friendship  But odds are that's not an unreasonable request   Same thing here  Now that you're reaching out  it isn't fair that you reach out and get no response for weeks  when really all you're looking for is a quick  "Hey sorry  I was busy  Can't make it tonight " If that's an unreasonable request from his end  then he can end the friendship   In reality  neither his request or yours is unreasonable  But instead of just getting together and hashing this all out in a few minutes  you two are left sending 1 2 text messages which don't tell the full story  I would just leave it be for now and then talk about it a little more when you get together to iron it out  These things can sometimes be taken the wrong way via text instead of when you're talking in person Great post as always Sounds like something you should report to be honest  I don't know why you wouldn't  He's an adult and is responsible for his actions  Well you still have time to improveThank you so much  Happy new year to you as well How is life as a 40 year old FA  I haven't felt attraction to anyone for some time now  I am still a year short of 30  How do you pass time  There are times where I break down a little bit  and then my mood swings back to "normal"  Did you have that  If so  did it eventually die out You are overthinking it  ya goddam asshole    Maybe have small goals for social outings  like get one person to laugh sincerely    Just be more you  If you are an asshole  this is difficult to enjoy  But some people enjoy being an asshole  Some people enjoy being around assholes  Find the other asshole and talk some shit with them  Find the other person who totally doesn't have shit to say and see if you can get them to say some shit  That ones my favorite  especially when that persons friends are like whoa  he or she never talks this much  It really is fun to connect to people  Not every time  but you miss 100  of the shots you don't take  Also  if you match people's excitement or interest level  and understand their personal space   other social preferences   it is easier to create a connection    I've had some social breakthroughs after watching some Tony Robbins videos on youtube  Also has a documentary on netflix that is pretty interesting  I just feel more ok saying whatever recently and not overthinking shit  That dude knows how to interact and connect to people  Find out any the live in your country  pm them finding out more  hobbies etc  Whichever one hits closest to home try to meet in person  The decision was made for me  by the government  that unless I take action it's their body   Just because I have an out doesn't make it right   The government has laid claim on my organs and body   Period   I'm downvoted because no one understands what liberty means anymore and I'm intentionally fighting to maintain it   Reddit simply downvotes opinions they don't like  we both know it   It's  funny how a government opting everyone into a porn filter is an outrage but opting everyone into organ donation is the best thing ever   Libel and damages    If this lawyer isn't willing to pursue  seek another  This case has many indications of being an easy victory I think that's a great idea  and you should do it if you want to do it People like that are a minority of society but obviously since this is ForeverAlone there are bound to be a lot of them gathered here  There's also what Tortuga said  you're less likely to come across them in real life  You could try posting an ad in FADating  I'm sure you'll get tons of replies If she had a viable reason to not date you than you need to either fix that problem she's having or just pick your self off the ground and keep going ahaha I had a feeling someone would say something like this the title was really poorly phrased on my part  '   YEAH LETS RUIN HIS WHOLE LIFE  POSSIBLY HAVE HIM MURDERED AND WHILE WE'RE AT IT  TARNISH HIS FAMILIES NAME ALL OVER A COUPLE OF ILLEGAL PHOTOS  THE REST PERFECTLY LEGAL AND NON NUDE I hope so  Thanks for dealing with my rant or whatever  I'm just trying to get better before I just quit altogether  ThanksI sleep most of the dayWould law enforcement there consider placing harassment and trespassing charges on those girls   appreciate the links   i will check these out  lol at the thought of opening with some heavy hitting questions  good god  Maybe move my weights into the shower tooThanks  that's pretty solid advice to be honest  and I'm sure even though I can be a little awkward I could pull off saying that to them and making it sound natural   That's definitely true  It's also true that it is difficult to distinguish when someone has been slipped something in their drink  That's why it's so effective  Paramedics may have made the same assumption you did   you're a male  you're with friends  so without someone specifically asking for a blood test to determine you were drugged  they didn't ask    Again  you may be right  Nothing mave have been slipped in anyone's drink  I definitely am not the authority to decide that  I'm just saying    I've never heard of such a dramatic  intense reaction to alcohol when alcohol has never affected someone in that way before    I mean  is it really more likely that you had a wildly uncharacteristic reaction to booze than that you had a reaction to a drug you've never experienced before     I get why you're resistant to the possibility  You may be right  But just do me a favor  Google the search term "date rape drug violent reactions"  The very first result lists ketamine as a common date rape drug  The common side affects of ketamine are loss of memory  loss of coordination  and violent or aggressive actions     Just  maybe don't dismiss the possibility out of hand  The women in your social circle might be at risk    Edited to add  ketamine is legal and used on animals  Anyone there that day a vet  or a veterinary student  I know the feeling  hah  A lot of people see texting as an informal version of email  so they don't think of it like a real conversation  Dyou live close to any of your discord people  If so irl meetups might be a thing to do  The new year's post really dragged in all the normie trash from  r all Nah  fuck you  Also  your opinion is shit  That's my opinion  Problem  kid You seem like a really nice friend  that's awesome dude  But she was under the influence of something that heightens sexuality  oxytocin feelings of closeness and all that  I would definitely just talk to her first to see if she remembers and how she feels about it  If it seems like it was a mistake then just let it go  No need to tell the BF unless it happens again  Firstly  you have to consider the stigma that comes with being known as a male virgin  Most guys aren't going to walk around advertising the fact out of shame  It's entirely possible that you've been around them and just didn't know it   Secondly  from the stories I've read plus my own experience  past a certain age  guys that are virgins tend to be shut ins who only leave the house for work and shopping  making them even more difficult to find   Lastly  we tend to have issues with social situations  so it can be uncommon to see us work up the courage to actually initiate a conversation  especially with a woman I do feel unloveable whenever I see a couple holding hands walking together kissingI wouldn't say  in your case specifically  you're being selfish  You're not obligated by any means to initiate or sustain conversation with anyone that you don't want to partake in  You're probably just introverted and have more pressing matters on your mind  Nothing wrong with that  Don't let anyone tell you you're selfish because you don't care about what happened on The Bachelor last night   On the other hand  if someone's really putting a lot of trust in you to confide some issue that deserves a listening ear or a little input  the very best you can do is be up front and say  "Hey  I'm sorry  but this is pretty heavy for me and I'm not the person to be confiding this to "   Some people just don't want to talk and aren't big on conversation  no big deal    Now  regarding that quote in your titlewe get back what we put out to the world  That's about the only answer I can give to that  If you put out positivity  you'll get positivity back with a few outliers of assholes here and there  in which case  I personally try to be nice either way because getting negative back seems to just invite more negativity into the rest of my day    If you run into assholes all day  you're either living in an abusive household or workspace or you're probably projecting an energy that makes people think it's alright to unload their negativity on you  negativity met with negativity  where positivity is  predominantly met with positivity     Anyway  just my thoughts  Keep the peace and bacon grease You've lived together two years and this behaviour started in the past two years   Maybe something about living together is annoying him Great  thanks for your input  As long as the name doesn't sound ridiculous without my having realized it hahaIm going through a hard time too  But realize that a hard time doesn't mean a terrible life   If she cheated on you then all you can do is move on  Take your time to feel however you need to but make plans to move forward Does it really feel good being single for so long   You're being betrayed and hurt and put in danger by his decision to pursue illegal images   She's not being put in danger  It was also his decision because he's mentally sick  He needs help  Not to be locked up in a cell beaten and bruised possibly murdered over a couple of illegal images  We also don't know the whole story  Why were they there  Are we 100  sure it was him  Is this his first time being curious about it  Would he be a danger around children or would he just leave them be  They may be pedophiles but they do have self control  Most ain't going to go out and rape molest a bunch of children for the simple fact that they know they'll get caught  Whether it's a year down the road  or 10  they always get caught I stopped caring a long time ago what people might think of my romantic sexual experience  So I don't think it would matter a whole lot but sure  it would probably feel a bit better to know I wasn't as far behind when compared with others my age I know it's not  That's what I'm maybe thinking  I think it was my fault for even feeding into it  I think I said some stuff which made him feel insulted and this is his way of getting back  I would be normal  There wouldn't be shame or self doubt  That is just how things are  It would be easier to date too  as selfish as it may sound  You would know that you haven't been thrown out the gene pool  before you even try to find someone   Although  while Japan is witnessing men lost to solitude and withdrawal  aren't the women are just going for white guys Yes   We don't allow any relationship dating sex advice in this sub  So this is your official warning I'm literally at a loss for words after continuing to read this thread  The sheer amount of people that sympathize with pedophiles is outstanding  I have a degree in psychology so I fully understand that these individuals cannot control themselves and have a mental illness but that doesn't excuse their behavior        Yeah okay  Say what you will  but he is not directly harming children  He is adding to the pool of people who seek such content and is thus playing an extremely small role in increasing the demand for such content  which causes more of it to be created   Also  I dont know what you think turning him into the police so they can "track" the photos will do  Did you read the post  If you did you'll find that OP outlined 3 types of pictures she found on his phone  1  pictures of 8 11 in bikinis and cheerleading outfits  creepy as FUCK but not illegal  2  SELFIES of nude girls around the age of 13  illegal  and 6 year old girls in makeup  again creepy as FUCK but not illegal   The only actual child porn is of young girls taking naked photos of THEMSELVES    even 12 13 year olds sext these days  I'm absolutely NOT justifying ownership of such photos in anyway  Im just pointing out that they were self taken photos and there is no abuse or anything to track   It is fucked up to own CP  no arguing there  However I dont think it instantly makes you a horrible irredeemable person that should be given no second chances  I think it is pretty fucked up to turn someone in that has been loyal to you for years and helped you through hard times  OP should definitely talk to him first  and be there for him like he was to her  get him help  He saved her life from meth addiction  now it is time for her to at least warn him and get him help before he spirals down the wrong path  I think it is best for OP to end the relationship after doing this and either support him as a friend from there on out  or to cease contact  Best of luck OP  Happened to me in college  Got too far into the drug scene and got incredibly tired of the "who owes who" and how literally everything we did revolved around weed and other drugs  I ended up failing out  but im grateful I left  sometimes you gotta just remove toxic people from your life even if it means youll be alone at the moment  If its your senior year  then you must be going to college soon  only advice i can offer is to just have fun the rest of senior year and move on once you get out  Theres essentially no reason for you to communicate with these people once you get to college anyways  everyone will care about you a lot more than anyone you know from high school  Maybe just try a new sport or club or something to meet people with similar interests even if you may not have been friends before theres no reason you cant make some during senior year No offense  but you really should pay attention to politics  Political decisions affect your life so you should be careful about what you choose  and make sure your choices represent you  Not saying to make your life about politics  but to be aware about it when important decisions are being made You're not obligated to anyone but yourself  But know that consequences are needed to keep these things from happening again  This guy isn't nice and disregarded your no  He needed to be physically removed off of you and he wouldn't have stopped with just your protests  Had there not been other people there this would be an entirely different post  He should know that he can't get away with something like that Nobody there was a veterinary student  we're all at sixth form currently  The only people  afaik  that have used drugs in the past are myself and my girlfriend at parties  only cannabis   and two of my school friends  who themselves have only tried cannabis   Though they did try to obtain some MDMA recently but the dealer was busy   I just can't see how it would've happened or who would've done it You got it Hmm I see where you're coming from  and maybe I should prep them   I'm just worried saying something like that might steer the conversation into talking about my sexuality  rather than talking about my partnerI'm glad you're looking for a way out  My mom was in a very similar situation  we were hundreds of miles from any family  had to follow dad's rules or be punished  the dog was confined to a crate or chained outside in freezing weather  he kind of stole the car my mom drove while she was at choir practice to punish her for letting her sleep inside after surgery   It's not a good scene  Getting out of the situation will not only be better for your kids and yourself  but it might just help him to realize what he's doing too  My dad calmed down a lot after their divorce  Hopefully your husband can do the same Bro I'm black and almost every black chick I know love Asian men just go for it It's not that I didn't report it   The cops came and arrested him 20 minutes after it happened   Myself and the 7 other people who were there gave written statements   I just don't know if I want to go through with pressing charges     I don't exactly have money for a lawyer and I'm scared to have to go court   I have really bad social anxiety and on top of this I'm still in shock from what happened and what could have happened     Also   this could ruin this guys life   I really don't know what to do and I need to decide quickly   Congratulations  Seems like it was a great way to end 2016 Jesus you're dense      potentially turns a pervert into a rapist   I love me some redtube com I guess that means it could potentially turn me into a rapist   Correct     puts children at great risk  No it don't  He's looking at a still photograph that wasn't taken by him  He's not putting children at risk  the guy girl that actually took the photo put the child at risk     victimizes exploits children  Sure  the child was the victim and yes the photo exploits her him  That's the only thing that makes fucking sense in that whole comment  But 18  porn also do exploit women men  But not trying to go against that point cause I do agree the next question to be pondering is what would you do if he refuses therapy or the therapy isn't working  do you still toss him in the slammer  do you leave him be and just hope he never acts on it  this is definitely a tough spot to be in   sidenote  might be better not to seem like you're riding a high horse or antagonizing people you disagree with ala "thick minded humans " I can understand the sentiment  but  as I'm sure you can imagine  emotions are kinda running around with this kind of a topic  so you might be adding fuel to the fire instead of helping out your point  just a thought  lol  Well  both names do sound strangely similar  but I think that makes it kind of cool Wow  that's one lucky scum bag piece of shit human being For some reason I feel guilty even though I didn't do anything except drink on New Years   which is exactly what most 22 year olds were doing Saturday night     I don't know   I still can't believe that actually happened to be honest He could have some sort of anxiety or shyness problem that manifests itself in not being able to eat in front of people I'm thinking about just sending the link to his profile so she can have at it herself  I'll have to check if non users can see it though Is the feeling that I am enabling them  and about the dollars  it's not a big amount  but they could asked me first  now I feel like I cannot leave nothing valuable  I don't know about you guys but I have always been rejected by people I've tried to be friends with  All these rejections has  made my brain go from pro social to defensive when meeting new people  Every single encounter    I can't walk up to girls and say hi without a 3rd person introducing me  Cause my brain tells me that they will talk shit about me if I do it alone    Same with a bunch of random drunk guys at a party what if they think I'm a loser by just looking at me    Or a group of people  what if they all think I'm abit weird and freeze me out    I have no problem talking to people who i know has accepted me in someway  But if that's not the case  I'm always on the defensive  I don't take the initiative since I might get hurt doing so  I hate having my last few sets of feelings hurt    It's not about leaving the infamous comfort zone but rather the fact that my antisocial brain needs to be reprogrammed  "I am sorry  but I am fully committed at the moment to my current projects and can't take this on right now  especially on such short notice  All the best  furious pillows"  This would be my approach  You hint that you would  if you could   You provide a legitimate reason for not helping  which if there is push back you can always tell your manager that helping him would have resulted in you not delivering something vital and in your job  You underline the reasonableness of your position by highlighting the zero advance notice given  which if he pushes back either emphasizes their incompetence  since they can't do it without you  or demonstrates poor time management  All the best is my preferred generic closing why in the world would you feel guilty I'd bring up that they should  even though it will likely be taken as an insult  Any head trauma  recent or in the past  Another thing to look into is the possibility of a mental health disorder  Depression among other things can cause similar stuff Restraining orders  no contact order etc  They will clearly break the order and then get punished criminally  If shes completely addicted and wants to stop  she needs to go to inpatient detox and rehab  Her environment isnt changing at home so why would she  Something has to give and its better its her toxic environment than her life You had me until you said traditional relationship where you stay at home   What is the point of staying home if you don't have kids  That just seems like laziness to me Lol  this is stupid The Gazette  Girugamesh  Ayabie  SlipknotLynch  Metallica  Death Grips  and some jazz She didn't  Shit just started falling apart  And still falling apart  I killed everything that could make this year something good  Adding fuel to the fire seems to be my thing lately lol  But yeah that's touchy then  After being caught  if he still proceeds downloading photos and videos  or gets worse  then that's 100  a red flag to report him  Getting caught doing something that highly illegal would be enough to make your heart explode  I'm sure he wouldn't even attempt to search for that shit again  or he could just be cocky and be more careful not to get caught lol  Child pornography has always been a touchy subject for me  On one hand  I think it should be very very illegal because of all the helpless children it destroys  but on the other hand I find someplace in my heart to have sympathy for the pedophiles because it's pretty clear either something happened in their childhood  or they just took a wrong turn  They just need mental help  the amount varies form person to person  For all we know OP's husband could of been sexually abused as a kid himself and just never wanted to talk about it or bring it up from the flaming depths of hell Well it seems like something needs to be done about it  Seems like it would've escalated to full on rape if that dude didn't intervene  Won't the court appoint a lawyer if you can't afford one It's never too late to reinvent yourself  What is the worst that could happen  They don't like the real you  How does that hurt you  Why do they have to like you      Congrats on free collegeIt depends WHY her parents don't believe it's real   If they're likely to listen to science  there have been studies done where the MRI of depressed or anxious people doesn't look like the MRI of someone without depression anxiety   As a side note  if your friend is suicidal  especially if she has made plans or anything like that  she needs help ASAP  Even if it means going to the hospital Do it  I'm not sure where you are  but changing your Name in the UK is so easy  With how backwards we generally are law wise  I'd imagine its even easier elsewhere  Good luck Well most of the people I'm around I see a lot   In a nutshell  it's a personal choice  If you feel like doing it  then do it  Everyone else can get used to it   Here's my perspective     Initials shouldn't be a big deal  Even crazy initials like FUK or ASS aren't a big deal  It's just something for people to laugh at every now and then  but then you just shrug and move on  Maybe kids made a big deal of it in school  but by now no one should care all that much  Even without a middle name  how bad can your first and last name initials be  The worst 2 letter combo I can think of is FU  but even then  who really cares  I'm curious now  do you mind sharing what your initials are     I gotta say  there's a bit of irony with wanting to represent both ethnicities of your family by adding "Whited" of all words to "Nguyen"  Surely you can see the poetry in that        Are you female  If you're female  are you planning on taking your husband's name anyway when you get married  My wife is from China  and I guess they don't really do that over there  so if that's your case I would understand wanting to make sure you change your name and are able to rep both your families for the rest of your life  Then if you have kids  are you fine with them just taking your husband's surname      Are you male  If so  then what do you expect of your future wife  Do you want her to adopt that hyphenated name  Would you be okay with her keeping her maiden name  What do you envision for your kids  Let's say you marry someone with the last name Johnson  Surely you can't expect them to take on the name "Nguyen Whited Johnson" to represent both sides of their family  And isn't it a bit odd for them to rep both sides of their father's family but no sides of their mother's     Are you okay with dealing with the hassle from a hyphenated name  It won't fit in a lot of forms  People will probably just say "Nguyen" instead of bothering to say the full "Nguyen Whited" anyway  In fact  given that "Whited" sounds like you're "Whiting" an Asian name  it might make a few people uncomfortable to say the whole thing  Nobody outside of you and your mom is going to get any satisfaction out of this  and it's going to be a bit more of a hassle for everyone else and for you too   All that being said  if it's important to you  then by all means  go for it  A hyphenated name is not the worst thing in the world for people to deal with  Considering you feel strong enough about this to go through with it  then your feelings trump any minor inconvenience anyone else feels  Although I think it's worth thinking about your future husband wife's name and what surname you'll give your kids   Personally  I have my dad's surname of course  I married my wife who kept her original surname  Now we just had our first child a month ago who has only my surname  It's a little weird at first  but it's not anything I really give any thought to or worry about  Since we are a multi ethnic family  I guess I wouldn't have any issue if she wanted to add my wife's last name to hers eventually  but I'll leave that for her if she actually wants to  I don't really give two shits about surnames  Most people only call me by my first name anyway  and my last name is just a way to distinguish if they happen to know someone else who also has my first name   In terms of timing  I suppose I would do it before you graduate so your high school diploma can have your new hyphenated name  Other than that  I don't see any rush to get it done before 18  You can always have a new passport  birth certificate  or driver's license created  But they'll only issue you your one diploma  so it's kind of nice to make sure that has the correct name Cheers dude  I think I probably will mention it to her  yeah mdma makes people very lovey dovey I'm pretty indifferent about age  I'm old though  and so would be wary about dating someone younger  say  25 or lower   Society is obsessed with age and frowns upon makes a bunch of judgments when there's a 10  year gap   Also before 25 people are still growing up changing  Throughout my life I've met a number of people who were like me  but somewhere between 20   30 became completely different people  It would suck to finally meet someone cool only to have them "grow up" and drift apart  I feel like at 30  people are kind of set in who they are  so there's a better chance of a long term  stable thing if I can  could  ever    as if  find someone in my own age group You're making this correlation between drug users and someone who drugs a drink that I don't think is fair  Plenty of people do drugs without slipping them into drinks  My point has absolutely nothing to do with who does and doesn't use drugs    Anyway  besides that  I take your word for it  Just suggesting it may be wise to be aware  keep an eye on your women friends when everyone's out drinking  If this happens to someone else  you'd know more   if not  that's a good thing of course I can't really speak for everybody  but I find bald men extremely attractive  And 5 foot 6 doesn't really matter either   Those who matter don't mind  those who mind don't matter  Hahaahah  Face my anxietiesYeah  it's annoying  I talk and treat messaging as a real life conversation  maybe that's why I'm so annoyed with messaging when I come across people that treat it like email hm     And no  in those groups from discord  the people I talk with are not even from the same country  I'm talking in english on those groups  So basically meetups are more likely not gonna happen Have you talked to a doctor about it    Next time you want to start something or a project  When you get that rush of something new  just stop  Don't start  Deny that instant gratification  Stop the cycle at the beginning and just focus on researching the process of the project and don't start it until you have thought through the process from beginning to end  If you are still interested after doing that  then try the project  if not move on  Continually step out of your comfort zone and test yourself  You give up when you either think you could do it if your tired  or if that's just the lie you tell yourself to save your pride the risk of failure  Do you really think you can do these projects  Or is it just safer to continually delude yourself into thinking you can by not finishing them  Congrats on a job well done  OP So you would probably have no problem with a child molester living next to you and your kids if he's good looking  right  Anyone who has a problem with that must be a jelly hater  right I don't know   I guess I'm too empathetic   I was just going to drop the charges but then I found out he wouldn't get fined or anything if I do   and I don't want him to just get away with it   This is why I'm so torn   I don't know if he'll learn his lesson unless I press charges but if I do it may potentially ruin his life   He'll be considered a sex offender for at least the next 15 years You can't please everyone in life  There will be people who will judge you and not like you no matter how much a mask you wear  It's a lot less stressful to just be you and not try to compartmentalize your personality so much  Hi  fellow Singaporean  First of all  I agree that you're still young  and your life is only just beginning  I know education and results are highly regarded  but it isn't everything  Maybe you feel kind of lost  and regretful about your past  but there's nothing you can change there  Don't give up on getting into your dream course    Humans are all a work in progress  You can get better  and get worse  Nothing is constant  and I think as long as you keep searching for it  your meaning of life will present itself to you in various ways  through new experiences  new people you'll come across    Our thoughts can be really overpowering sometimes  If you don't mind  could you share what your goals are in life  It's not easy to keep a positive mind  but if you go into something already believing that you'll fail at it  I think you'll severely reduce your chances of success  since you go into an attempt believing you'll fail from the start    Sometimes your goals can seem so far away  but if you break it down into smaller  less intimidating goals  small steps that you can take  you'll still get there    I'm sorry  I know this is all easier said than done  I struggle with the same feelings of dejection  But I'd made a mistake  and still continue to do so  I gave up trying  and that's where nothing gets better    Negative thinking and self hatred will never help us progress and only hold us back  It's hard  but you've got to try to learn to love yourself  and accept your faults  be kind to yourself and give yourself time to see your efforts pay off   I can't do this either  but I know if I could  things would be different     Is there anything that you currently find enjoyment in  Sometimes it doesn't have to be anything major  The smallest things in life can be enjoyable as well  and sometimes that's all we need to get by    As for keeping in touch with old friends  that's hard  because everyone moves on through different phases of life  Some people do keep in touch  and if you've tried  then perhaps it's not you but your mates that may be less interested in doing so  There are always new friends to be made though   Sorry for my quite useless comment  If you wanna talk anytime  hit me up Do you at least collect disability or something If it's that big of a headache  I'd just find a friend who you gel with more  I've got 5 very close friends that I've been friends with ever since high school or college  10 20 years ago depending on the person   I never got into it with any of them  I told you about my one friend who didn't respond to things  Once we worked it out  everything was fine  One of my friends was always a bit too judgmental when we stepped out of our shells or tried new things  so we confronted him about that and he toned it way down  One of my friends would dirty up every dish we had and never washed them  We didn't really resolve that one  other than deciding we can still be friends  but we just can't live together      All these things should be able to be worked out  This whole back and forth about someone texting someone back is such a minor problem in the grand scheme of things  You guys should be able to sit down together and hash this whole thing out in 5 10 minutes  set clear expectations  and move forward without any more problems  If you can't  then find a friend who is more reasonable She's just shallow as fuck  Sex is not everything you'll find someoneYeah  It's just hard to "reinvent" myself  I guess Yep  she released an album in 2008 and in 2009 she released an other album in collaboration with Pete Yorn  Here's her  Spotify page  https   open spotify com artist 2KAaJOwfu8n93byx6YPRPa  I saw you in another thread  you seem like a troll or some mental case or something    Either way  I doubt you're that special  You can't get dick because you're probably a narcissistic asshole who likes to be the black cloud looming over every discussion online or offline  Or at the very least not as beautiful smart or talented as you'd like to think  But whatever helps you sleep at night  honey  not like I'll ever know or really care after I hit the send button Come up with a plan together  As u panic bread said  she doesn't need his permission  just a plan to get out  She writes him a clear  decisive note or sits him down and has a forthright conversation  you can be here for this if she needs support   She says things like 'this is what I am doing'  Doesn't ask  simple informs him of her decision  Help her move  give her a couch to crash on for a while if you can    After that  encourage minimal contact between them  It will be a big change for her and the attraction to return to the familiar will be strong  He will also attempt to manipulate the situation  so aim to prevent that as much as possible  Keep her company  keep her busy and encourage her to do stuff without him  This will probably be hard at first  but keep at it    Good luckInstead of saying "I'll never drink again" try setting a definite limit  say 2 beers or 1 glass of wine or 1 mixed drink  Have a friend stop you if you want more  and always have non alcoholic options available in social situations  Counseling is definitely a good thing    When you saw him go to shave his head  if seems like you wanted to stop him from doing something he'd regret in the morning  When he said no  it probably felt like he was telling you that your opinions  in this case  on his appearance  don't matter  which your drunk mind blew up into "he doesn't care what I think ever at all in general"  which triggered the overreaction  Why you went upstairs and did the slit your throats thing I have no theories on  Has anybody told you what happened during the times you weren't there  you can't remember  Knowing that might help you figure out where to go from here Lol at everyone downvoting because they're jealous of the attention you'll get xD Dont try to destroy all of his life for this reason  Thats a hotfix to the problem  many see that hotfix as good enough however   Help him not deal any damage by acting on these preferences  welcome to earth  https   youtu be GibiNy4d4gc You're 18  Got your whole life ahead of you  Do some soul searching  Rather than complying with his needs and wants  find out what makes you happy and your interests  Then expand your social circle based on your strengths   Good thing about breaking up on New year's is that you have 364 more days of the year to make it the best ever   You're still young  Enjoy what life gives you and dont measure your happiness on how well you make others happy Yep  You're me  minus the doctor's visits and the couch surfing  I got nothing for either of us   s oolala Imagine doing it the other way around  If it was possible to send a message or influence your younger self in some way  What would you tell show your younger self    Would you try and take steps to improve your current situation or would you deliver a caveat For the record   The original article title did say "mandatory" which I used word for word  The article title has changed since  For articles like this I don't editorialize the title  Brutally honest is good  and thank you for this       This is exactly what I was thinking for her reasoning for sending it  I'm thinking she's doing it for "old time's sake" or something like that  Which is fine  but I'm not going to go just for old time's sake  If this was someone I talked to a bit more often  not just when we go out to dinner or something  I might feel different  As it is      I asked our mutual friend if she's going  and she said she probably is  Personally  I have no idea why  she doesn't talk to her much more than I do  But whatever  to each their own  listed Maine twice  If you swallow his cum you eliminate any possible but extremely unlikely scenarios    you might not like the taste but you can guarantee it won't get you pregnant  You can have a drink ready just in case   Giving a blowjob with a condom on isn't going to be as good for him as without AND you could be left with a nasty taste in your mouth  even with the flavoured ones  before he has cum  If a person trusts their SO and know they are clean  both hygienically and free from STDs  IMO a condom for oral is overkill  unnecessary and likely to spoil the event  Of course  I can also say  if he put his penis away post sex it would prevent you being paranoid afterwards    It isn't good for your health to keep taking plan b  YMMV  It isn't intended as a backup option for post event contraception  Taking the pill will be a better option   assuming you don't have significant side effects   if you do  change the brand  Do note that they advise you to take the pill before it can be consider effective  2 5 weeks usually    i e  you cannot just take the pill a couple of days before having unprotected sex and expect it to prevent a pregnancy  I dunno if a relapse is really enough to throw someone in the slammer either  changes takes time  how many people do we know that get caught with weed and keep doing it  how about graffiti  all of these kinda offenses become part of your lifestyle  and that can be hard to change  taking time and persistence  this is obviously a guilty pleasure of his and I don't see him not dipping back into it  even with therapy  but yeah  mental help first   might be good to ask what the law would do about it  esp if he's just looked at pictures  is that considered punishable under the law or is it just if he's acted out on it  does it put him on a registry Complete the course  Think long term  The benefits outweigh the costs Well that's unfortunate  I'm sorry about your situation  But someone who doesn't contribute at all is basically a no starter for someone like me who doesn't make much money in the first place  Maybe you'll find your sugar daddy somewhere Your permissiveness is absolutely astounding  and even more so after reading through your comments  I don't really care if you or anyone else likes my opinion on this  It's illegal for a reason  as well as morally abhorrent  It's child porn  plain and simple  so go ahead and dismiss it as no big deal   Thank you so much  That's exactly my reasoning for not wanting to go    why waste money for someone who doesn't really want to be there    Also  I'm going to be a maid of honor at my best friend's wedding in the fall  and it's out of state  a state next to me  but out of state nonetheless    This wedding would be right around that one  I think   While I could afford to be in her wedding and go to this one  I'd rather not waste money on this one  We'll see what I decide  but right now I'm thinking I won't go I too think of possible conversions  But more often than not when I have something interesting or cool to say in a certain moment  that subject never comes up or the moment never arises  Girlfriends are only a good thing if your hot  otherwise they'll probably cheat on you  Yeah if they did take it they were taking advantage of your generosity of allowing them into your home  I totally understand not wanting to enable them  Some people will just keep taking and you have to cut them off I guess that would make sense looking at my childhood Very true  And sadly I'm sure he would get put on the registry  I say sadly because he never physically touched children  If you piss in public you could be slapped on the registry so Depends on how old you   your "girlfriend" are Sorry  having trouble framing your story here     She's your girlfriend now  right  You called her by her best friend's name by accident  and now she won't talk to you  Now you're all back at her best friend's house and you're out on a walk because you're mad  Is that right  Just want to make sure I'm on the right track before diving in   Clearly this should not be a big deal  and that's why you're upset  right  You said the wrong name  but it's not because you wish you were dating her best friend  you just garbled the names up  You tried to explain that but she's not listening to you and she still won't talk to you  but your friends are trying to play it off as a joke  If she's still not talking to you  then it seems like she really is mad at you  which in my opinion is asinine    If I'm in your shoes  I would go back  ask the friends to give you the room for a couple minutes  then talk to her 1 on 1  Ask her to talk to you  If she won't talk  then tell her "It's pretty clear you're upset with me and don't want to talk to me  so I'll give you some space  Give me a call when you're ready to talk "  If she's the type of girl who just shuts down like this when she gets mad  then that's someone I would not want to deal with  I had a girlfriend in the past who shut down when she was mad and wouldn't ever try to communicate or clear things up  She would take something the wrong way  and then completely blow up and leave in a huff  After some time she would calm down and then we would talk again as if nothing ever happened   Shutting down is not how you deal with anger or issues in a relationship  You need to be able to talk to your partner  If you're too mad to talk  then you should do like you did and go take a walk or get some space until you're calmed down and ready to talk  If she's not willing to do that  then you've got your work cut out for you mate  You not only have to deal with whatever BS she's mad about right now  but you also have to teach her how to properly communicate her feelings when she's mad  That's a tall order and is going to take time and pain to work through   Sometimes there's nothing you can do right now in that moment to calm her down other than give her space  So see if after your walk she's calmed down enough that you two can hash things out  If not  then give her some more space until she's ready to talk Ah  that's too bad  The last bit of advice I have is you could move  but that's a huge and expensive commitment with uncertain results  Sometimes you just run dry on the dating pool  and have to have a change of scenery so you can be the sexy foreigner out of towner  Bonus points if your accent is different   I give horrible advice pls forgive me contact the youtuberI'm in the same boat  my dog is 14 diabetic  blind and deaf  She and I have been attached at the hip since we got her when I was a kid  Just make the pets life as comfortable as possible and make it feel loved  I've already accepted that my dog will probably die soon  and I'm okay with it  I'm not sure how to help someone else accept it but just try to stay strong for the pet  family means more to a pet than one would thinkI guess you would just delete that reminder post Because consent is assumed until you make an active declaration It's a comment under someone's post   Just think of what could have happened if your friend had not stepped in or if they had misconstrued what was going on  and thought it was consensual   He was just fine with potentially ruining your life  He may have learned his lesson  but maybe he didn't and you could be saving someone else who might not have someone there to stop him I moved to The US a couple of years ago and I don't have a degree  It's hard and you need a company sponsoring you to come here or need to marry a US citizen  Without a degree it will be hard as they look for immigrants with certain skillets they lack  The other visa options are the entrepreneur visa   120k savings needed annually  or person of extraordinary ability ie best in the world within your field   You can stay here for 3 months after completing an ESTA however you wont get work as you can't get a social security number without a visa and without social security you can't do anything no bank  pay bills  etc   There are many places round the world which will be easier to get into than the US and right now unless you are in STEM fields  science  maths  etc  the hiring market isn't that strong  Good question  You see  the other 3 still have the stink of your mom's pussy on them  The dry cleaners said they have tried everything they can't get it out  I was going to donate them to charity but have strict rules regarding bio hazardous materials  I'm going to have to dish out another 2 bills for another one after my date with your mom on thursday  The sex is worth it though  Sweet thanks  I thought I just needed someone else to look at itJesus that's tough  I'd grab evidence  pictures of the wall and the bruises on your girlfriend  and take it to the chief of police  With consent from your girlfriend  she might have to be there as well So if OP walked in on her boyfriend making out with a 13 year old would you make excuses for him then  too  Or are you only supportive of breaking the law when  you  judge that there's no victims    It's very likely that the 2 illegal ones aren't the  only  ones he's sought out  They're just the ones that are currently saves to his phone    He needs help  But a lot programs will turn him away because one of the rules is they will only accept you  if you haven't acted on your urges   He has acted  He has actively broken the law   Would you say that slave owners 300 years ago weren't contributing to the demand for slaves  After all  one man doesn't make the entire economy  But he does contribute  OP's boyfriend is actively contributing knowing that he is most likely helping to harm children  He's not a child unaware that his actions have consequences  He's a full grown adult  Has he helped OP  Yes  Does that redeem him somehow  No  OP wasn't going around collecting pictures of children    I find it highly disturbing that you're so willing to shrug off a man violating pictures of innocent little girls  How would you feel if you posted a picture of your daughter in a cheerleaders outfit and then found out some creep jacked off to it  How would you feel if  you  were the kid   As to the girls who took photos of themselves  children are vulnerable and easily groomed  It is not difficult at all for older men or women to pay "special attention" to children and manipulate them into taking such photos  Those girls may not be being whipped or starved  but they shouldn't be ignored because there "might not be" abuse wtf  "Oh well  they took the pictures without anyone else in the room  Clearly it's a healthy thing and I shouldn't bother looking too closely "  Also OP owes her boyfriend nothing  He chose of his own free will to help her  Quite possibly to get to this exact situation  I e  "if she ever finds out  she'll never betray me"  I felt like this for a long time until I started working out  I do not take antidepressants or anti anxiety pills anymore because they made my "feelings vacuum" worse  But since i began working out in March 2015  I have felt tons better  And the added bonus of being healthier has helped with having a positive outlook  I agree that the best thing she can do is forgive and move on   However  forgiveness isn't easy   it's not a switch one can push   This is especially true when those you wish to forgive may not admit to what they have done or show remorse       So yes  forgiveness is healthy and right   But one step at a time   The OP should focus on herself   on healing and on finding happiness   and if not actually forgiving her parents  at least trying not to hate them   and trying not to dwell on all they did wrong         So my advice  look forward  not back   Look for reasons for joy  not reasons for anger   Ignore your mother's request to contact him   unless it is something you need   Good luck and hugs for the new year I'm not saying it's no big deal  And your opinion is your opinion just as much as what mine is  Yes  it's very illegal for a reason  I agree with it being illegal  If it wasn't they'd be selling it on the side of the streets  on magazine racks  just like they used to  I'm saying his case isn't so severe  It could be worse  He could be out physically harming children  then he needs jail time  It's pointless to try and lock her husband up because it's only eating away at our tax dollars and leaving less room in prisons for the real rapists  molesters  murderers  etc  It's like throwing a drug user in a prison  They don't need to learn a hard lesson  the need help  Prison is    far    from help  even though it's suppose to rehabilitate the inmates  all it really does is turns them into bigger and worse threats to society  Et al with a link sounds good  making sure to use the first author and et al  It gives due credit to all  without changing orders of authorship  yep  even for streaking or peeing in public the side of the road  Judging by your grammar  you're not American  So  I'll give you some information on American law  whether you agree or disagree with them  I don't give a shit  It's a not a gray area that you think it is  The US laws are very strict about child pronography  According to United states Department of Justice    Images of child pornography are not protected under First Amendment rights  and are illegal contraband under federal law  Section 2256 of Title 18  United States Code  defines child pornography as any visual depiction of sexually explicit conduct involving a minor  someone under 18 years of age    Visual depictions include photographs  videos  digital or computer generated images indistinguishable from an actual minor  and images created  adapted  or modified  but appear to depict an identifiable  actual minor   Undeveloped film  undeveloped videotape  and electronically stored data that can be converted into a visual image of child pornography are also deemed illegal visual depictions under federal law    I'll let you read the rest  https   www justice gov criminal ceos citizens guide us federal law child pornography   Whether we agree or disagree to causation of pedophilia  the law is the law concerning child pornography in the United States  You can't compare it to drugs  because drug use is a victimless crime and child pornography is not a victimless crime   That is all I have to say  Good day  sir Heh  This sounds a little like my relationship  Heh  Heh  O OThe thing is she was my friend first and foremost and I haven't made it official with her  even though she's been pushing me to do so  She would help me out with my ex when I was having problems  My ex was the one who broke up with me  I never loved someone as much as her so I was devastated and hurt but I think she regrets her decision  My friend was there giving me support    and I starting spending more time with her  But I don't know if I love her as much as my ex  so should I go for the one I love or go for the one that really loves me  This is due to the fact that many people spend a significant portion of their time with their SO and do activities with them so them being included in the story is a natural consequence    I don't think it has anything to do with social signaling or trying to boost their ego I think it's fantastically rude of OP to walk into a group of 20 000 people and expect those people to do work that OP could have done   If OP wants an answer to their question from one of these 20 000 unpaid volunteers the very least they should do is not ask a fucking stupid question   HTH HAND Your boyfriend is no longer your main priority  If you want to keep the child  which is is totally your choice   then you need to concern yourself with your child  Your boyfriend needs to step up and support whatever decision you make  Anyone who thinks their life is ruined by fathering a child has no business having sex  No one's talked to me about the whole incident  This group of friends was mainly all of the guys who are friends and their girlfriends  so I'm not super close with any of them  We hang out regularly  or used to now  I guess  but always as a group  never one on one  if that makes sense   In the morning  people seemed to be in good spirits and I did have a couple short  meaningless conversations with a couple of people but no one really talked about the night before  So I'm just waiting on my boyfriend to call me now so I can get help with the blank spots in my memory and hear his side of the story Just break up with him  let him see what he's missing  I'll bet those feelings suddenly come back again  and if not  so what  Plenty more  eh I'm a troll for loving myself   And actually  being awkward is my only problem  My cousin says I reject every guy that talks to me because I don't even know they're flirting until they walk away and she tells me xD   And if you didn't care you wouldn't even be replying to me  so don't tell that lie Yeah  You lay on your back  if you have a life vest it's easier for balance  and just curl to legs up I am so sorry for your loss    I am certain he knew how much he meant to you  and that he felt appreciated in your relationship   Be kind to yourself  What  In  The  Actual  Fuck I am working on improving my life lol   it takes many years of perseverence   I added to the conversation on this thread because of some bullshit that happened in the world and now i cant complain about it   Lol so any injustice or any inequality in this world we're supposed to just be complacent   Theres 24 hours in a day i think i can take a few minutes to call out bullshit when i see it  I'm not saying it's no big deal   Yes you are    It could be worse  He could be out physically harming children  He is harming children now by downloading those pictures and whether you believe it or not  physically harming children is most likely right down the road   Most people going through a university course really feel like dropping it at some point  and it must be daunting having so much study time left  The decision to leave is ultimately yours  but I think you need to think primarily about how much time you are going to save  short or long term  Whether it's time you can save having those years ahead of you cleared up  despite having wasted 2 years  and now be confident you can have a good career without the degree  or have no time in the future because you have not gotten the degree and theoretically get paid less   You can hardly get a job anywhere without a certification today either  If you distinctly want to do something else  then getting out of your current course could go quite well   You don't necessarily need to do the degree cold turkey either  Explore options for breaks in study or other compromises   I really tried to keep it open  but I think you should stick to it  It will show dedication  if nothing else  And 7 years later  can you imagine the feeling of finishing No I'm Canadian  Much like you American's  pedophiles also get beat in prisons here to      because drug use is a victimless crime  PLEASE  Yeah cause when my father was a crack head beating the whole household cause he couldn't get his fix we weren't victims  Drug abuse VERY MUCH SO victimizes the people around the user  You really don't have to tell me about drug use  I was surrounded by it for 18 straight years and was scarred mentally because of it So if women aren't people are they aliens That's DEFINITELY the reason why you're being downvoted  Don't you know everyone here is a raging misogynist who hates women Yeah  but you should be able to delete any post of yours  Doesn't matter where what it is  Doesn't matter if I replied to the post like I did '7 minutes ago' or am replying to you now    If you can't delete it then  I'm just clueless on what you should do  Sorry man  Do you use Reddit Enhancement Suite  Try that Has anyone asked what your grandma wants  Is she fully aware of what is happening in this situation   the descriptions of how sex was sounded so much hotter and organic   Exactly I would love to give it a go  Nothing beats taboo sex man Black metal  dungeon synth  This album is the best one ever https   www youtube com watch v 8f06FcM6lJkA big red flag here is that you say you essentially change yourself for them  to "adhere to their lives"    That's not mature or healthy  Don't do that  Just be you  and if he's worth your time he'll love you for who you are and not who you pretend to be for him  It's not possible for someone to love someone else when they don't know who that person really is  He's not harming the children  Them children got no idea that he has those photos  The one that was harming the child was the one who took them photos  And no  I'm not saying that it's no big deal  Of course it's a big deal  Without help he'll continue doing what he's doing  Not saying that he will ever go to the extreme as to actually touch a child  But getting thrown into handcuffs and beaten by inmates is not help  he'll only carry on doing it once he gets released  if he gets locked up at all You should watch  the documentary  you will change your mindThis is so emotional to read  as I have gone through a couple of heartbreaking breakups through time  Thanks for sharing  I wish you all the best and I want to say that nobody deserves to be cheated on  I am sorry this has happened to you  Time heals All hangouts are always both  if you end up together it was the romantic first date  if you don't it was hanging out with friends   Romance is something in hindsight so go in with the mindset as hanging out Virginity is a stupid concept anyways  PIV intercourse doesn't have to equate to sex  Sex is more than just that    Do you feel happy with your decision Not anymore  You either keep her as a fwb or risk it and ask her out  It's all on you people are meanIf abortion isn't an option  then you have no choice but to tell him   If you feel like he'll stay in the relationship out of obligation  don't let him  It does take too   Tell him he can be involved with his child as much as he wants  but a relationship between the two of you isn't necessary   I've done it alone and with a spouse   Alone isn't bad as you imagine  In some ways  even easier   Good luck and best wishes Well Costa Rica is amazing  It has everything like volcanos  hot springs  rain forests  cloud forests  Atlantic beaches  Pacific beaches  caves  rivers  valleys mountains  fauna  flora  It takes a good while to see it all Depends where he lives  If it's a small town  chief and him might be buddy buddy and fuck over op As many have said get him to the vet  If he has recently had surgery there's a good chance it's related however it may not be search for websites that review local prostitutes  and see if they have non pros sections  or dig through the pagesYet  a man has to contribute money  or else he's utterly worthless   Quite the double standard They are interested in you because you sent them nudes and they are teenage boys  Just ignore them  what they think of you doesn't matter  You might want to consider cutting back on the drinking if this is how you act when drunk  to protect yourself  because you don't know if one guy might decide to use the pictures against you when you don't give into him later on  Especially if you are in the US because I'm pretty sure it would be classified as child pornography  Hey I wrote a post about this  it is directed at partners  but could be helpful here too  https   kylarosesims wordpress com 2016 11 23 when your partner has anxiety 8 tips for getting help   I didn't have insurance either and now I use a digital therapist because I live in a place where I don't speak the language and the waits for help are long  Let me know if this is helpful  Hey  thanks for your answer  I do live near a university with hospital but unfortunately it only accepts very poor people because  well  public mental health facilities on my country are a joke   and most of the time  private are too  so they put those thresholds to target those that  really  need it  But theres also some universities who offer free psicological therapy care  theres even one very close to me  I am just a little affraid of trying something witj students given my experience with so called  professionals   Some prejudice of my part  I know You only have 2 options   You could tell him  have a long conversation about how you both want the future to be  where you tell him about your worries that you don't want to let him give up his dream  He could either insist joining the coast guard and not be in a relationship or he could be very supporting and so happy with becoming a father   Or you could not tell him  let the baby be born  With no support from him whatsoever because you didn't told him  You'd be always wondering 'what if' and wanting him and still hoping for a happy ending  Where he'll eventually find out anyway and be mad at you for not telling him sooner and having zero change at ever becoming friends or having a relationship again  Where the baby would also suffer from   So I guess you only have one choice  Tell him  It's the best for everyone  He'll either leave you because he's not ready or he'll love being a father  Better to find out now than wondering for years   May I ask why abortion isn't an option  You should only keep the baby if you really want to  while you can support it financially and give it all of your love and time  Its a tough call  If he got you totally clean and sober from Meth addiction  then he saved your life  It's the equivalent of pushing some out of of the way of a moving train    Easy for people on the outside looking in to tell you what to do  Everyone on Reddit has a moral compass that supersedes Batman and Gandhi   so don't believe everything you read here  Talk to real humans   EDIT  I know this is weird to say but if you contact your local police  it won't help those children  In theory it will but not those specific ones  The local police are not going to allocate funds to hunt down a kiddy porn ring  they only want it in the paper so they look good   Contacting the police  may  be right to do in time  but I've read a lot of posts that essentially say "contact the police right away and then the kids will be safe and happy   and by the way  you will feel better about it in a couple years " I know what I just said was kind of unfair but use your best judgement and don't trap yourself  make a list of pros and cons for alerting authorities   Pros  He goes to jail    child porn rates drop in the USA      the children he has on his phone will be rescued    You won't be disgusted when you look at him because he will be in jail  getting beaten up  and he will never hold a decent job ever again in his life     Cons  What do you think   Again  I'm just saying this stuff because I know what it is like to have one person really help out when I fell on hard times 12 years ago  As far as I am concerned if that person is god to me  And again  don't believe everything you read from these people  If I were seeing a psychologist or a doctor who studies abnormal psychology and they told me that they help people on Reddit  I would instantly lose all respect for them  This is not the medium to offer advice as a professional    I just want him to be happy and I feel like I'll ruin his life if I tell him   Well  you're pregnant no matter if you tell him or not  Not telling him would just come close to a lie  It's also not you who ruins his life  I mean    You didn't get pregnant on your own  right  He's equally  responsible for your pregnancy as you are  And having a child doesn't automatically result in a ruined life   Just tell him what you wrote  That you don't want him to feel obligated  but you'd also be very happy if he wouldn't let you alone with the situation  The rest is his decision  If he's old enough to get you pregnant  he should be old enough to make that decision Life is what you make it  If your life feels empty  then you're not filling it with anything  Most likely you're seeking something  such as approval  or fulfillment from others  You are you  You are your life  There is no other besides you  yourself  If you're unhappy  change it  If you're bored  do something  If you're lethargic  start being more active   For god's sake  you're here for 80 years max  and you're going to waste that time staring at yourself and being miserable  You have one shot  and anything you work hard enough to attain can be yours  You frame your life   If you need it  I'll help get you out of the rut  I've done it for so many others  Just PM me  and we'll get on it right away  You just need somebody who won't judge you to smash that first boot up your ass  to listen to your issues  to be the guiding hand until you have your wings My girlfriend snores and it's honestly one of the cutest things she does  When we snuggle or during some of the few time we get to sleep over it's one of the things that let's me know she's close  I can't help but smile thinking about it  actually    Agreed   Any advice solely hinges on this information Dude  I really appreciate this post  You perfectly worded my own thoughts and struggles Unfortunately FWB usually one of you starts feeling this way  As the previous comment said  you gamble or you don't  You could say something not so direct about it like  "How have things been going without your Mom around "Thanks  This mindset is probably what led me to be so much more successful making friends this time around  I'm not balding but my best friend is and he's like you  very insecure about balding which is completely understandable  ok here's a few things    First of all being bald doesn't instantly make you unattractive  like seriously have you seen the amount of guys who are bald  I know you're young  but it really isn't an instant turn off otherwise half the male population would be fucked     Accept it and embrace it  what I mean by this is that being completely bald looks so much fucking better than a balding comb over  just shave that shit when it gets to that stage   Keep it short  Get your hair cut often it will look much better short  I know the above might seem patronising but trust me I know how you feel  I have a lazy eye and girls have even straight up said "I'd date you if you didn't have a lazy eye" which is shitty as with your situation  it's not in my control but life goes on  I had made food for her because usually she says she doesn't want to eat but then sees me eating and wants some  I made food for her and then said "that's stupid" annoyed when she said she wasn't going to eat it  So I have to prepare for the mental breakdown in 8 years then    Poor Rocket league and poor me  How would someone know their ugly  I don't think I'm ugly but I'm a minority and I'm overweight so I know that limits my options pretty significantly  although I've seen non white guys heftier than me succeed so I know it's all relative  I've been working on the weight thing but it's a freaking hamster wheel  once I'm feeling isolated and depressed my progress reverses  Honestly though I don't think weight is that big a deal unless you're morbidly obese and bedridden  and even then I've read about 500 600 pound men and women finding love  I honestly have no problem dating an overweight woman   Most of my woman friends don't talk about dating  Some of them I know haven't been on dates  Either way I've begged them to set me up  give me advice  and just help me out in general  They've not done that aside from saying that "I'm an amazing person and someone somewhere will like me " While I appreciate the compliment I can't live my life in hypotheticals    r 4rFA is a sausagefest which isn't a big deal if people would take the r4r seriously  There are a lot of dudes in my area who I'd love to grab a beer with but don't want to reply to their m4f topic  As far as meeting women  I've rarely seen posts from FA women there and when there are they're not in my area  Posts from women in my area are sometimes even more selective than what I've seen on the regular r4r sub   Yeah  that's completely true  When I was younger I use to blame myself more  now I realize that it just means I haven't found my kind of people yet  It's no one's fault  Still that doesn't make me feel better whenever I feel lonely or depressed    Hey this is a good conversation idk if it's getting personal but if you want we can continue via PM instead of posting in this sub lol  You can't be THAT ugly if you've got friends This helped a lot  sorry about the post being badly worded I wrote it very angry and upset  I'm gonna go back and ask for the room to speak to her now Keep it that way I would say don't say it or show any sign of it From you saying 'Now for whatever reason  I do not know  but it was possibly the fear of losing you as a friend '  It would seem that that's what you meant   Sorry  clearly it wasn't  but that's what it would seem like   What is it you believe I should take the blame for   Personally  I don't believe I deserve the blame for anything   My apology would be about how things left off  and of quite frankly nothing else as I don't believe I have to apologise for anything else   I am in no way expecting an apology from him   And I don't want one from him either   So there's nothing wrong there Sounds like your friend was r raisedbynarcissists and is experiencing depression  Encourage him to take the advice you'll find in the subreddit I included and seek out a new therapist better suited to his situation It sounds like you are waiting for an "event" to know when the time has come  If you believe her quality of life has diminished to the point where she effectively has to be sedated to be comfortable  I think it may be time to go through with the difficult decision   It will never feel 100  when there is so much love and attachment involved  however  it's better that your partner has an opportunity to remember her in better health than to wait until the lingering question becomes "Did I wait too long "  There is a really beautiful website called www mydogjustdied org which may be a nice way for your SO to get some closure and pay tribute to it    Our vet once told me there are three objective factors to look at when you are trying to decide if it's time  Can the dog eat Does it enjoy food still  Can the dog toilet normally  Is the dog mobile without pain  Hope this helps and we're all thinking of you A Christmas Carol is my second favourite book  after The Hunchback of Notre Dame  because I can relate to how bitter and twisted he was after years of loneliness  Too bad I will never have the opportunity to change like he did Thanks for this insightful answeryou've given me a lot to think about     My initials are JAW  In hindsight  although I have gotten some crap for it in the past  it really isn't that bad     Haha  if only it was "Beiged" or "Off whited " I haven't considered that before     I'm male  and I would be completely fine with my future wife keeping her maiden name  You brought up a good point with the children  thoughthat'll be something I'll have to think about here on out     I would be quite okay with the hassle  This thread made me realize  however  that I should really read up a bit more in regards to U S  naming law   In terms of timing  it looks like I'll be conducting the name change as an 18th birthday gift to myselfthat is  next Octobermy parents would prefer not to have to deal with the whole legal business   As an aside  I might do away with the hyphen  in fact  J      Nguyen Whited  Has a bit of a different feel to it Its very creepyThanks  it sucks how people make assumptions before they get to know you  Thanks for the advice  Here in the US  it seems to be a simple matter of taking the issue to a Superior Court  where they judge the reasoning behind the name change Get help now  You've identified a problem  now go talk to a professional  You don't need their permission to go to a counsellor or therapist  It seems like it is really important for you to have them understand and act  rather than to get help yourself  why do you think that is My parents gave up on me in my teenage years  They knew I would never find friends or a girlfriend and would never give them a grandchild Preach it  I love dating me because I always get to decide where I'm eating  what I'm doing on the weekends  and what presents to buy myself  I mean unless Gillian Anderson comes knocking on my door or Cate Blanchett  I'm good  Every once in a while I get that "aww    I wish someone would hold me" feeling but then I watch Mean Girls or Office Space and then I'm over it IBS is a bitch  I don't suffer from it  but I do have some family members who do  I really feel for you   It sounds to me like you need an ear for the stress though  not a pill  If you ever need to vent  just PM me  I've played counsellor to a lot of people in the last few years  If not  I highly advise you seek out your campus counsellor  College university can be a hell of a battleground  believe me  I know too     and many people only get by with help from the counselling services on offer  You should never have to feel like you're alone I'm not against abortion  it's just something I'm not willing to do to myself  I could never live it down and I'd never forgive myself Thanks  I'm glad     If you're unhappy  change it   If it was that easy  there wouldn't be any unhappy people on earth We are both 20 If you haven't seen this video already  it won't help the "not sure how to change paths" bit  but Steves comments on the importance of finding something  you enjoy and not settling are really great  https   www youtube com watch v UF8uR6Z6KLc  IMO  no matter how high the probable cost to your happiness of jumping to a new job or even industry is  it sounds like it's probably less than the cost of inaction   My advice would be to read  watch and listen to things that inspire you  as corny as that sounds   Elon Musks biography on audiobook was the thing that pushed me over the edge to try a new side gig  and that has been one of the most rewarding experiences in my life  Best of luck  thank you I mean  you actually are   It's worth looking for something that you can at least do part time  Maybe freelance work  so you can do it whenever you can  but don't have to when you're having a particularly bad day   I don't think "profitability" is a particularly good way to measure things  I understand it may be hard to find a job  but not everyone is just a cog in the Capitalist machine that will shut you down without considering you I'm sorry  I totally feel your pain I am sorry  that must be difficult to hear about  Are you still in touch with your first crush Yay  congrats    My fiancee have and I have talked about "running off" and doing the same thing I have no advice  nor will I pass judgment on people who are  simply  human    I send good wishes for a resolution   You've been heard  Good posture and eye contact  aka "fake it til you make it  does not equal getting dates Either way we both know your boyfriend needs to know  You really can't just not even tell him   That being said tell him it's his choice how much he wants to be involved but from what you put below it sounds like you're keeping it and you should tell him this   As a guy who's seen similar things happen before  he may get mad at you at first  Be prepared but give him time to accept it   This is pretty much the point where you see truly what kind of man he is  I agree with the other comment  Its never too late im 25 starting over again  Its better late than never You don't need her parent's permission to get help  Sometimes you have to subvert the parents to get help   The reasons why they don't want to support her through this is their own baggage that has literally NOTHING to do with her  so don't try and make her win their approval to validate her health  That will take too long and they clearly have some shit to sort out with their own mental health if their daughter is being medicated but they can't come to terms with the fact that she is suffering in a very real way  They are going to have to take care of themselves  Focus on your gf and get her help NOW    If she is school age then she can talk to a counsellor at school or uni  These people are trained to help people like your gf  so let them help  Even better  they maybe able to involve her parents  and when they hear this coming from a professional  they might be able to adjust their mindset  Coming from you and your gf  it might be easier to dismiss    This might be helpful  https   kylarosesims wordpress com 2016 11 23 when your partner has anxiety 8 tips for getting help I was referring to why he didn't speak with you on the matter of his depression  Some people are like that  Especially with depression  If you don't want advice  why come here  It seems to me that compromise isn't in your nature  and relationships for all that they are require some level of compromise  I was trying to help you  Not put you down  If you don't want any more advice  stop responding Actually normie is a pretty chill word  It's the ones who use the word  "cuck" unironically that makes me cringe Is this the same guy from  this post  https   www reddit com r dating advice comments 5j2qib how do you move on     Based off what you wrote in that other post he really seems like he doesn't see himself with you and wants to move on  With both of you being 20  I would say that's a pretty good direction to move in  You've been together 4 years since you were 16  and those are tumultuous years where you both are doing a lot of growing   Believe it or not  at 20 you still have a lot more growing to do  Not physically  but mentally  Having been only in one relationship  you don't have a good sense for different types of people in different relationships  People can vary widely  and after being with this guy for 4 years  you probably learned a lot about what you like and what you don't like when looking for a partner  As you date more guys  you will learn more about yourself  not to mention that just getting more real world life experience in general will give you more perspective as well   All this being said  you seem to genuinely want to stay with him  but he wants to break up with you  I don't see his reasons for wanting to break up  but ultimately it doesn't change the outcome  If he wants to break up  then he wants to break up  It could be that while you two were good together as boyfriend girlfriend and didn't have any major issues  but you're just not the person he wants to spend the rest of his life with  I dated a girl for over a year and we had no major issues  There were little annoyances here and there  but nothing that ever hinted at cracking the foundation of our relationship  But after a year I was thinking about our long term future together and when I looked at her I knew that she wasn't the person I wanted to spend the rest of my life with  She was a great person and we had no major issues  but it just wasn't the person I wanted to commit to  That could be him as well  and if that's the case  that's okay  I think you've got the right mindset to let him go if that's his choice  I'm sure it hurts like hell though   So that's my big pep talk to say "You can find another guy " Now  about the baby  Let me say this first  and forgive me since you already ruled it out  Abortion is an option out there  If you choose not to because it's against your beliefs  I completely understand  However  if it's because you feel there's too much external pressure from your parents  boyfriend  or other people  then at least think about it as an option   In any case  whether you decide to abort it  put it up for adoption  or raise it  it's his baby too and he needs to be involved in the decision making process  This is one of the biggest moments of your life  You've taken some adult actions and now there are some adult consequences that you both need to be ready to face  He's free to have whatever feelings he wants  He can be shocked  angry  sad  etc  Whatever feelings he has  allow him to react  but eventually you two have to decide what you want to do together  It would be helpful to let him know that abortion is not an option  From that point  you can talk about adoption versus raising it  and if you're going to raise it  then how big of a role he wants in the child's life   No matter what I say  your parents say  your friends say  or anyone else says  the crux of all of this boils down to the decisions you and your boyfriend make together  Take your time to make those decisions  and don't be too hasty  You don't have to sit down together and figure it all out in one night  In fact  maybe the first time you sit down together  just have the goal to be accepting where you two are  and focus on making your plans for the future in a later meeting   It's scary  There's no good way to say it  There's nothing to worry about in terms of phrasing or delivering the message  This is a big scary unknown question mark for each of you  Talk about your feelings and just get it all out  There's nothing you need to sort out or get ready for ahead of time  This is a conversation you two can have together and figure out as you go  The only thing you should be sure of is that you are truly pregnant  Take a couple pregnancy tests to be sure  Ideally you might have had an OB appointment already to confirm it  but that's not necessary   Logistically  I'd plan to meet with him after he eats  Some time around 2 00PM or so would be good  He'll have eaten lunch and it's still a ways off from dinner  You guys can talk for awhile  then after a few hours maybe you guys have settled down enough that you can get something to eat and talk some more   He also might need space  If you tell him  he may need to take some time to come to grips with the situation before sitting down with you and being ready to talk  Like I said  he might be angry at you  which of course is misplaced anger   but he'll need to work through it  He might be in denial or shock at first  If he needs some space right away  that's okay  Just meet up later then   Sorry  I don't have any concrete answers for you here  Your next step is the biggest one  and that's to talk with him  If you can meet up with him without breaking the news  I think this is the type of news that should be delivered in person versus via the phone or a text message  But seeing as how you two are on a break  maybe you have to tell him in order to get him to come I think it says a lot that she didn't just leave after all of that happened  or didn't just sleep  She stayed up and took care of you  That definitely means something in my book  and I agree with the other users  Give it a little time  Not too much though  Maybe even make it a point to apologize to her friends as well  It's always nice to have the SO's friends on your sideThat  right there  is everybody's go to reaction when forming an excuse for their own lack of inner strength  I've heard it one hundred times  and I've tackled it one hundred times   Zen buddhism is your friend  Its not a point of being 'happy ' its a point of being content  and having the will to master your own fate  Its a long  uphill battle to reach a point of serenity  but when you get there  you'll feel like the wind  Its almost a complete void  but not a negative one  Its a plateau in time and space where only you exist  and everything is malleable to your will  It is not bad at all to lack inner strength  but it is bad to lack acknowledgement of your true state of soul and spirit   Happiness is a human construct  You can define it  or you can remove it altogether  I highly recommend Miyamoto Musashi's Book of Five Rings  Read it  take it seriously  take it all in   "There is nothing outside of yourself that can ever enable you to get better  stronger  richer  quicker  or smarter  Everything is within  Everything exists  Seek nothing outside of yourself "Life is a joke  my friend I suggest writing down how you feel or maybe just taking a moment to breathe  Nothing is as bad as it seems  You have plenty of time to have a good year   If you really need someone to listen to you  there's a website called 7cups where you can talk to someone for as long as you need to Thanks for that  I think I'll play some football and maybe go to some smash tournaments  I just am so tired of this life I'm stuck living at the moment  I wish I could just skip time forward 6 months  It's not a normal thing to occur  Man a people sleep on their backs I really identify with what you're saying  I think loneliness is a natural feeling  but as an introvert who now has a small family I've come to realize that loneliness is far better than being expected to be social  As a mom  I'm expected to make mom friends  but I don't happen to fit into the mold with the moms at the playgroups  I'm Metis  I don't dress in brands  and I don't care for make up so I'm automatically a pariah amongst the other moms as most people simply don't like natives  even if they are whitewashed like me  As a result  I've simply stopped caring if people like me  but that's not good for my children because they need playmates  My wish is to socialize my children  because I know that I am introverted as a result of not being properly socialized as a child  we moved too often for me to learn how to make and build friendships  It wasn't until I was in middle and high school that I made friends with anyone because we finally stayed in one city  Even then I was what I would consider to be a bad friend  though not always  but in some ways I was Are flowers a good idea  They're very cliche and I'm not sure how she'd feel about it So I just wanted to let you know that my appointment was today  She was a great woman and read my list of symptoms that I compiled with my fiancé and sister  She kept a poker face and said it sounds like I have depression and anxiety and suggested medication  there are nurse practitioners in the office who can help me out so that's nice     I'm not sure if I call back for the NP now or wait until the next appointment  1 20   I don't want them to think I'm trying to get drugs or something  I had sleep paralasys 3 times and i always slept on my side so I think its not about sleeping on your back I mean  I was on a couple different antipsychotics  but other doctors questioned the need for that when I would be in the hosp etc  a couple different mood stabilizers  an antidepressant  a benzo  calcium channel blocker that was being used for psych benefits  plus other meds for other things  In fairness  I was on those because most psych meds that I have been on have caused serious reactions requiring ER visits and sometimes stays in the medical hospital    Ultimately  the nightmare scenario is that I am not really responsive to meds that improve mood  I get the sedative effects of some and so I can still use anxiety medication  but as for any mood benefit  I get nothing  It has been well documented in my chart now for over a decade of trial and error with multiple things   The ONLY receptors in my brain that seem to respond in terms of mood are the NMDA receptors and we found that out by accident when I was given ketamine in the ER to break a nasty intractable headache  Turns out  ketamine will improve my mood for 2 3 weeks  I didn't like the "high" but I did like the mood benefit  Sadly  it isn't FDA approved for mood yet  although Johnson and Johnson through their subsidiary Janssen is allegedly nearing the end of phase 3 trials and is expected to release a ketamine metabolite called eskatiamine in intranasal form sometime this year   In the meantime  there are really no drugs for me    That is more info than you wanted I am sure  but yes  there is a way to take more meds  You need a good doctor who knows his her way around the pharmacology If you can't figure it out then just set another reminder for 7 years from now to delete the second reminder  Im sure someone will have figured it out by then   Although  while Japan is witnessing men lost to solitude and withdrawal  aren't the women are just going for white guys   I don't think that's the case   From what I read an unusually large amount of men  and  women are simply not having romantic relationships  For women they apparently find it troublesome to commit to one  since they often end up having to choose between pursuing their careers or becoming a wife   But that's just from memory of things i've read on the matter  so take that info with a grain of salt http   www succeedsocially com practiceconversationI can text "status" to my provider and will get a message with my remaining data and call allowance in return If I told you the whole story from the start  you would either not believe it  or you would stop me in the middle somewhere and tell me that was my problem   I almost broke free from FA last year  but the woman who found me interesting  and was the first non family member to tell me they loved me in a romantic way  decided to go back to her husband and kids after flying over 12 hours to see me and only spending one night cuddling  which meant a whole lot more to me than sex   She was a co worker of mine  we worked online and connected there   and I found myself let go from the company later after others found out  I was used to make her husband jealous and more appreciative of her  In that respect  I suppose I have something to build something from since cuddling for one night was indeed a success  but it's a very tenuous one  as the end result was me feeling even more alone and becoming more abandoned than before  If a similar situation presented itself again  I would probably avoid it because of the fear of it turning out in a similar or even worse way   At my age and at my level of social development  I have trouble believing that it will be worth whatever time and effort it takes to bring myself to a point where others desire to be with me  I would rather learn how to make the most of being alone and find ways to keep myself from wasting time thinking about love and relationships  They are obviously meant for others  even when people say I am lovable  they demonstrate the opposite  I do not trust anyone and I trust myself even less   I am basically just waiting to die  since I have also failed at that several times  the last time gave me a chronic cough that has persisted over 2 years now  so I always sound sick  I don't think I've ever read something on Reddit that I could relate to so much  To keep it simple I went through a lot of the same thing  scrawny dude throughout high school  fantasized about beating the living hell out of anybody who rubbed me the wrong way  even if nobody had actually made me mad  say I was just in a shitty mood  it was almost like therapy to think of someone who had got to me  at any given point in my life and in that fantasy to fulfill very brutal  sometimes even dark violent acts   Moving on honestly man  I think it's a lot more common than most care to admit  mostly I'd imagine because they may feel like they are crazy and feel that's how people would view them  Outlets  You need outlets  I'm going to go on a limb and say something physical  weightlifting  body weight exercises  running  punching the bag  boxing  Personally I found that hobbies that require physical effort  tend to help me channel the anger  and release stress through that  Overtime confidence will build  as will a healthy hobby  that will get you into shape  I've found that overtime those fantasies have subsided a lot  Still happens now and then  but the confidence and being in shape really helps and even when I do have these thoughts  it's not because Im angry because I couldn't necessarily "handle" the situation myself  it's more because I know if I did  it could get you into more trouble then it's worth  Your not alone and not crazy  and I sometimes even still worry that I could potentially really hurt someone if I wanted to follow through but you have to remember those initial thoughts of anger is not who you really are  its what you actually do instead that shows who you are  I can't stress it enough though  you need to have outlets  healthy positive outlets  If you really feel that it's something that's beyond that I would suggest seeking advice from someone more capable of helping  a professional   If that be the case that's totally fine  nothing wrong with getting help if it's needed  Sorry if I side tracked  or rambled but I hope that helps some  good luck OP Very few things in life will come easy  As someone who was very shy and awkward in high school and college  you'll find new chances to try and be yourself  You just have to take those first steps and each one will get easier  You'll meet new people in high school  and then again at college and those are both great times to try free yourself from old expectations   But my parents are pretty strict even though im 21  LelTell me about it I would definitely call back they're not going to think you're med seeking  you're following up on her recommendation  I'm glad she was a great woman and you had an okay experience  Did you tell her about the cancer fears Gambling addiction really sucks and as someone close the situation can be awful  just like you described  You can't force him into therapy  but there are a few things you could do that isn't breaking up  You can put your foot down and start making demands about certain things    A lot of it has to do with economy  Separate your economy from his if you share it today  as much as possible   Be pragmatic and make sure you can pay the rent yourself if needed to  You need to avoid falling into debt yourself  Furthermore  don't lend him any money  don't co sign loans etc  Simply think twice or more before helping out financially  It sounds rough  but if it affects you this way  what are your options  All this can be very difficult  because there's a fine line between being supportive and enabling    Regarding the conversation with your mom  you decide what you want to say  Think of the consequences  If you tell her the real reason  her opinion might be tarnished of your boyfriend  Or is it possible she'd understand and offer  well needed   support to you and or him  Would it be favorable or unfavorable to "out" his problems  As I see it  this is not only his problems but yours as well now  which means you decide what you do  He has no say in this    And lastly but most importantly  do things you like  Never stop doing things that make you feel good  Exercise  going to classes  whatever  Don't quit because of the gambling  A lot of relatives tend become more inactive which may cause further anxiety and less well being    Stay strong and try to think of what is best in the long term  You will probably have falling outs but they're easier to handle now than when you're drowning in debt  And I know you want to understand why he's gambling  especially if things are otherwise good but he might not know it himself  Most often the gambling isn't a problem for several years until something happens and it turns into a vicious spiral  Your relationship is at a critical point  He has just done something very bad  and you are looking for ways to fix it  This means that he gets to gamble  which satisfies his urge  and you clean up the mess  There is no meaningful negative consequence for him  If you want to have any change at saving this relationship  there MUST be a meaningful consequence for him   Be aware that this may be the beginning of the end for you guys   Unless you want to spend your life cleaning up after an addict   Breaking an addiction is a life long commitment  Frankly  I doubt you will be able to change his behavior  You leaving him may be the rock bottom he needs to not fuck his next relationship  but he has broken your trust pretty badly  and it will a tough job to fix this kind of damage   Having said that  you need to take action NOW to have any chance at happiness with this guy  Sit him down and talk to him  Use decisive language  explain that he has just used his one chance  Tell him he needs to call a gambling help right now  while you are talking to him  He has to make an appointment right now  Tell him he must keep the appointment  or you are done  Tell him that you are taking over control of the finances as of right now   There can be no excuses  If he doesn't comply  that is when you know you have lost him to addiction and it is not worth your time to stick around  It is all down hill from here    Goodluck  you are going to need it    Same   Music is one of those things that is supposed to be easiest to talk about  but when you listen to video game and anime music OSTs all the time you can't talk about it since it's viewed as weird   What have you been listening to specifically  For me  i've been listening to the  Death Note  https   www youtube com watch v Ye84 weWf 8  and  Kaiji  https   www youtube com watch v Oog3m3LrA8A list PLgAG0Ep5Hk9JWmF0JbBDQ SQgh2rpSPjx  OSTs as well as listening to the  Ace Attorney  https

Anyways  if that's the case  we're the same age  I don't study but spend most of my time on the computer too  Though I do sometimes play for too long  I don't think you should drop it all together unless you're not enjoying it yourself  I don't got much of a life either but I've picked up calisthenics and lifting not too long ago and it's definitely helped me become a healthier person  Not only that but it helps me sleep easier e g longer nights   better mornings  You could try and pick up a sport aswell as exercising  If you don't like American Football I'm sure there's a sport out there for you  I honestly can't see how you're going to drop gaming all together because I know i sure can't  Good luck haha Thank you  Unfortunately she made very sure that he wasn't on my birth

on Reddit using a different account   It may be that talking about it online doesn't make it as real as talking about it to people in person wouldI feel you  I have been there  What have you tried already  It looks like you are getting ready to talk about it and share since you have posted here  Who are you afraid to talk to  Anyone or just random people  professionals  Getting help really sucks  the irrational fear of saying it outloud is very  very real to lots and lots of people  You are not alone  The sooner you reach out for help from a professional  the sooner you will get better    You can even try online therapy with talkspace  better help or 7 cups  Calling a hotline when you are calm might be a good place to start and you can see how good it can be to talk to someone and how you don't have to be afraid  Everybody makes quick assumptions  just  most of us keep our mouths shut  and wait and see what reality is   That's what being social is all about     As an older person  60   I'm sorry to say that this ability sometimes fades with age and the dimunition of mental faculties in certain people    not all by any means   I see it in people who were better than that  10 or 20 years ago   And it makes me sad  100  agree here  without a doubt  They key to not having a baby is to either not have sex or use protection  The moment you choose not to follow those key pieces of advice  then you're willingly taking that risk and in doing so you know what can happen  Why would I care about a stranger  In that case  I'm young  beautiful intelligent and intimidating  Don't you believe me     I just pointed out that you sound like an arrogant jerk in your post  and you made some ignorant remarks in another thread I was browsing which is what sort of gave me this impulse to mention all of this to you just now    Kind of like feeling the need to yell "jerk off " to a dude who cut you off on the highway  even if it doesn't really help the situation and pulls you down to their level But my phone does it on its own and there is never a reply from the number that is the saddest partagreeing to pay for it opens the way to her asking for more and more bullshit  If she is upset by that then she is probably not the kind of friend you want in your lifeYea I'm sure you got a little anxiety since I also have it  I could just go tell you to get it checked out but that's boring  right  If you truly want to overcome anxiety it's up to you  There are lots of videos on YouTube that help you through this  but what I usually do is I listen to music  or do something that helps me feel calmer before I go into crowds or something  If I'm around with friends I'm not as shy  Since you said it's only around people you don't know  friends can play a big part when it comes to coming out of your shell  Has something happened in your life that's possibly made you feel like this  The only thing worse than living in misery is dying in it  Stay alive  enjoy gore and murder  and show your middle fingers to the void  The reason why he didn't come to me was because he thought I was a backstabber   This was said directly to my face   He never spoke to me about his situation because he thought I betrayed him   I came here to get an answer to a question   The rest is just set up   Granted  yes  you answered the question   However  you are saying that I did something wrong and that I see him as the one at fault  which is entirely not the case   This has nothing to do with compromise  it's to do with reconciliation   I'm not looking to compromise with him  I'm not even looking to have a friendship with him   I'm just wondering if I should reconcile with him  which is the basis of my question   I did nothing wrong and I shouldn't be looking to take the blame for something that I didn't do   That is counterintuitive   I'm not even looking forgiveness from him  I just want to let it be known how I feel right now   It would be entirely different if I actually did do something wrong and 'escalated' his situation as you had claimed earlier   But that's not the case  my friend He had reciprocated love though  he just chose money over that  I don't think we've ever been presented with that kind of choice   But other than that nitpick  I'd say his later years fit the bill  especially the bitterness he accumulated throughout his life Thank you  I've thought about this a lot recently and it makes a lot of sense  Though I always have that little voice of doubt telling me that if he really wanted to be in my life  then she wouldn't be an obstacle  But she's made it her mission to be that obstacle  It's bad  man  Bad af   I can't think straight to do anything like that now  but I appreciate the advice  Thank you Couple things  If you do a selfless deed  then it shouldn't matter what the person thought of it  You can still do good deeds and expect a thank you  but don't call them selfless  If you feel down for not getting something back then stop and really consider your motivations  Helping people is one of the toughest things  because you you're guessing what people need  without knowing what they're ready to receive    If you want to be selfless  then make an exercise out of it  Give a dollar to a homeless person  and walk away without seeing their reaction  if it makes sense  you know  like if they're sitting down holding a cup out   Or I used to go to bars a lot and girls would expect me to buy them a drink  so I'd say fine  Buy them a drink  then walk away and talk to someone else     Body dysmorphic disorders  including anorexia nervosa  are mental health issues  It isn't about what you look like  it's about the dysmorphic body image you have       With that in mind it isn't something you can talk someone out of  it isn't something you can love someone out of  It's a mental health issue and has to be dealt with by professionals      With that out of the way  from the limited window your description allows I'm not sure your girlfriend is showing signs of body dysmorphia  She seems to just want to lose some weight which shouldn't be seen as a bad thing so long as she stays inside healthy BMI and healthy body fat percentage       With that said  it's important to note that calorie restrictive diets are not long term solutions  I have the same problems and I googled it one day and I believe it is somewhat connected to "intrusive thoughts" which is a side effect of OCD supposedly  I don't think I have OCD and I couldn't tell you if you did either but reading your story makes me identify with mine as well  I'm a 20 year old female who has always been physically small and though I wouldn't go as far as to say I was ever "bullied" I've had some people in middle high school who attempted to target me no doubt bc of my nature of appearing somewhat shy and being so small    I value the idea of power and getting stronger and I ALWAYS envision myself beating up other people in my head for various reasons that I turn out to be either the hero or just apparent as tough and strong to others  I've even gotten to the point where I think something might be wrong with me bc I often have violent daydreams of hurting those I love such as my family and sometimes friends and random people  I know I could never really do these things  but the daydreams visions themselves are enough to be alarming bc I too am afraid that one day my temper will flare and I will actually end up hurting either a random person or someone I know and love  but I think this is unlikely  These are just thoughts and you have to remember that  Maybe try googling intrusive thoughts and see if you identify with that as well  If anything  If it bothers you too much you could try talking to someone you trust really well or perhaps a therapist  But I don't think you should worry about it at all that much  they're just thoughts and nothing more  So sorry for her and you  But like the first reply says   what does your grandma want  You say she is 88  Cancer treatment can be awful for anyone  especially when you are older  It will be up to her to decide after discussing options with her doctor  Cancer is horrible  but many types can be treated now with all the new advances  What she needs now is a supportive family  not a bickering one  You are close to her   stay strong I'm really happy for you  that's awesome   You seem to have a lot more self awareness than I did as a high school freshman  so you've got that going for you  A lot of the alternative activities you have suggested already sound like great ideas  too  I was going to suggest exercise until you mentioned it  and programming will teach you things about problem solving that will serve you well even if you don't end up doing much coding in the long term   It is not a lack of good alternatives that's the real problem  but the fact that if you try to quit something cold turkey  especially something you enjoy  you're going to struggle  Quitting smoking isn't made difficult just by the addictive effects of nicotine  but also by the enjoyable things one does while smoking  even if that is nothing more than taking a five minute break from work or studying  It fills the time  gets your mind on something else for a little while    That said  I think you should quit League and Clash  but not Overwatch  Why  The first two you admit are toxic and no longer enjoyable  while you still enjoy Overwatch  or at least it sounds that way   There's nothing wrong with "just" cutting back  Overwatch isn't going to give you cancer  And hanging onto that fun bit of gaming is going to make it easier to shed the less fun parts   Source  Spent far  far too much time playing video games in college  Now have a career  a wife  and

rape apologists run rampant in this sub  Actions have consequences  and consuming material is the first step to producing your own  That gap CANNOT be bridged  It needs to stop NOW I know just how this feels  Terrifyingly wonderful  Wonderfully terrifying  But mostly the scary part  They're so worth it  insecurities be damned Legoland  Maybe It doesn't cause weight gain invisibly  it makes you crave sweets and be ravenously hungry all the time  I took it for a few weeks several years ago and all I thought about was chocolate  I did gain about seven pounds in those few weeks  but it may not happen to you  Evefyone is different  and if it does give you this side effect  you WILL know  it's very noticeable  so then you can decide if you want to continue  However  there's no reason not to try something that might help  you can always stop if you do not like the effects   Take it at night and make sure you have a full eight hours for sleep  It can make you extremely sleepy I gave advice  You don't have to take it  Do as you please And at 18 she's probably been gunned out less  or one would hope  so there would be more room for new experiences  sexual and non sexual  to share together    Older women are intimidating as at 24 I still feel like a manboy  I browse tinder and so many women make themselves look older than they need to  it's a real turn off  I don't like that "done up" look  I prefer natural looking girls as opposed to girls that paint on their eyebrows and wear high heels    Make sure they're not tge only pair you ever wear   They should get completely dry between wearing them  ideally you switch between different pairs of shoes If I make plans with a guy i want to go but once the plans are final and you keep saying how excited you are and constant messages up until the date is a sure fire way to change my mind  I need space  Nothing wrong with being keen though but before first date it can be off putting  My SO's snoring makes me sleepy  so when he starts snoring it does the opposite and puts me to sleepMostly just Movie and TV Soundtracks  I don't listen to any artist or genres Of course I wouldnt fucking make an excuse for him if he was caught making out with a 13 year old  I also DID say he was contributing to the demand of CP  although youre trying to make it out like I didnt  Also  when did I say it was healthy for 13 year old girls to take nude photos of themselves   Why do you put so many words in my mouth and take everything I say to the extreme  Please STOP   First off  I think it is bullshit to suggest that OP's boyfriend has already "acted on" his urges  He hasnt  He has some illegal pictures but he has not made any attempts to seduce  molest  or otherwise harm underage girls  In my eyes it is far from too late for him to get help  He could still go to one of those institutions and get help  he doesnt nessecarily have to admit to having the photos    he can wipe himself clean now  make the decision to better himself  and go get the help he needs  You're saying we should just turn him in and give him a record that will prevent him from getting any good job  destroy his dreams  pretty much make it impossible for him to have a normal life ever again    Contrary to what you think  I dont think he's a worthless human being who doesnt deserve help or a chance at a normal life because he "crossed a line" and broke the law   How would I feel if someone jacked off to a picture of my daughter in a cheerleading outfit  Well  before I answer another one of your baseless "THINK OF THE CHILDREN" argument  Id like you to remember it was the parents who posted the photos of their daughter in a skimpy outfit on the internet  and if you post something to the internet  you are accepting the fact it is there forever  and anyone is allowed to see it  download it  and do whatever with it  If the thought of someone possibly jacking off to the picture of your daughter scares you  maybe you shouldnt be putting the photos on the internet  because youre pretty much accepting the possibility it could happen when you post it  My answer to your question would is yes  I would be disgusted  however they arent breaking the law and I accepted that possibility when I posted that photo of my daughter  so I would have no one to blame but myself   I have certain values that I stand by in life  I believe you should be loyal to your friends and loved ones and be there to help them in their time of need  and they'll do the same when you need it because that's how friendship works  OP's boyfriend has already shown this loyalty to her  I think it would be wrong and heartless to turn your boyfriend in immediately in this situation without even trying to talk to them or get them help first  knowing that turning them in will effectively ruin their life for good  Sure  OP doesnt technically "owe" him anything  but friends dont do things for each other because they owe them  they do it because they are their friend  Turning her boyfriend in will just ruin their life and any chance at happiness  and if anything more likely to act on their urges once they're out of jail  Doing what you can to warn him and get him help now doesnt ruin his life and is more likely to get him on the right path  If it was my friend  especially if it was someone I loved  I know which I choose   OP  I know my opinion may be unpopular in this thread  but I encourage you to think about what Ive said when you make your decision  Im so sorry you have to go through this  best of luck It's funny how these types of people  including those against drugs  usually abuse cigs and alcohol on the reg   There's a drug that stops hiccups but also gives crazy anxiety  I'd like to see one of them on that drug  look them in the eye  and ask them if anxiety is real And  of course  no protection is foolproof  And birth control is the responsibility of both partners  As is the result if it fails You are correct  she made sure to leave him off  I think my Aunty knew him  but she's of that same mentality  that I'm selfish and that my Mother should be enough for me  and won't discuss it with me  Currently listen to Flumes album skin a lot  I love it  It's simply beutifull R You never answered my other question   What do you think I should take the blame for Is this like an American version of Jeremy Kyle Thank you so much  That makes a lot of sense now that you say these things  I guess I'll keep on going Nah fam you good as long as that isn't your everyday clothe  But face wise you're quiet good looking Do what you gotta do    Keep this mindset and your success rate in life will rise  Even when it's tough  or hard  or when you don't want to do something  you still have to  It sucks  it's painful  it's boring  Whatever it is  everyone goes through those things  If you just accept that it's part of life instead of fighting it all the time you'll be happier and it won't bother you as much  You made it clear you don't have any intention to apologize  so there's no reason to answer the question  That not asking for advice  It's being bitter  Just let it go and go about your day I know  that's not what I meant at all  He has autism He's just racist I hope you got to your appointment today  You could also be battling postpartum depression  Babies are supposed to make  moms happy  but they are a lot of work  and sometimes you just get mentally exhausted  Don't be afraid to get help and meds to deal with it  It is not a sign of failure  just acknowledging that you can't always be perfect  That's wasn't my point exactly darlin  Assuming that OP and her boyfriend has unprotected sex  then they actively took the chance of her getting pregnant  As opposed to not even trying to prevent said pregnancy to begin with  Of course nothing is fool proof darlin  but again that wasn't my point    Don't fret bro  Everyone is dealt a different hand in life  and it's how they play it that defines them   not the hand itself  in this case balding   There are plenty of options to go about handling this  none of which involve suicide because that's completely unnecessary  At the very least  approach some mens fashion subs or even someone who's considered a professional to give you some tips on how to accentuate your positive features and make the balding work for you           A counselor can help some  but go to the people who will give you advice on how to look and feel good  You can do it  and you'll be surprised by the results  If it's that bad  just shave your head and then go from there because it looks better than a half dome and there's plenty of chiks who like balding dudes          I would be seriously bummed out to hear you killed yourself over something so trivial that you can manage even though I don't even know you  You got this homie no problem  but just to be certain because i don't want to let you leave still thinking about suicide  did you reach out to people  or talk to a therapist or doctor    Have a great day You're welcome  Please don't do anything dangerous   3I really recommend giving 2 weeks notice  It will make you more employable in the future  If it's a shitty I job  that sucks but you can survive two weeks  It could've gotten worse and sounded like it was if he was fucking dry humping  I'd make him serve tbhI have no intention to apologise   That is my intention   Have you been paying attention    My intention is to apologise for how things left off and finished i e  ignoring his messages   There is no bitterness in that   I just cannot comprehend what it is you believe I've to take the blame for   So I do believe it to be worth it to answer the question   I mean  for Christ's sake  I'm trying to wash out a stain from my past here Judge the reasoning  Yikes  about the only thing you can't do here is change your name to something like having "doctor" or "princess" as your first name so that you aren't trying to get a title you can't legally have  Well good luck all the same My advice may not be what your looking for  but first thing is first  Let her know you care and want the best  Secondly and just as important is know her meds or allergies to medications  I have had to deal with my step moms smokimg problems and have had to explain to paramedics her situations and saved her a few times  If your mothers smoking is as bad as you believe  Be as prepared for the worst just in case  It can save her life I read through your post and could tell  even before you mentioned an age range  that you're young  Your tendency to view all events as being negative and personally damning is something many teens share  Just understand that no one around you is as focused on you as you are  They don't notice or think all the things about yourself that you imagine they do  They are also  like you  thinking about how dumb  silly  stupid  awkward  ugly  etc  they are  and how everyone must be aware of it  It makes people miserable   However  negativity and positivity are a mindset  You can look at yourself and others in many different ways  but you've gotten stuck on negativity  I'd recommend talking to a counselor and getting your thoughts out there  They don't judge  and it feels good to have someone there who listens  The link is broken      And that sounds like a good idea  but I don't have any activity on this account so it might seem sketchy  This is a throwaway account since he knows my actual one  It will pass within a week or two  I went through the brain zaps and overall dizziness  This will not harm you as long as you don't do anything that requires full attention such as driving a car It's actually unclear from all the information you gave  but it's up to you in the end  we are just here to try to help  If you still love your ex and think you have a chance of getting back with her  I think you should go for your ex  If you don't think you can get back with your ex  then maybe go out with this new girl  get to know her better and see what happens  I have to say  I'm currently suffering from unrequited love and trying to keep the friendship with this girl I have feelings for  but it would be so much easier if I had someone to help me  You're lucky that you got a good girl looking for you  but of course  in the end it's up to you  As much as you love your ex  there is a reason she is your ex  it's just like this girl I like  as much as I like her  she only likes me as a friend  there is no way I can ever have more than that  but I'm lucky to have the chance of keeping her in my life  Whatever your choice is  I truly think you should talk to this new girl about it to avoid hurting her  I would say something in the lines of "hey x  I need to talk with you  I know you have feelings for me but at the moment I'm in a tough situation  I still have feelings for my ex  but I really enjoy the time I've spent with you  I would like to go out with you and get to know you better  but I don't want to hurt you in any way that's why I'm warning you about this in advance  If you're still willing to go out with me I will be glad to meet you up someday"  Maybe I fantasized a bit too much  but this is what I would sayIf it's any consolation  your personal growth is something to be proud of  When you look back and see how far you've come from  you deserve a pat on the back    You're not unlovable  I have those moments  too  and I don't think we're the only ones  I'll admit it would be nice having someone to count on  absolutely and without a doubt  but I console myself with the reminder nothing is certain  Moments of envy don't take into account the full picture  since we don't know what is going on behind the scenes of that Hallmark moment  You just have to look out for yourself and find comfort in the things that we know for sure we can control  even if it's simple pleasures  oops here you go   http   www nhc net nz index lizards new zealand jewelled gecko Naultinus 20gemmeus 20male 20Jewelled 20gecko 201 jpg  You might need to create another throwaway and generate some activity before you replyI think you're using "not caring" as an excuse to not make yourself vulnerable  You yell yourself you don't care to get out of the uncomfortable feelings of being aocial  It let's you off the hook  Try just socializing anyway  even if you "don't care"  You may find that you do in fact care  and you may meet some really awesome people  your business  no one elses  Okay good  I'm definitely going to call because she said she thinks I'll benefit quite a bit   Yeah she mostly asked about my childhood and stuff  She asked about surgeries  medical tests  etc  I thought she'd ask more about the dissociation and stuff but maybe next time  It was only half an hour   Too messy  Personally  I'm really lucky as I've become a lot more social in 2016  Few past months I've been going out weekly but honestly it's actually made me less confident because at the back of my mind  I know I'm unattractive  If a girl is approached by someone unattractive  they'll think of him as a creep or some shit so I've always never attempted it  Maybe one day I'll build the courage to start talking to girls at clubs because I can't take being forever single anymore Same age range  I'm 30    The thing is  a stable  moderately older guy can get women very easily and will go for a smokin' hot  more mature woman than me   who  is probably younger     you're really strong   you made the best thing for you    i totally get what you said in the end   might now be going through that right now but i did in the past ´ It was a beautiful post to readAlternative Rock  R B  Pop   Recently all I've been listening to is  Chilli Peppers  Oasis  Artic Monkeys and Catfish and the Bottlemen For real XD instead of downvotin her they should be trying to get with her  That's like being homeless and turning away McDonald's I'm doing that right now  Got school on Wednesday    What did you doBut what does it do for you though  I could look up an article about a beautiful supermodel not having to work a day in her life but I don't because I know I'll get jealous  Apologizing is compromise  You said you don't intend to compromise  The bitterness is towards me  Not him  I've been trying to help you  but your replies have been written in bitterness  If there was something you didn't understand  I have no problem talking it out with you  but keep in mind I am a person as well  The isn't my job  I'm taking time out of my day as a concerned stranger to give people advice where I can  Whether it is things easy to hear or not  I gave my opinion by the context given to me  If you are unhappy with it  just accept it and move on  Last message  I won't be responding anymore  If you are going to list this job on your resume  then give them notice  If not  not necessary but not professional  Eh  I work in customer service  so I think it's entirely possible to run into assholes all day  Although 30 is admittedly high  Most of the time  people are cool  They're there to get their shit and move on with their day    If you think everyone sucks all the time  then that is an issue  I won't even say that holds salt  You may be taking things personally and overemphasizing your negative interactions  Unfortunately  the numerous neutral interactions don't stand out to us   I don't give a fuck what you look like  Maybe you are all of those things  Kudos to you   I am an arrogant jerk and I'm proud of it There is nothing morally wrong with an abortion  Fetuses aren't capable of feeling pain until the third trimester  and if it is an unwanted baby it might be better to get an abortion  It is your choice though  Do YOU want the baby  If you really don't want it  keep an open mind to the idea of abortion  since you said yourself youre not against it  actually i would believe you  nobody would make this shit up   If you feel like it PM me your story  I promise you not to judge  soon 25 and still FA here lol someone kill me They are Vietnamese  and ironically  both doctors   Its the fact that Vietnamese culture doesn't believe in mental illness Chessington world of adventures and the London zoo is will be good places try  Lovely lizard    okay  here we go   A man is walking in a graveyard when he hears the Third Symphony played backward  When its over  the Second Symphony starts playing  also backward  and then the First  Whats going on  he asks a cemetery worker  "Its Beethoven  says the worker  Hes decomposing    Also  that could take

things  make stupid decisions  help others  Just do something other than waste your brain on those things    They're okay as an entertaining source of stimulus every once in a while  but any more than that is unhealthy   I recommend you immediately start reading instead  Books on philosophy would be a great place to start  Use those teachings to better your own life this only applies if you already passed your birthday in the current year  you should add  1 if you haven't reached your birthday yet this yearLiterally me    A while back I'd been speaking to this girl quite a lot  she told me how great of a personality and how much of a similar sense of humour we had  She'd told me secrets she'd not even told her parents  Personality  sense of humour and trust   all things perfect for a relationship    right  Wrong   She would then go on about how she fancies a guy in the same class and wishes she knew if he had the same feelings  Can't help you there  I dropped out of college after suffering from years of severe depression and a recent family tragedy  I keep saying that if I just had one truly meaningful relationship  if just one girl had taken notice in me  I might not have given up  But I did  And I don't really regret it to this day  hahaha love it   are many people replying to his posts The issue isn't a lack of help  the issue is her parents don't care about depression and anxiety  they dismiss it as just some fake illness people use to avoid doing work Just don't bother with comb overs  a la Trump   own it   My first husband looked like Craig T  Nelson  but only 5'7"   I suppose these days it's more common to shave it all off but back then he just kept it short and clean and he was impossibly handsome to me   He was 18 when he started losing it  too  Persona  Gatchaman Crowds and Furi most recentlyDamn bro that sucks to be cucked like that  Honestly fuck that hoe man just do you and find yourself a better person  Noted  thanks for your reply   You mentioned drug issues so I was wondering  Has he gotten help  It wouldn't help the fact that I was a 25 year old kissless virgin still  That I was craving that affection  It'd just mean there were tons of other people like me  which seems kinda sad  I wouldn't wish this on anyone I'm really sorry    Are they not returning fb messages  texts  etc     This is the horrible about college that non fa people can't understand   it's always  you   fa person  who will live and die at the mercy of other people  because we're always extraneous   I went nuts because I failed to do a few things    1  I let my grades go  and failed to intern  so not only was I all alone after graduation  I didn't graduate with my class  and I was unemployed  I passed my classes but only barely and my mother tortured me   You cannot let loneliness rob you of your ability to focus on getting out of school employable   I know that's very painful to hear b c everyone else around you seems to be having the fucking time of their lives  while you're bouncing off the walls    2  I failed to make friends   in class  Coming early  leaving later  FB and seeing where people hung out or accepting the random invite to get to know someone outside campus made a difference after college  I have one friend   I really blew that during college itself    3  This is something I struggle with now   if a group gets sour   you can't let that control your life  I know it's hard  This is a tip I can't fulfill myself  esp  when you want your old friends  not to gamble on making new ones    I struggle finding new groups too    4  If you're depressed  for God's sake  get treatment for it  You might be doing alienating things you're not aware of   Anyway   I identify with a lot of this  Both thinking of my own time in college  and as an adult now  I think I'm a pretty nice person and I mimic others' sense of humor  I listen to them  and I don't shittalk as much as a lot of more popular people I know    This is the catch 22 of being a loner  you are often forgettable  you lack the tastes  hobbies  and experiences of the sort of person who will share common ground with others  That's what I'd attempt to do    go to book talks and university calendar events  learn to do interesting stuff alone  It helps actually giving an impression of a memorable person     I recommend posting in the college subreddit too   I'm so sorry you're going through this    First of all if you have rly bad self image issues like anorexia or bulimia pls see a doctor  Assuming you have any issues like that taken care of I would advise you to reflect on what interests you in general  For me personally I've always loved space  I've always wanted to do astrophysics since around 7th grade  This summer I plan to go down to a university to attend a physics program  I'm 15 so I really had to push for this opportunity   Do something like that  If your so worried about how people view you that it's hard for you to present yourself  I would a  see if it's a problem you can fix and b  if its not think about how much it rly matters  If this is difficult for you imagine someone making fun if you for this said issue  would you look bad or would they just look like an idiot asshole  If nothing interests you sitting behind your monitor can be ok  As long as you have a sustainable job and keep yourself in good shape  Staying in shape is key to personal happiness as well as mental health  If you find yourself sitting around all day as I did over the break  get up and go on a walk or something  If you rly wanna put yourself out there maybe go backpacking or something  Exploring new things will open up gateways to new happiness and you'll find drive to push yourself through life positively You'll meet interesting people when working  boring jobs  The advice I would give to you would be to look at improving your social skills as it can take you places and don't worry much about what job Good to know  thanks Please if you can   take this advice because this has really changed the whole of 2016 for me   I started Uni last year in the same city as I live in  I decided to go to student halls  totally out of my comfort zone  but I was determined to become more social  It was difficult to start but now I've made really close friends and I've actually started becoming more at ease when talking to girls She is diagnosed  yes  but her parents are only willing to read about the issue  finding things that only benefit their argument  dismissing all the claims about how serious this kind of stuff is  Her parents are a bit arrogant about their own knowledge Couldn't have said it better  Having expectations from anyone about anything can only lead to disappointments  I would love to do that  Unfortunately  drugging someone without their consent is highly illegal Canada  Basically you either have open  or closed where at 18  or sometimes 16  the child has the option to look for their parents  or ask for their file to stay closed  The only issues are if people have changed names  after adoption or marriage  and moved where it might be a bit of a challenge to track them down  or if the child rejects contact  Yeah  i go to a psychologist  i have some interests but there are really no superfancy  places around here specially made for those  I try to keep myself in shape  atleast for now you'd be swimming inn pussy if u'd hit the gym and get abit svole  And there shouldn't be any reason for you to not get laid  Your tall and look pretty decent  Try to avoid the friend zone The stats are really eye opening  but also present a huge opportunity  Changing the American diet can significantly prolong and improve the quality of life for hundreds of millions of people   It's easy

arrested   Can you transfer to another school  "just before I graduated" is not very clear  How many hours do you have left until graduation   I just saw the "last semester of my last year"   so say 15 semester hours left   Do you have any student loans that need to be paid off  Was it drug related  Etc  I doubt you totally "wasted" your parents money as credits earned are still credits  Go get

humble opinion I think you should have a talk with him  If you feel like he may feel obligated to not go on with what he is intended to do   tell him that it doesn't have to be like that   Your future child deserves a dad  if he wants to be a part of his life  And he may have hurt you by breaking up but still   he has the right to know what is going on  even if you don't end up together Do it  do it  do it  This is the best possible experience you can get out of a retail job  and believe it or not  it will open MANY doors for you in the future  There's a HUGE difference between a person who worked retail as a burger flipper and one who worked retail as a manager How is that being a troll  You have completely misunderstood what a troll is  A troll does this kind of thing because it's funny  I don't think he's funny  I genuinely think he's a failure and should stay out of places for discussion when his maturity level is akin to that of a 7 year old How did you make those initial friends Ah  It also makes sense as there are also people living there now  Thank you for the info    I get what you are saying  It is not a collaboration  I'm paying a few people to write a particular piece I am looking for that I can't find online for my personal reading pleasure  I may not have worded that very well when I used the term hijacking but I am not happy that they tried to change the background of the characters despite me stating what I was looking for  They got hooked on and excited about an idea that would transpire between a minor and a major character that would end up taking away the focus of the two main characters and if that really happened  that would make me miserable because that is a pretty expensive piece  to me  that I am paying for something that I don't want   And this is only a one shot piece too  If I were compromising  I'd be trying to make a frienship work   That's not what's happening   I'm trying to reconcile  which is not trying to compromise   If bitterness is what you're getting from this  okay then   That's not my intention  but fine   Again  I'm not getting what it is I have to take the blame as  again  I believe I've done nothing wrong   I understand that you're taking time out of your day  as am I   You're the one willingly on Reddit  doing what you're doing  no one's forcing   I'm certainly not   So don't come to me with those types of complaints   I'm taking my time for this too  you know   All I did was ask questions   Tone of voice cannot be taken from text  so again  if bitterness is what you're getting  then that's not my intention   All I want to know is how you're fully thinking about this   What do you think I am responsible for   If you don't reply  fine then  you can act like that   Just know that there isn't a full understanding of the situation here Ok  thank you   Don't think I have a preference  I'd be open to anywhere from about 20 to mid 30's  maybe 40ish Well you certainly should break it off in my opinion if you feel it is going too fast and it isn't what you want right now  I know it's advised against to break up through text but that doesn't stop many people  If you feel you absolutely can't do it in person  or over the phone then a text is the only other way to go  You should just tell him how you feel and why you feel it won't work out  so as to give closure  which I feel helps better than a "it's not you it's me" type thing     The fact that he was so quick to say I love you and insist upon you meeting his family THEN claim your tattoos "aren't lady like"  whatever the hell that means  are red flags IMO  and I'm certainly not trying to sway you away but these sound like all the more reason for you to break it off    I think people tend to respect it more when you break up in person  though experiences will certainly vary  If you feel for whatever reason that he might get upset beyond consolation and possibly violent if you do it in person  then obviously don't do it in person  As I stated before your next options are over the phone or through text and your sample text you posted in your description seems alright in addition to my suggestion of whatever you end up saying  make sure you explain yourself enough as to give closure and reasoning for your decision as this tends to make people feel better I think as they actually know what went wrong  and what possibly to work on in the future if need be  Good luck  Don't feel bad about it whatsoever  you've gotta do what's best for you  You mean dorms  I'm going to a different city so I would be staying in one  I'll probably be the Cho of the dorms though  Is there some kind of stress or dissatisfaction you have with your life right now  Any pressure at work that has been seething beneath your skin   I will use my family as an example   I personally  am usually more like you  in that I am a genuinely happy drunk all the time     My sister on the other hand  has an emotional disorder  think BPD  and while fairly normal sober  her drunk self is the most intensely terrifying thing I have ever seen  IT IS LIKE SHE IS POSSESSED  I kid you not  She scratched at the doctors face as he  tied  her to a gurney and has threatened her BF with a knife    she is like this almost every time she is drunk though  she starts out with happy  moves to sobbing  and then goes straight to 'needing an exorcist' mode   I'd say if it is remarkably unusual behavior for you  then it may have been drugs    because EMT's are very used to seeing absolutely insane drunks  If i become a spider  i will make you a spider too  Hohoho  PThey've not questioned why I'm still single but they always go on about how they can't wait to baby sit my kids and how they'll be sure to support me when I get married  Depresses the fuck out of me because they have no idea  Sometimes I just want to tell them but I'm not sure how they'd react see this is where it is messed up  It takes 2 people to decide to have sex but only one person's opinion to keep a child and be responsible for it for the next 18 years  He asked for time away  and she interpreted that as a way of breaking up  her words   Doesn't  that mean that he is no longer her boyfriend    Shitty question to ask  but is OP 100  sure that it's the ex boyfriends  Oh get the fuck away from me with that SJW type bull shit      consuming material is the first step to producing your own  That's EXACTLY why I never had thoughts about producing my own porno   Even after all that 18  porn I happen to have on my HDD from various porn websites   Also exactly why drug addicts who consume drugs rarely have the though of producing their own meth  cocaine  etc    I'm not a pedophile apologist  say what you want  I still think what he's doing is wrong  and if OP was to say that he did have connections with a girl  whether online or in person  then I'd say to get in contact with the cops right away  The dude has pictures you can find on fucking google that are   completely   legal  Then he has a few naked pictures that he possibly also found on Google  but needs help for   By your logic  all perverts are rapists  All pedophiles don't touch little kids like you see on tv and movies  All this scare tactic bullshit and generalized media got you thinking that way  No  It still doesn't make it right  He still needs to stop and get help  I'm not saying being a pedophile is okay  that's literally not what I believe  The dude needs to stop  and get help  He won't get that with the cops involved  All he'll get is a bunch of court dates  and then a slap on the wrists  He won't go to no federal prison for having one or five naked photos of children  He'll only get released only to do it again My parents eloped to Vegas without telling a soul  got married in blue jeans  Actually just had their 30th anniversary a couple days back   Congrats you two Do you want to you want to lose weight though  Or is it because someone else is telling you to  I think they're only telling you because they're making sure you're healthy enough to live  I'm sure they're not doing it out of just making you feel like shit and if you address that then they'll probably stop  If you want to lose weight  a big part of it is having will power to continue on pushing  I managed to lose 3 stone and I'm 6ft  For motivation  you shouldn't rely on it too much  Relying on motivation will help you for a limited time but it's ultimately down to you  A guy called MaxonFitness does a lot of body weight based excercise to help you lose weight and does tips to eat healthier  He's on YouTube and it's where I began before I started hitting the free weights  He even takes in suggestions if you can't find the right video  I'm not so sure there is  I'm not trying to argue with you  Just help you out  The complaints are only for your complaints on what advice I have given  I know some people aren't aware of their own nature  but you can't be wholly oblivious to it  I've given you plenty of food for thought  and if you look back in these comments   you'll find you answer  Have a good day Can you share more info about why it's too late  I dont think a cup contains high enough radiation to kill me that fast  but i'm afraid long term use of the cup might lead cancer or some kind illness  One case i've found in internet is clay product with glossy coating  with the coating releasing radiation that are not in the recommended doses  but that's it so far  Congrats man  Don't overthink things too much and you'll be just fine  Good luck in your future endeavors And they're not willing to a counseling session with her   Perhaps she can provide them with some reading that supports her diagnoses How high do you need to roll to get the Doritos  I'd be afraid of having to roll for anything because I seem to inevitably miss I have a horrible habit of checking texts then totally forgetting to respond  Don't always assume the worst  Try calling if you really want to get a hold of him  texts are too easily forgotten about  and not always on purpose  IMO  WhatsApp has the call feature  use it It's just going to rot anyway  It's a body    Blame seat belts and encourage people to motorbike  I would suggest meeting her elsewhere Well my family and I have had a dreadful year  but right now things are getting much better and prior to the party I had no worries going into the new year  I would have suggested that the reason I was so angry was due to emotions running high and having a stressful year  but the fact is that I've been very drunk before during far more stressful times and not shown the slightest signs of aggression   I'm extremely skeptical that my drink was spiked  but if it was  how would I know  Could I have a test done  Where at   I live in England  Even if I can get one done tomorrow morning it will have been 3 days since the party People with anorexia can  usually is  both hate their problem and be addicted to it  It's usual denial and try to covering up this problem for others  so even if he said it wasn't anorexia  maybe it still was   But   sure    maybe is something else  I am not one for holding back so my instinct says just tell him  the worst that can happen is he says no and its awkward for a while  If hes a true friend he will be able to move past the awkwardness and find flattery in it  If not it may ruin the friendship  but then it wasn't a very solid friendship in the first place  Biology gets in the way of that since people are horny af from like 12 years old Top 5 albums         Shapeshifter

yourself laterI can't say that I've given complaints though   I have given questions and explanations   Although I am gonna give one complaint and I'm sorry to say it   You still haven't answered my other question  what should I take responsibility for update Well since I'm trying to lose weight  I'd set it at least 15 idk  it doesn't really bother me  It's the same as saying "I was out with my parents" or "My brother and I   "  They're usually just setting the stage for the story they're going to tell by telling you who was there  It's probably more relevant when telling a story in person than when telling it on the internet  but people do that shit all the time You know I hear this al the time  I take a break and start in a year again going to school  The truth is al of this people never went back to school again   Like no one  so my best advice here is to do it right now  Go for it Get a hobby  get into counseling and link up with volunteer programs that cater to veterans  Don't let this spiral into something worse    First of all  do not feel guilty  You're only reacting to what happened from the perspective society has given you  Try to think of the experience from outside the narrow view you've been given  it was essentially two people enjoying each other in a perfectly normal way  Second of all  he should not have pushed you to go further than you wanted  You probably should have said no  but by all means don't feel bad about giving in because of what he will say to other people  Try to work through any feelings of betrayal or violation  but don't feel bad because of what some stupid high schoolers that you'll never see again in a few years will think  Trust me  people at my school have done way worse shit and within 2 weeks everyone has forgotten about it and it's old news  So just get through the first bit and you'll be all good  As I said though  he did push you too much and you were not comfortable  Unfortunately a lot of guys are like that  I'd recommend distancing yourself unless you feel that you can make him understand how you feel and that it's not right to push people beyond what they're comfortable with when it comes to intimate things like that  Good luck  Do you have any friends you can talk to  Even just finding s stranger online and venting like you just did might help  1995 22 2017  hey it works What do you mean by Cho US      Good work dude  Going on a second date with her A few options   1  Share reputable resources  NAMI  WHO  APA  etc  Perhaps borrow a DSM 5 from the library to read the sections on depression and anxiety including criteria and etiology    2  If you GF sees a therapist  have her ask about doing a psychotherapy session with her parents to learn about her diagnoses  The therapist may also be able to provide additional resources    3  If these people are resistant to becoming educated via the means above  I would strongly suggest limiting your time with and exposure to them as encourage your GF to do the same  People like this who deny the existence of something in the face of science and facts are endlessly frustrating to be around and as you said  counterproductive to her therapeutic progress  25 yearsI don't disagree with the general statement  that you have influence on your perception and that there's a way to work towards happiness  What i disagree with is your oversimplification of it  You didn't mention any practical tips  just random philosophical standpoints  All you said in your first comment was basically "just change it"  But that's not how change works  You don't just push a button and suddenly the emptyness inside you is filled with happy unicorns  It's a long way  And just listing a few pipe dreams doesn't help   There are however ways to work on it  And meditation can certainly be one of them  But people are different  Different lifes  different experiences  different problems  For some mediation may help  for others there may be other ways that work better for them  Telling people to "just be happy" is a bit cocky  And saying you know the solution for everyone's problems pretty pretentious not sure you have to pay a penny in support after 18No  she's not  which is why it's really hard  She has a bad memory and forgets what happened each day  If the pills did not give her any bad side effects  I would be for at least trying them  But it's really hard because she's not in the state of mind to say what she wants  We have to decide for her   Thanks so much for your words  Talking about it has helped a lot  Its just been bottled up since this November and it's hard when there's no one to talk to besides friends that get tired of hearing about it Mention it to your gf talk about it with her   she knows her sister the best after all right   I would feel just fine  as long as I was no longer being treated differently than other girls my age I'm 100  sure  He's the only partner I've had  So yeah  shitty question indeed That has got to be extra hard for you since he was young and it was sudden   My dad was very ill and had been dying for a long time  and was 75  and we all began grieving years ago   at least he knows that you care  There's a limit to what you can do if he doesn't want to talk unfortunatelyDon't rely on motivation all the time because when it's not there when you need it you begin to feel a little shittier about yourself  I'm sorry but I honestly don't know where to get motivation from  Because to be able to accomplish things in life and feel good about yourself requires you to have willpower  to keep on going  In short  willpower almost fuels your motivation  I also get bored of things very easily  but we're forced into a system where we're expected to do these specific things to make money  And that is literally the only reason as to why we all go to work every morning  It's not because we enjoy it  unless you got your dream job  but it's because we need to wake up every morning  catch a bus and work for an asshole of a boss to make some cash   It's good that you're pursuing the things you want to do  but I don't see any motivation in work  Whether that's Anna's thing for me or not  Wow    Spell check to 'Anna'  huh  Who the fucks Anna  I meant "Whether that's a bad thing for me or not" Four or five different basic mechanisms of actions in all cases  as I recall  Hypnotics and beta blockers included on top of anti Ds  Ps   Ms When you're in a social setting  Find an inaminate object  a lamp  a brick  a couch  or a wall  Feel it with all of your being  claim it  Name it  Become it   Now you have at least one friend to be open around He ruined his own future by getting you pregnantI doubt people in relationships don't feel unloved from time to time  that is to say   a poor relationship can leave a partner unsatisfied  unwelcome  and unloved  Thanks so much  It's hard  I try to play peacekeeper but a lot of the issues my uncles aunt mother has goes beyond and way before I was born  I try to just listen to everyone's side  At least we are coming together to help her in this though  Even if we are bickering   it's more of my mother venting and me trying to help her calm down   It's hard because she's not in the state of mind to decide that sort of thing  and while I don't have the final say  that goes to my grandfather   I do think that she would take quality over life NOW rather than some hypothetical situation down the road   It's just hard because I've been told most people tolerate the pills pretty easily   and I don't know how she would feel if she realized it was something that might make her feel crappy for 4 6 months but give her 3 5 more years   I just don't know   and my grandpa is old and it's so hard to know he had to make this decision    I feel selfish for wanting her to be here   but I don't want her to suffer  It's just   a horrible situation   Thank you so much to both of you that replied  writing all that down helped a lot Hi fellow NC friend  If you've been there for 3 months or more  give a 2 week notice  So you can put it on your resume  I worked at a place for a year and wanted my hard work to show up even though i hated the place  Those three criteria seem good  I give her full marks for eating  it's about the only thing she does enjoy these days   half marks for toilet  as she's soiling   wetting herself pretty frequently these days  and half marks for mobility since she's bumping into things  entirely lost in the dark  and exhausted by what used to be a short walk  2 0   3 doesn't sound like a bad score  but we can keep an eye on the situation You must be pretty good looking to nab a date out of Tinder that soon  Hopefully things go well for you If your phone alarm isn't loud enough you can buy a  'Traditional Alarm Clock' It has one of those metal pieces where they go  DING DING DING   Reallllly loud  My mom got one haha Why are you even browsing this sub if you feel complete and fulfilled without romantic connection     It seems delusional to pretend to be just fine when you are unable to experience this thing that pretty much everyone wants to have and most psychologists agree is very important for psychological wellbeing     There's nothing bitter about what I wrote and I am 'just dealing with it'   It sounds like you just got offended because you were trying to pretend everything was totally fine when it clearly wasn't   This image may apply to some people but it doesn't seem appropriate for this subreddit   Right   Fuck everything that has been said   I want you to read this   I had this written before I wrote my post   This is what I was thinking about sending C   "I don't want this to be awkward  but with it being the new year  I thought it best to stop holding grudges   In school  everything can be the same if that's what you want   You don't have to say anything to me   If you do want to start talking again  I'll let you have the first words   Truth be told  I'm not even expecting a reply to this  just as long as it's seen and I get it out of my system   I'm sorry for how things left off   From what I can remember  it ended with me just ignoring your message   I was angry  and I wanted time to think   It seems I just took too long on it   Now that I think back on it  it seems like it was anger over nothing   Looking at our final messages  I see that you had apologised for everything that had happened   I'm sorry that I was too blind to see that   I realise that you've most likely moved on from this  as it happened such a time ago   Let me tell you  I have to   But  as I said  with it being the new year  I don't want to be holding grudges anymore   Again  I'm sorry for what happened   And I'm sorry it had to end the way it did   And I'm sorry for the way that I got on about it   I know this should've been said a long time ago  and therefore it's probably meaningless  but still   I think it needs to be said "  Tell me what you think Go to bed earlier and if you got a messed up schedule do an all nighter than go to bed the next night at like 10pm It also has a lot to do with neets and a ton of people still living with their families despite working so hard too   There are also these things called boys bars and girls bars where people go to where they just talk to members of the opposite sex and that supposedly has something to do with it   Generally  with personal experience I would find it hard to believe that many Japanese people don't lose their virginity in their early 20s  27 is the prime marrying age   but I'm going off of what I've been told by Japanese girls     all those characters are very selfish people   Yeah  this happens a lot  I've posted about this before  " Look who I ran into while hanging out with my girlfriend of four years  " Come on  dude  we don't even know you  Why do we care that you were hanging out with your girlfriend when you saw somebody from a meme  I love all kinds of music  but I especially love music that makes good use of bass  I'd have to say metal is my favourite genre  but I'm very picky about it  I like jazz too   This is my favourite song  https   www youtube com watch v WIMyGT2AI8EI have to reassure you because to me you seem to be a very self aware person  It's quite normal at your age to find sustaining attention for long periods of time very difficult  You might find that as you mature and your skill set develops  and you get broader experiences to hook learning onto  you'll find content similar to what you're learning now  more interesting  Some of the high achievers you're comparing yourself to have naturally strong auditory memory  better attention span  or perhaps are generally more anxious than you are which may help them in staying motivated  for better or worse  I think the first thing you should do is give yourself permission to feel disappointed in your inability  so far  to perform the behaviours necessary for school achievement  Give yourself permission to be imperfect   we all are  Then  look to the qualities and attributes you've clearly already developed  It is a wonderful thing that you are self aware and mature enough to see your own shortcomings AND be able to go some way in explaining why you've repeated the behaviours  This is where your answer lies  You need to focus on building up your strengths  What do you excel in  We are so lucky in the 21st Century that there are so many career paths out there  If  say  you're really really good at sustaining your interest in computers or reddit or I don't know    something   examine what it is about that activity that lends itself to your strengths  Then have a good think and tap into the people and resources around you  to identify the sorts of places  people  and careers that match that  Your story isn't set in stone by anything that happens in high school  What matters most is whether you have the skill  persistence and self awareness to craft a life that allows you to give the best of yourself  You already have proven you have one of those three things  Chin up   P s  I'm a 30 yr old secondary school teacher in Australia Seems like a very unrealistic expectationI think your mention of exercise is a good one  Of course  it is all about motivation  If you're creative then you could try digital art  if you like computers   Maybe you like writing  Why not practice and then earn some extra cash by offering to write online  There are many areas to explore  Hope this helps But the fact that their girlfriends happened to be there is irrelevant to the story  That's the point Honestly it sounds like your friend is only thinking of himself  I mean  I know it sucks to have an expectation of something not met  especially when it comes to friends and plans not working out  But for real  it just kind of sounds really selfish  from what you've said here  He wants you to move so he can have cheaper rent and then when you have another plan he insults you   That sounds like a lot of shit that is happening on his end or in his head  Idk  maybe think about if the friendship is worth holding on to  Maybe moving in together wouldn't have been such a good idea  Idk  That's just how it came off to me  I listen to School Days  Changing Seasons and Want to be Close all day at schoolActually this doesn't work  unless your birthday is the 1st of January I am turning 17 on the 24th of January  I am surrounded by toxic and emotionally abusive people  My mental health is taking a deep dive and I am starting to feel physically ill because of it  chest pains   I'm not sure this is the right place to contact or whether there is support out there for me because I am getting older  School is starting tomorrow  I have good grades but this year I need to do better than ever  I'm afraid school puts too much pressure and too high of a work load for me  it's a private school   This might destroy the time and energy I have to handle my bad living situation  and deal with coping   It was not until a couple of days ago that I learned that I could be being emotionally abused  Lately  my dad has been nothing but mean to me  From sleeping in late  it's a badly needed vacation and never past 11  to overfilling a plastic glass with soda  or not mentioning that my dad was single to an older lady I was volunteering with  which is required by the school  These yelling fits usually last for an hour and ruin the day entirely  Where my dad will go to sleep and be in a terrible mood the entire day long  For all of my life I was told that it is the duty of the child to ensure that the parent is happy  I was always blamed for not planning summer vacations  for not setting him up with women  for not introducing him to other people   He feels impossible to talk to  I can't communicate with him  He has an image of me that he sticks by  He doesn't actually know who I am and doesn't care to listen to me when he is yelling  It's like talking to a wall  It's completely one sided  He says that I fail at everything  that I have not accomplished anything  that I have no life  and that it's not important whether I go to a good school  or get a good job  What is important is taking care of him  He is suicidal and threatens to leave me  He claims that he is no longer my parent  It should be added that he is bipolar  My mom also passed away when I was 3  He told me to consider myself an orphan and him rather a business partner  I could live with this if we were treated like equals  But I don't have the ability to go out when I want or to do as I want throughout the day   In April  of this year I fell in love with a girl  She was truly a blessing  she was kind  funny  and caring  She doesn't want to date  She doesn't want to be in a relationship  At first this was hard for me  but I've learned to appreciate that she is an awesome friend  It is complicated because we do talk about feelings for each other  we are sexually active  But her mental health has taken a drastic turn for the worse  She takes out her frustration and anger onto me  She's suicidal and some nights I fear that I'm losing her  She is distant and sometimes secretive  I love her and I vow never to let her suffer on her own  but it's hurting me too  I feel if I moved on from her I would be giving up and then she might finally go over the edge  I am still in love with her and times can be amazing for us  or miserable on a turn of a dime   My sister has two kids and a fiancé in Cape Breton  She is doing well  She came up to visit us for New Years  Everyone was there including my friend who I have feelings for  She played with my niece and nephew and she fit in great  Things were very happy  Only three or so days after that my dad is convinced that I am tearing this family apart  My brother an ex drug addict is 30 years old  He has moved back in with us after attempting to overdose to get help from the mental health portion of the hospital  They discharged him and brought him home to live with us  In my mind  he is not detrimental to my mental health whatsoever  However  we live in a 2 bedroom apartment and my dad offered to give up his bed  My dad I believe takes out a lot of his frustrations on to me   I am 17 years old which means university is right around the corner  I have good grades  88  average from a private school   Unfortunately  I am not sure if it's possible for me to go to university by myself  I would prefer to go through the Student Loan's route by myself to escape this toxic  and hostile living environment  My dad currently has it in his mind that I will be living with him until I am 25  Which means I will not be able to bring relationships over  or be independent for a very long time  However  my dad is a high income earner  This means that student loans may not be available to me  I am not even sure at this point if he will pay for my university  If I can't get his support  and I can't get a loan I will not be able to go to university   I am sending this message while my dad is still angry with me because I slept in after 9 today  School begins tomorrow  Which is a heavier workload on top of the fact that I need to prepare my own meals  iron my own uniforms  for school  and deal with the constant emotional abuse  My very close friend which I have feelings for is dreading the return of school as well  She has gone out for "a while"  nor will she tell me where she is going  She has also lost her phone for the night for some reason  and says this is a great thing so she will be able to think things over  I am thinking suicide  this is because I told her she was making me feel uncomfortable with one of her jokes  I am considering ending things myself  but I don't want to die   This is a hard life  Because I couldn't read it with the formatting What a nasty mean person she is  I'm so sorry for your pain  She doesn't deserve you exerting that pain for her though  Don't worry about it  I was afraid I'd be judged but literally everyone is different   Just avoid being in your room and try staying in the kitchen   communal area  the more you are around them the easier it gets  You just really have to go out of your confront zone which was the most difficult bit  but it was worth it We lived together for college last year but I am not attending now so I have no real reason to move up other than getting out of home  We are very good friends and I have struggled to build close friendships so I feel a lot of pressure and anxiety over possibly losing the friendship  I needed this bit of truth  Thank you Only until the buyer pays off the price agreed upon  then he she will own the title  You should break up with her My sister has IBS I think  I'm sure there are recipes out there that vary a good mixture of foods that you can eat e g a low fodmap fish curry with soothing spices   The IBS network helps a bunch with food Forgot they did that too    Turkey  I'm 20 as well and I've only seen one person near my age who's engaged  Ive always been told that on average people tend to get married after they've graduated from University and have a job or something along those lines  So yeah  around 25 is probably the norm Jheeez I'm just like you  I have friends and I can make new ones easily  I have people come up to me on the street just to start up a conversation  Apparently I'm approachable  But it's just girls  Never had sex or had a girl like me  To my knowledge Try and find a good mix  I'm a senior in high school and struggled a bit my first year until I found a good balance of games  homework  social life  etc    1  Always make sure your school work is done and then study whatever you didn't fully understand  Spend a little time after that studying for upcoming tests  2  Work out  Exercise is great  Not only does it make you feel better  but you'll sleep better and look better  My school has a program right after school that I go to  so look into what your school has to offer  Plus playing games after working out doesn't make you feel bad about lying around because you exercised already  3  Enjoy your hobbies  Reading  Read until you don't feel like it anymore  MTG do whatever you do  Enjoy it  If you don't fully care for video games don't be afraid to let these other hobbies and others mentioned cut into them  4  Games  Set an allotted time for them  but only if you get schoolwork and other priorities done  Whatever you wanna play enjoy it  5  Social life  Make sure you don't let other things get in the way of friends  I can think of too many time where I decided to play games instead of hanging with friends and I regret it    Enjoy high school  be social  take care of your body and mind  Games are ok just don't let them take over and get in the way of your social life or health There's really no question to this  you have to tell him that you're pregnant  It's his child too  he's obligated to know he's having a child just as you are too  It wouldn't be fair for you or him    hat's what I'd attempt to do    go to book talks and university calendar events  learn to do interesting stuff alone  It helps actually giving an impression of a memorable person   Volunteer for a good cause you're interested in   You'll meet nice people and you'll keep yourself busy so you'll feel a little bit better Hopefully  Good luck out there that's what i'm currently working on doingI'm sorry man  it will pass  Was he partaking in the weed as well  If so  he's guilty too  Either way  remember it will blow over  You're the fucking man No  don't get upset over petty stuff Nope  Nope  Nope  If they can't afford to buy you out with cash or get a car loan to buy you out  they are not credit worthy  There is a reason  Car loans are crazy easy to get and if they don't qualify for one  their credit is complete garbage  Counting on them to make the payments is a fool's game  something will come up  and the car will be repo'd under your credit  If there is some legal reason that they can't have assets  then you might be committing a crime if you "sell" them the car without registering that with the state  Also  they need insurance  and if they can't afford a car  an insurance company might not sell them insurance anyway  they do a credit check   Finally  if everything else were fine  selling a big thing like a house or car to a friend relative can destroy your relationship since they may feel you cheated them if something major goes wrong within a year or two  They may believe you "owe" them for a new transmission if it blows 6 months after the sale     This will more than likely end badly for you  Basically  unless you can afford to give them the car as a gift  you need to sell it for cash to someone else and let your friend relative get a loan and buy their own car from a neutral party  I pm'ed you  I'm so sorry for your loss   That has a 1  chance of being cute and a 99  chance of total cringe As a manager  I would totally recommend putting one in  What employers do with two week notice is this    If you put two week in  you are considered rehirable  If you DO NOT give one  often you're not rehirable  This is what employers use if a new prospective employer of yours calls them for reference    When employers contact each other  HR departments  if intelligible  wojt actually give a "he was great  he was lazy" answer  They avoid these due to possible slander suits etc   So they use rehirable vs not  If not rehirable  this is consider the negative review of the former employee  I guess so  but at least he knows  essentially me and a close friend of mine worked on a project together  but submitted pretty different final copies with just a somewhat similar project topic  the prof saw the similarities and emailed us both asking to meet  and we pretty much knew what the email meeting was about so we met up before hand to talk over our strategy for dealing with our respective meetings with the professor  we decided that there was no way he could conclude that we worked on the project together if we both just denied the fuck out of it  and that that was our plan  so for the last 2 3 weeks ive been denying everything this prof is accusing me of  only to find out a few days ago  when i was told im getting kicked out  that the whole time my friend has been telling the prof the truth about the fact that we worked together and as a result the prof just thinks i've been stupidly bullshitting to his face  which i guess i was  all this stuff about how i'm innocent and how we didnt work on the project together  and he  the prof  subsequently got the dean to kick me outI have similar self conscious issues but I actually loudly backtalked my neighbour for being obnoxious once  so I guess I all I can say is  I was an asshole and my neighbour shouldn't pay it any mind  and neither should you   And just becuase I thought he was annoying then doesn't really change what I think about him now  I still interact with him in the same way as I usually do when I stumble into him and I perfectly accept whatever he does with his life  I am no master of it and my judgements mean nothing else that I have authority issues   Really  whatever you neighbours think or say they're coming from some kind of selfish ignorant place    pay it no mind and prove to them their prejudice doesn't mean anything by being yourself and remain unfazed by their opinions of you Female here  and yes  my thoughts are just as sick and twisted  They have been that way since I could think  And it's only about men guys facing torture rape    Any book suggestions  btw The problem is that it becomes costly whereas jut eating anything could be easy  time efficient and decently priced  So yes  I could technically make a piece of chicken with rice but that leaves me with no flavor or satisfaction  If I start buying all of these extra things to flavor it my food cost goes up  Consent in this case is questionable  given that she was inebriated   I wouldn't class him as a rapist  but he is absolute slime for taking advantage of the fact that she was drunk   And then to brag about it on top of that    Yeah  he took advantage of her  so he's an utter piece of shit Not sure if I fully explained myself or I didn't understood your reply  Indeed  the idea of taking a break while still in school is tempting  almost 90  people don't wanna go back either because they found a job or simply can't be arsed    But I was talking about after graduating  I have no idea what to do after graduating so I was wondering if taking a break is a good idea at all Seems kinda rapey  I would definitely say that constitutes as "trauma"  Maybe see a therapist  Especially if this is a "good" guy and doesn't push the issue on you  Either way  probably have some stuff you need to get worked out  best of luck  I definitely understand how you feel  I've been in similar situations  The only thing is that someone who cares about your feelings wouldn't call you out the way he did over having doubts  Man this makes me so angry  They're not only endangering themselves but others tooLike I said  it probably only appeals to weirdos like me Accept feeling awkward  Put yourself out there and practice speaking with others  Try to get involved more with other things and so you'll meet groups of people in a similar environment where you're all interested in the same thing  Don't think about it too much  No one will give a shit if you ask to repeat a question or something  Practice doesn't make perfect but you'll be pretty good at it after time  The only way to deal with this is by forcing yourself in these situations you're not comfortable in and as time passes you'll get used to it  If you're confident around people you know  try to bring them into public places more often and hang out with them  You'll get used to other environments you're not used to Thank youThank youYou should get them a sleep study  If it's sleep apnea it'll help both of you sleep much better and possibly prolong both of your livesOoooh yeah that'd make me mad too  Tell them that what they do with the characters on their own time is their business  but you need to get what you paid for yeah  they live across the street  me and her and her brothers and sisters were all close before my health went south years ago  my social life fell apart after that  Unfortunately sometimes a biproduct of depression truly is laziness   I think it's important to recognize when your close friends or just friends are being slouchy and watching tv in their bed the entire day because they're depressed but at a certain point or after prolonged periods you also have to call laziness  becuase depression allows it and it's a secretly attractive quality for those who are depressed themselves  which is why I believe it's a good thing when people try to get you out of your rut by telling you to man up If you're not good enough for anyone  there will always be someone not good enough for you    and when you meet them  you can either become their mate or motivate yourself to become a better person they served me with a notice "of requirement to withdraw from the university" and they're gonna put an academic misconduct thing on my transcript which basically makes it impossible to transfer or anything as far as I understand  from what the prof told me in the email where I was served with the notice    apparently this academic misconduct thing is a huge deal  no university will touch you and it stays on your record for 25 years where I'm from  ontario  canada   i have one semester left of school  so 5 courses and yeah my parents have about  30K  35K in student loans left to repay on top of the   40K they've put in up for living expenses and stuff   i also detailed why im getting kicked out in a reply to a comment above  thanks a ton for any advice you can give a man  im so lost  and what do you mean by professional help  like a counselor Totaly agree  maybe even smartphones should get some kind of function to prevent people from doing stuff like this I'm sorry if I sounded harsh before  I'm an oncology nurse so I have seen this scenario play out many times  Is there a medical power of attorney or has she ever made her thoughts known   I'm so sorry you're going through this  Cancer is hard to watch and I can't imagine how it feels being the one who has to think about those decisions  All the best for you and your grandma  Well  you can't starve to death  Although my sister  does  just live of popcorn and marhsmellows  I think spending more money on new and interesting things is better than not having anything at all and live of snacks  Sorry I'm unable to help About the books  I stoped reading for years  and now I started again by using e books on my phone  You just need to download an e pub reader app on your phone  you can get one free from android store  and download whatever you like     You could even read comics for a start  but that needs another app and depends on your screen how easily you could read them life is so cruel like that  I hope the drunk driver got punished been seriously considering joining the military  as far as I can tell thats the only real option for me to take   it would let me get away from my parents  who after I tell them are gonna be completely devastated  which they should be  this is a massive fuck up by any standards   as well as provide me with a way to regain discipline and hopefully pay for school afterwards if its at all possible for me to attend any universities in the future  that being said if I told anyone I was joining they would laugh me off for hours  I'm not the type at all and don't know if I would survive in that atmosphere  I wake up late  am generally pretty undisciplined  enjoy coasting by in life I get sleep paralysis all the time and there doesn't seem to be a correlation in how I'm lying and the frequency of sp  I wish there was because I hate sleep paralysis   No loans  Make them pay in full Aww congrats  You should be proud of yourself and of course best of luck with everything That's my suspicion  too  Everyone around these parts put tubes in their kids' ears and took out the tonsils after a few bouts with strep   I know it can be dangerous  A friend lost her brother to strep that spread to his heart  Yeah  I'm not very aggressive with it  but people just stop wanting anything to do with me after week one  That's why I take it so badly no  you didn't sound harsh at all  It's something that's very valid and serious to think about  It's ultimately up to my grandfather   I think my grandma would want to try something if she thought it would help and the effects were short term   nothing more than that though    I can't say for sure    it's really hard  She keeps asking what happened and why she was away    Thanks for your kind words It's mainly because I had agreed to move but I've recently been ok with living at home and looking for a job You seem to be very hung up on the weight gain side effect  You do know that it's not like you gain a huge amount of weight  and if you for some reason did then you would bring it up and likely they would change the medication    I actually lost weight from taking Mirtazapine   it very much depends on your body and how it works Thanks man  means alot to me that you heard me outWell its your Child and you have been supporting it for 18 years I guess you wouldnt let it go to the trashcan that easily you know Thanks  This post was mostly inspired by a friend of mine who  as his New Year's resolution  is going to be phasing out video games entirely  He's extremely self aware  but is into some strange things  astral projection  sleep paralysis   He runs a lot  and is decently well informed on issues and philosophy   He has some issues as well  namely insecurity and a not so great home   I'm probably going to do what you said  but tone down my playing of Overwatch anyway  It's fun  but there are other productive things that I could do with my time  Still  it's nice to play it once and a while  just not several hours a day  You're right  it is the one that I enjoy  and has a great community   Thanks I'm sick of hearing this   If you have a baby face with a weak jawline  it will look just as bad   Shaving only works if you have the genes for it If you have any left  cut them in half and take them for a few more days  Make sure you drink more  water  than usual  Get off all caffeine  No coffee  no Coke  no Monster  no Red Bull  B 12 and vegetables  Detox diet  NOT kidding  Yup i've noticed this too   Even from my own family     People don't need to remind us we're losing our hair   we fucking know already yeah  thanks for the advice i really hope they are as I know I have to tell them asap  im just so scared that they wont be  they were never really understanding in the past when I didnt get grades they considered to be good enough  or when my swim times were worse than they thought they could be   the thing is even if they do understand it will change my entire families perception of me  as i said they all expect me to become a prestigious doctor  and i dont know if they'll ever look at me the same way again  which I dont know if i can take      It is good that you didn't  I'm sure you'll find a better person in your life who will treat you better and appreciate you more than someone who cheated on you weekly  This may sound disgusting and so it should  would you really want his dick inside of you when it was just in his sisters not long ago I think there's that now infamous study that shows men ranked all kinds of women high but the opposite was not true   Women rank men lower  in general   It's never a bad idea to have that talk    it's probably nothing   but I would mention it to your gf   same way you ask Reddit  You can trust her Most colleges offer free psychological counselling please take advantage of it while you can because otherwise it can be very expensive  I greatly regret not taking advantage of free mental health services  I spent all 5 years of university without friends and suicidal She invited him to come over while she was drunk and then went with it  She "doesn't think" she would have done it sober  and is embarrassed    To me it seems like she got fucked up  wanted a hook up  called a guy over that liked her  did it  then regreted doing it because people found out  The one thing I do know is your friends are the real pieces of work for throwing around the word "rapist" when it's this open ended  You're welcome  It's just my own opinion but  I'd wager it's pretty close to accurate  I will consider your advice  I'm new to reddit so  I am still finding my way around     Could you possible recommend some appropriate subreddits Thank you for posting to  r helpmecope  While you wait for users to post and help you  please take a look at  the Wiki page  http   www reddit com r helpmecope wiki index  that contains many different coping techniques and strategies    Thank you  again    r helpmecope team   I am a bot  and this action was performed automatically  Please  contact the moderators of this subreddit   message compose  to  r helpmecope  if you have any questions or concerns  And  judging from their replies to other people who did attempt to engage  definitely the best response  This is not somebody interested in a discussion Hopefully so  I'm not exactly happy atm  but I Hope you're feeling better I'm strongly considering getting a chin implant in a few years when I have more spending money  Anyone here have any experience with that  Lots of mixed reviews online If I'm picking the music  it usually degenerates into soulless techno peppy dance pop that ultimately gets on my nerves   So I prefer to be taken on a journey by a radio dj   Discovered Prince Rama this year and I really  really enjoy them DecPretty much all metal  Everything from stoner  High on Fire  The Sword  Electric Wizard  to death metal  Cannibal Corpse  Allageon   to groove metal  Pantera  Lamb of God    Lately I've been listening to a lot of atmospheric black metal  Cairiss  Winterfylleth  Coldworld  Deafheaven  Ghost Bath  because the anguish in that sort of music speaks to me  Imperium Dekadenz is one of my favs right now Thanks for the response  Exercise is one of the things that my parents have somewhat pressured me to do  as my dad said  half jokingly  that I need to "bulk up "  I'm somewhat skinny  no matter how hard I try  Based on my habits  like stress eating and somewhat bad diet  I should be fat  but somehow I'm not  It's strange   I'm glad that there's a community center within walking distance  so I will probably frequent that more often   On your point on social life  that probably won't be much of an issue  I'm not the most social person  and in addition to being awkward towards strangers and acquaintances  basically anyone I don't know really well   I have quite a small friend group  Luckily  three of them live very close to my house  which we only realized later  I'm glad that cutting these time consuming activities  that in hindsight I realize that I didn't like that much  will allow me to spend more time with them  and improve my social skills    Thanks for your response Stop encouraging her to get an abortion  She has obviously considered this already and doesn't want one  Jesus Christ   OP he does deserve to know if you're going to have the baby  It's his responsibility as much as yours  you shouldn't have the full burden alone    Good luck  you're in my thoughts Where are you moving from  I wouldn't even waste time explaining anything  Just cut her off entirely If you're bald  being shredded is not optional     Unless you want to rock a sickly look or look like a neo nazi Yeah  it does kinda suck but I've picked up hobbies I can enjoy alone to make the most of it  No sense it letting it bring me down too much  sometimes you just roll with the punches  Best of luck to you  I do have to say that I respect the guy for going back to his family and raising them   He could have just left and ignored his wife and kids and had any girl he wanted  not that his wife is unattractive     Looked through his Instagram too and he seems to care for his kids   Thanks for the e book tip  I did read a lot more when I was younger  which is one of the reasons why I didn't have to study for English class  However  as I progressed through grades and ended up having to carry binders  books  and folders all across the school  my middle school had a messed up policy saying that we couldn't use bags  and we could only use our lockers before and after lunch  and at arrival and dismissal   bigger  heavier books became cumbersome and I read less and less  Thanks for this  It'll help give me something productive to do in between classes Prepare whilst moving or prepare to how England is gonna be  If it's to how England is gonna be make sure to check up on the laws on such things but I'm sure you've already have  Yeah I can try calling them and see what their recommendation is  I might just get bounced around to another doctor but at least I'll have a starting point I assume your hesitation stems from the fact that you want to maintain the friendship  yes    While that is certainly reasonable  you also have to take yourself into account  If you repress your feelings for any longer  it will come back to bite you in the arse down the line  In fact  it won't just bite you in the arse  It will explode in your face while a holographic 50's broadway cast ironically starts breaking into song as your dismembered body parts rain on them     Okay  that might have been overtly gruesome  The point is  you have to care about yourself too  When you tell him about it  you have to tell him that you're mostly doing it for yourself  So that you may not go bonkers with the lingering "what if" in your head      That's just my 2 cents though  Best of luck to you  I know how hard it can be  But know that everything passes  even heartbreak  Be brave  OP Thanks for your response  I'm lucky to be within walking running distance of a community center  so I can easily exercise on their equipment  I might also continue writing through journaling  a practice that my dad said helped him quite a bit through his college years  It'll also give me something to laugh at when I'm older  Thanks I think that if I were to really force myself to work at it  I could probably get a date eventually  Maybe it would take getting in better shape  new clothes and going out every weekend or online dating platforms  I am sure I would be rejected plenty  but after 2 3 months of determined effort maybe I could get a date    But those first rejections scare the hell out of me  and even more terrifying the prospect of actually having to go on a date I understand it is irrelevant sometimes  but it's the most  natural  way of expressing a story for the overwhelming majority of people  When someone tells about an experience  they usually start the story with where they were and who they were with  That's all that's happening  People don't naturally speak concisely and optimally  There's even a Mark Twain quote about it    The point you missed from my post was that it was to offer an explanatory possibility for OP's  true  observation in contrast with what the rest of the thread currently offered  which had to do with ego boosting  After all  if you accept that relationships are normal for normies it should follow that there's nothing to gloat about with respect to having a relationship  I wouldn't be surprised if there's an egotistical aspect to it for some people  but I wouldn't make it a blanket statement  Regardless of where her parents are  where is  she  on the  five stages of therapeutic recovery  http   pairadocks blogspot com 2015 12 the five stages of recovery html   If she is not at stage three  and is under 18  you're up against the Alabama Crimson Tide defense    I will be

her behalf  But that  will  be costly  as well as relationship wrecking with them    I understand you love her  but her culture will not be fun to deal with if you get married   My cousin found this out three years ago when she got engaged to one    and walked away before the ceremony   Thank you  I agree that many people believe that having children makes it harder to solve financial issues  The fact is whether you have children or not  it is equally difficult to solve your own money problems sometimes  I am hoping for more donations as well  Our check engine light just came on tonight       When you have to be in charge of people  you do lose a bit of that camaraderie  You have to decide whether the benefits described are better than what you have currently  Most likely being in a supervisory position will help you with other retail jobs as well    Make sure they aren't just tagging you with the management label so they can avoid paying you overtime   It's gotta be a pretty terrifying situation  For you  not knowing everything that happened and for your boyfriend  wondering if you've secretly hated him all this time   I'm not trying to upset you  but I'd probably think that in this situation   Try to stay calm and explain that that's not who you are  But at the same time take accountability for it  It'll be tough but I hope things work out Miss I relate to you on a good deal on that stuff     Nothing is wrong with you  I've had that same problem for years on end  and it's been dying down since the last 2 months because I've been chatting with someone who's taught me so much  whether directly or indirectly  Now I'm more patient with finding the love compared to before    Love is amazing and I'm positive you will find it someday  just like I will  You will find that person who you connect with on such a deep level  I'm young too  almost 19  and I've had all those thoughts  To the point where it was collapsing my mental infrastructure  even with what I believed to be "maturity"  As someone who's been told he's an old soul a lot  let me help you with what I've taught  And maybe we both could learn more with a good back and forth   First off  that person you will love doesn't just spontaneously fall on your plate  It has to be worked for over time  with patience and truthfulness  Let me explain  You are searching for the love of your life  right  Well how will you know that person is the one  By some clingy  desperate emotions  or by spending a good deal of time with them  becoming their friend  and becoming their SO   and they your SO  Despite what you may think  and what I've thought  the emotions may bind you fast  but it's up to you to figure out if that bind is make of hope or of true love   Secondly  being selfless may seem like the right thing to do  but for the most part it does more harm than good  Patience is needed  as is an open mind  and willingness  But if you have to change who you fundamentally are  that's not love  that's desperation  If you are ever in doubt  remember the best relationships have communication  If you can't open up to this person  and or share any problems  doubts  or insecurities  or if that person makes you feel worse afterwards  then most likely that is not a worthwhile relationship    I don't believe that it's kindness holding you back from ending it  I believe it's your hope and fear  Hope that maybe the relationship can get better  and fear because of what you will lose if it ends    Your sensitivity is a beautiful thing  I have it too  and though it's a double edged sword  it helps because it makes us more human  More loving  compassionate  but also more vulnerable and possibly self sacrificing  In my opinion  once you start to learn more about to yourself  like I am   it's absolutely worth it   You won't need to try your hardest  though effort might be needed  it should mostly flow naturally    It's not that there is something wrong with you  You just haven't met the person who suits you yet  I feel I get overly attached and possibly super clingy  and I find I have to work on that  but it's not necessarily a bad thing  I'm just working on it because it hurts me emotionally getting too attached  Maybe you need to work on it too  I don't know    In fact  I don't know you  I'm just speaking off experience and off what you said  So if I'm getting anything wrong  don't take it to heart  But I believe  unless you choose not to work on yourself and build more character  that who you are now will change over time  You're 18  and  especially I'd you're going to college  you'll undergo a lot of change over these next few years  just like I will  But even so  who you fundamentally are  from what you're saying  makes you seem like an amazing person  but this person is quite vulnerable and possibly insecure  And to get past insecurities  you need communication  change  and acceptance    Don't feel humiliated  New Years day is generally like every other day  but people choose to celebrate it and make it seem more valuable than it appears  You may be sad  and that's ok  but whatever day he broke it off on  it was his own choice and you'll recover  However he feels about you shouldn't matter anymore  You need to focus on what's ahead  and how you see yourself  He is now the past  and you have a whole future without him  It may hurt to hear that  but if he isn't for you then that's a good thing  What you're feeling isn't love for him  it's the idea of loving someone and being loved that you yearn for    Him bringing in religion to your relationship doesn't seem like a wise choice  It was his own doing  Even if it wasn't  if he made you feel bad using it  I or tried to control you  or whatever other bad things with it  then it's good that you are now free from him   I regret my first and only relationship because I clung to the first girl who seemingly showed a hint of interest in me  And she was completely toxic to me  I had to break it off as I couldn't bear that pain constantly  But I admit  despite the regret  that I learned a lot from that relationship  I found more of who I am and what I want  And what to look for in someone as well    I have that void just like you do  But it's only temporary  The fight for something better and the desire to be happy are slowly enveloping the pain of loneliness and making life seem not so bad  You don't need to move on right away  Mature up more  Maybe you handle most situations better than others  but just like me  we need to be more emotionally prepared and build more of ourselves before we can truly be fit for a true and long relationship    You went wrong by letting your emotions guide you  But  even though that may seem like entirely wrong  you've learned a little bit  whether you know it or not    That's really the only wrong though  Nothing else was your fault  it was just nature taking its course  Were you toxic  Did you not try  Were you unfaithful  No  Nothing wrong   You will find true love  I'm in the same place as you  but i know that if I work for the future I want  and put in all the effort I can  I will get the future I desire  You can too  you just need to work hard on improvement and understanding  keep up the effort  and have develop a strong mind that can stay on the right path  despite the struggles   If you need to chat with someone  feel free to pm me  I'm pretty open as far as I know  and not judgmental  But  if you message me  that's for you to truly determine and find out   Othewise  i wish you the best of health and fortune  Good luck and have happy times Don't walk   run  Run away girl  Yep  For the first time in my school experience  probably due to a lack of study habits  my grade  in Spanish  has dropped to a C  Of course it's Spanish  the one class that has zero retakes  late work  and a teacher that literally works the class through rigid routines that are exactly the same for every unit  Hopefully if I develop study habits now  I won't screw up in college  which is probably more impactful than high school   Thanks Its okay  Thanks for trying though Honestly  just ignore the  Continue to challenge yourself  but only as much as you think is truly beneficial  Also  start hanging out with friends  Just do it  Study with them or something  Hang out with them on the weekends  There is value to learning how to interact with others and you're not getting that Nobody on here can give you an all inspiring answer to this one fella  there is no quick fix    All I can say is this  some of the most beautiful  interesting people I know  still don't know what they want to truly do or be  Maybe they never will  I'm 29    Further to the above  a lot of people my age are still asking themselves the same questions you are so eloquently asking yourself now  including me    Your life is your life  it may be mediocre from the perspective of a young rockstar but it may also look awesome from the perspective from a kid in care etc       The fact that you're even asking yourself these questions means you'll be fine  you may even be pretty damn successful  That may happen when your 25 it may not happen until you're 55 but it will    Don't beat yourself up  You have a shit load of time  trust me you don't want to waste it doing that  Nobody gets it easy    Best of luck to you  I really mean that     not easy at all   Damn if it makes you feel any better I doubt the girl took it as sexual assault  I'm a lady and me and a guy friend usually go around trying to touch as many butts as possible at parties  which we never keep a running total  He would sometimes take it a step further and go for kisses on the cheek  I think it's good that you realized your actions could be taken the wrong way  but you instantly stopped when you saw you crossed a boundary and the fact you think you fucked your year up with such a small actions shows you care and won't make this mistake again   But don't worry too much  I'm sure she has forgotten by now and if not a light apology next time you see her might do you some good A lot of veterans have this problem from what I've heard    Try to find some constructive  rewarding job  maybe kitchen work if you are only entry level employable  Keeps you VERY busy   where you can achieve something and move up career wise if that's what you're looking for    Maybe you could take on a project like building something  A computer     An engine     A model car     Something that will keep your mind on "working" instead of being anxious   I don't know the trauma and anxiety from the battlefield but I was held up in my home during a robbery  that and the court case has cause me a lot of stress  when I don't want to deal with things anymore and start losing my grip on reality and "normal behavior" I take objects around me and think of as many adjectives I can to describe them   i e  "The blanket is fluffy  blue  soft   The ground is hard  wooden  brown  shiny   " Just something to distract yourself from overthinking      Another thing that has helped me is my faith   It isn't for some people  and everyone finds theirs in a different way but the teachings of Jesus are something I and some others may find comfort in   "The Sermon On The Mount" are some passages I often go over when I am feeling not so hot  It's a very positive thing to read when everyone and everything else seems negative   Sending positive vibes and wishes    Here's hoping you feel better and find something that brings you peace and happiness in this following year  If not this year than one of the following  some day it will happen and it will be wonderful     I think what you need most of all is validation for your pain  I would suggest to talk to an adult  teacher maybe   who could join you to talk to your parents  if they somehow dont belive you  then seek help on your own elsewhere  There is a chance you could use it  its better to be on the safe side you know  Whatever you do it will probably be hard  but i hope you still will take some kind of action to be happier   Good luck and take care buddy   I appreciate that  thank you That's the standpoint that I try to take with it too  I'm on vyvanse  When I started the vyvanse in my last year of high school  I still remember snacking a lot through out the day and eating a good sized lunch  But when I went to college  that's where it tapered down quite a bit  Thank you for the advice     Are you fucking kidding me   Don't pay her   and don't be friends with her anymore  Love is just a feeling and it can go away any second  They do not know how to react nor how is it possible  I'm the favourite child  so they've always expected high of me Yeah  They might be lying about their bank balance as well  A hobby you could do alone could help  You get the time to explore yourself   and   enjoy spending time with yourself  well said  thanks for the advice Talk  To  Your  Wife   You guys need open communication  She can't expect you to read her mind  but you can't expect to flail around silently and then blame her completely  You need to make your needs known just like her  It's childish to just give up on snowboarding because you're afraid of your wife It's cold here  So cold  I dont know either but years ago i used to have this  I could eat at home with family only  anyone else no chance  My family never ate out at all when i was young  besides saturdays at my nans house if that counts  and i remember when i was about 13 at a cousin's wedding i couldn't eat the food  I couldnt physically put it in my mouth as my hands were shaking so much and i was terrified of what people thought  I have absolutely no idea what made me feel like this that day but it stayed with me for so long  I agree  luckily my girlfriend and I are on the same page when it comes to unexpected childrenIt's not selfish and it's good and healthy to occasionally vent  Tough love is all I gotta

you're trying  It's best to say this to him  And explain that you have things to do too Try this app called "Sleep Cycle" Wow that's terrible of them  It sounds like you need a lock for your room There is always adoption  How would you feel if your parents aborted you  Maybe they should have Become who you want to be  Social person  Make a point to get to know people around you  Athletic  Practice more than your peers  workout  eat well  You get the point I get you  I worked so damn much until I started playing video games  Now I never wanna work again and happy to stay that way    O Those of us who don't see abortion as a moral issue find it offensive that some people make it into a moral issue  So there's nothing wrong with trying to remove the moral stigma from abortion if you don't believe it's a moral issue   It's a medical procedure that gives women more freedom to choose their own fate and not let strangers choose for them  Also  most of you who are against abortion also have no interest in helping people out once they give birth to children who were accidentally conceived Why would I break up with me and my girlfriendOnly if you have another job lined up thats better  I quit a job a while back and spended a month doing absolutely nothing except spending money on useless shit  Biggest waste of time ever  Say something along the lines of "You see these  No look closer  There's something really hidden well in the fingertips  Really well  No I won't poke your eye  Just look  I promise " And then when they look just jab them in the eye  Not hard enough to blind them  But just enough to let them know not to fuck with you  I'm really into sports cards and kids used to give me shit  So I learned card throwing and started bringing shitty ones that were worthless to school with me and every time someone said anything I would fling one at them  One time I got a poor sap in the neck and he bled  Just fuck with them  They give you shit  give it back two

know a guy who is 21 and beginning to bald  He used to be my next door neighbor and we grew up together  Last time I saw him I hadn't seen him in a year and thought he buzzed it on purpose and ran my fingers through where his hair used to be  I am still cringing from doing the most douchey thing possible the moment I saw him  But he's still the same person I grew up with and despite looking much older he's still an attractive guy  It will get much easier the older you get  and like the top poster said  plenty of girls find bald headed men extremely attractive  When you find someone they won't be with you just for your "young and attractive" years and genuinely love you as a person  Most men bald eventually  so you might as well use these years to love yourself and keep working towards your future  Seriously if any girls writes you off instantly for your lack of hair than good riddance  You are so much more than that and I know you'll find someone who sees you and loves you for who you are  Good luck and I hope you have a great 2017 Need more information  What was the lie and what was the reason I did make it in  I have to call and schedule a consult  which will likely be weeks away but it's a step in the right direction I don't think it's that you're trying to fit in I I believe that you just have enough dignity to not want to have a relationship where it's just about sex  The guy purely wants you for sex  that is no relationship  I'd seriously recommend a trip to the psychiatrist  what you're experiencing may be a form or schizophrenia and i'd recommend getting it checked

is not new and is as common as bread and milk   you're experiencing heartbreak  There are many reasons why heartbreak feels so bad  Someone we were close to and relied on emotionally is no longer available for us  On top of that  there's a strong feeling of rejection  where you mistakenly believe that because he didn't want to continue with the relationship  for whatever reason  that's really not yours to know   that there's somehow something wrong with you  there's absolutely not   I had one major experience of heartbreak  I'm married now  and I got myself through it this way    remember that  right now  there is a lovely kind eyed man out there  going through his life  laughing with his friends  caring for his pet  making his dinner  who will stand beside you and provide you with so much companionship  He is real and he is there  somewhere  He rang in 2017 a few days ago  just like you did  You'll bump into him eventually  and whether you decide to spend your lives together or not  he will love you and be your friend    experiencing heartbreak is such a grounding human experience  This experience is something that almost everyone can share  It will help you to become a better partner  and one day  perhaps  a caring parent who will be able to counsel a heartbroken child through the same experience perhaps    remember that it's not your job to negotiate your former partner back  He has done the honourable thing   been honest about his feeling   even if it meant putting himself through pain  clearly evident in the way he couldn't watch your hurt when you were crying  I had to do this once  break up with a guy I loved  It was extremely difficult  but I did it for both of us because I knew we were doing each other an extraordinary injustice staying together  We've both moved on to healthier  happier relationships and I'm so proud that we were able to part ways  Some people don't and instead drag one person or both people through a lifetime of misery  Try your best to see that he has done the honourable thing because he is a good man    practise self care  Do not fall into the trap of negative self talk  How you talk to yourself during this time will prove just how good a friend you are to your own heart  Do not extrapolate this experience to mean there's something wrong with you or that you did anything wrong  That is simply untrue  Get out and about  Have a coffee with a friend and ask her about her little universe  Watch stand up comedy on Netflix  Aziz Ansari is always good   Try not to ruminate too much   if you catch yourself analysing again and again  going in circles  do something with your hands  Get a friend over to help you clean out your kitchen cupboards  Find a whole bunch of stuff to sell on Gumtree  Just stay busy    remember that time will heal how you feel   Take care   Meredith So true  It's good to be kind to others  but you have to remember that some people will mistake your kindness for weakness  Others may not thank you when they should  or appreciate your selfless acts  If you're nice to others and don't have expectations as to how they'll respond  you might find that instead of feeling constant disappointment  you'll find a deeper appreciation and bond with those who treat you kindly in return  Assertiveness is standing up for yourself without expectations from the person with whom you're asserting yourself  Treating people with respect and goodwill is similar  do it because that's who you are  not because of the response you expect   Source  someone who constantly felt unappreciated until I took the advice I'm passing along to you   Wish you all the best  OP That's interesting point  but I feel different   I'm pretty sure I've left impact on some people  since sometimes I meet a guy or a girl which I did not see for a long time and they tell me how they remember me  in a positive way   I'm also quite confident that there were some kids that have looked up to me  sometimes I work with youth   I cheer up a little every time   Damn that's rough  I was expecting something along the lines of drug related or plagiarism  Sounds like an intervention and family counseling would be good for everyone  It may be a long shot but the tv show intervention always does a nice job of making sure everyone is okay in the family and not just the addict  There are inpatient residential treatment centers with detox that she would definitely be able to go to  I dont know the financials of that but love is worth more than money in my opinion  As for the niece  I believe there are residential depression treatment centers as well and if she is struggling as much as it sounds like  then they may be worth a look  As for the first steps  I would just try and make sure everyone is in as good of a living situation as possible  dont rush into anything just do the best you can  I hope it works out for you Game design  I haven't finished a project to demo stage yet  nor have I had any kind of meaningful success validated by any other person  but just the experience of creating something from scratch  learning how to use the tools  the amazing communities around on discord and

doing mindless scrolling through articles i was only half reading into actually building something i'm proud of  And i consider myself to be pretty lazy  generally  Miss Robinson    yay     i hope it goes well  really happy you're getting treatment  3I had the exact same thing  3 years ago I took up lifting  boxing  calisthenics  etc  Helps me vent my anger and stress so much it's like therapy when my skin tightens and I feel as if my arms are about to explode when I'm lifting    But I seriously thought I was the only person who used to think like you You're getting good advice from the others   It is about trust    The only reason to lie about your age is to get into a relationship with somebody who'd pass you by as unsuitable if they knew your real age   It might be from desperation  or admiration  or poor self esteem  but it's at best immature and at worst dishonest   I guess you came on here with your story to get sympathy or justify your actions  In reality  you're selfish and horrible  You've ruined those children's lives and betrayed your sister  Her having an affair or not doesn't justify your actions  You're the worst kind of home wrecker  You're supposed to be able to trust family  Go ahead and respond to defend yourself  Nothing you say will take what you've done back   Not at all  Thank you for your reply No idea why this is being down voted  It's just

especially here in Forever Alone  that is until you step on enough people's toes  I guess Have you tried apologizing  From my understanding not only did you talk politics with a family member who is on the opposite side of the fence from you but you basically said fuck the police and he happened to be a police officer    "when my kid is an adult he can decide if he wants to associate with you again  for now  good riddance"  And honestly this sounds like a pretty level headed response  So I'd say a good apology could  help  Yeah prepare for how London is going to be  I didn't make it into a moral issue either  I think it's offensive of you to assume she is too dumb to have considered it  Of course she did and clearly chose not to  So it's rude to continue to try and push her into it  Moving the US   and then they will turn around and find someone new like there's nothing to it   I'm 36  and I've seen this happen numerous times Thank you for you help  Got a rare smile out of me     "Being a nice person doesn't make you entitled for sex  Being good looking does  though  Even if you are a convicted felon "I don't get it  I thought being nice was good  Do people seriously hate nice people now  I feel like I'm missing something Yeah I've been told that  It rains a lot  Honestly  either tell her that you like her or go no contact cause if she starts dating another dude you're gonna feel like shitI spent    many hours    but a lot of it was trial and error as I was actually trying to teach myself something new as I did this  If I charged by the hour this would be astronomical Can you own up and tell the parents it was your weed This  Put a dollar amount on your time  then just do the math  For example  let's say you think your time is worth  20 hr and you spent five hours on it  So that makes  100  Then maybe because it's a friend you charge him  50 or something  You could always make a new account I didn't say she was too dumb to have considered it  Nope  Didn't say that at all   What I think is that it's valuable to get a perspective which tells her that lots of people don't see this as a moral issue  She said some things that suggest she is viewing it in moral terms   But notice what I didn't do  I didn't tell her to get an abortion  I simply tried to destigmatize it  And she can do whatever she wants Telling someone stuck in depression to man up does more harm than good sometimes  How can you tell from the outside what is laziness and what is derision  You're better off asking what you can do to help them get on their feet  Hey there friend  I'm none too sure if it helps  but i can firmly say that i've been there and dealt with that not being able to trust anyone  And it's not that easy of a feeling to just drop and start trusting people again  There is so much power in love  and even more power in a moment where someone takes back all of it  especially out of the blue   I'll tell you a story  it may help  and i sincerely hope it does  Around this time last year in fact i had a similar issue  in which a girl i had been on and off with for a while suddenly decided yet again that she didn't want to be with me  saddening me a tremendous amount  i sat around doing almost nothing  i didn't eat  i couldn't sleep worth shit  i was a husk of a person because i had given away all of my love and extended my hand when it had been spat on  This was our 4th time breaking up and for some reason it hit me the hardest   Come to find out from my dearest friend who had been talking to her new boyfriend in which she moved onto not even a month after  That she had not only cheated on me  but had sex with multiple other people over our multiple different relationships   This tore a hole in my chest that i didn't manage to mend for over a year  Around that time i met my best friend in the world  every night she would stay up and talk to me and help me cope with my anxieties and feelings  unfortunately for me then she had a boyfriend  and one that also treated her like shit    So we would stay up for an entire year  Telling eachother about our problems  talking to eachother all of the time  until we finally hung out a few times and really became the best of friends    Well come to find out the guy dumps her  and dumps her hard  tells her how worthless she is to him and that be deserves better  So now we have two people with little to no trust with holes in their hearts  having been cheated out of happiness and robbed their love        Well we're dating now  and she's my best friend in the world  I don't even look back for a moment anymore  because she makes me happy and vice versa    It's very possible to move on eventually  but you have to make that first step  Someone like you deserves someone who will give back  There is someone out there for everyone  And not everyone is as cruel as he is Too tired to explain  I think you understand what I  Saying there are just some things about someone that are hard to changeNo prob  Have a good year   That sounds sweet  I'm happy for you Your balls will freeze off  London is crowded as fuck  if you're in a train station stay on the RIGHT side if you're going up on an escalator to let the busy people walk past you  Especially during rush hours  When you're getting on trains and there is a whole crowd  you need to push  Everyone does to get in the train  Just  you know  edge near the crowd to assert your dominance  Jk  But seriously  push a little  You'll encounter a lot of homeless people  One night you might encounter a drunk fucktard near a club  That's it I believe She seemed pretty chill after it happened  cuddling and etc  so I think it's all good  Thanks for your reply  my mind more at ease now that I have an outside opinion    Here's a tip   nobody actually gives a shit if you volunteer  You might if you intern  And better yet  the internship will get you a job  I'd feel differently if I hadn't essentially worked for free including volunteering for the last five years of my life  It's a sort of stereotypical tip for losers    I volunteered in multiple organizations for years  made not a single friend  and worse  I could have used that time that is  required  to get a first job  Even if it's 10 hours a week    Don't volunteer OP  Work  you'll have to anyway  I don't think "expectation" is a fair word for itI struggled for years with social anxiety  I used to hide behind my  now ex  husband in public  I had to push myself to snap out of it  When he would get gas  I would push myself to buy a lottery ticket  I don't gamble  and I don't care about the lottery  but buying a ticket was an interaction with a stranger I had to push myself to achieve  To get through it  I told myself it didn't matter if I screwed up  It's alright if I look like a complete idiot or a nervous wreck  It's a gas station  no one cares  and I'll likely never see that employee again   Ultimately what "cured" me was getting a retail job  It took about 3 4 months before I no longer had anxiety dealing with the average person  It took maybe 6 months before I could consider myself confident and adept at my work  and now I'm being trained towards becoming a lead   Don't hate yourself  Everyone struggles with something  and you can work through it It's not even social signaling

for not having a job   If you volunteer for something you're interested in  you'll meet people with similar interests who you can talk to   Socializing isn't rocket science Sorry for the late reply but have been working all day  I play out in my head what I could say could've said and beat myself down for things that I probably shouldn't have  It sounds weird to everyone if I tried to explain it but at least I know I'm not the only one that does it UK In my opinion  I would tell him only because he was the partner when you got pregnant  However  I also believe that you guys do need to have a clear and open talk that includes you telling him that abortion is not an option for you  but that you still care for his interests and happiness in pursuing going into the coast guard  If he decides to stay  that's on him  If he goes  that's on him  But again  that's just my opinion and that's what I did when I got pregnant  22F  and it worked out just fine  I'm sorry it is really nerve wracking to decide to tell him or not  You're going to do great  OP Well darlin  unfortunately logic doesn't trump here on Reddit or anywhere for that matter  Only popular opinions do  People like to use the

Nothing I'm saying is dependent on whether someone is or isn't religious    What I think is that some people are inundated with moral arguments against abortion and they should get a healthy dose of both sides of the argument to think about  After all  she's the one who will have to live with the decision  so if she considers both possibilities then she can't really regret her decision The amount of up votes i have received on other advice questions says otherwise  Why  Because people who legitimately need advice do a tldr  She may be avoiding the doctors because she is scared of hearing bad news  You should take the initiative and make her an appointment and then take her there  Worst case scenario is they find something that cannot be cured   which leaves her where she is now but with possible medications and treatment options to make her more comfortable  The other outcome is they find something that can be treated and she then receives that treatment  In any case ignoring it isn't going to solve the problem  Serious question   If you need medication to make you want to live  and don't really have an SO  what keeps you going  What makes you wanna take those meds and keep living Try breaking it into TINY steps and then tackling one step at a time  If you still don't feel like doing the first step  that means it's too hard  Make that step even smaller until it doesn't

finds it cute  but I legitimately had no idea I snored Yeah  I was just talking to two people who are gonna be in the bridal party at an upcoming wedding  and they could not BELIEVE the money they were throwing down for every little thing  dress  bachelorette party  bridal shower  hotel  gift  etc etc  if you're about to be a maid of honor  you're probably spending a lot on that experience  no need to add the financial burden of another wedding gift outfit and whatever else on this wedding  no worries Honestly thinking of leaving it behind because of that  Outcome will likely be the same

I'm not into girls and that's not an issue here  Do you think some random normies can help  though  Even trained professionals can't help our condition A good friend of mine was born under similar circumstances    His birth parents agreed that they were in no position to raise a child  so they opted to put him up for adoption  It was "closed adoption"  so he never knew about his birth parents growing up    He did  however  have the blessing of growing up in a close  loving  and financially stable family  I do believe adoption is the most compassionate option for you  If you'd like to know more  message me     Ehhh I would like to have a gf that is my age Not in my world  Non Japanese people don't get any special currency here  though there are more interracial couples than  say  twenty

is 2 years younger  also married and has a child  And I'm sitting here  waiting to get my first crush Find something to ask her about on her Instagram  Then send her a note or whatever  "Hey  I saw that picture of X on your Instagram  That's right near where I grew up  Did you grow up around there " Then once you have a conversation going for a bit  THEN ask for her number   Don't just go "Hey  can I have your number "Thanks for the response  My friend has been bugging me to "get informed" about this  so reading up would be a good idea  I've always liked reading  so this is good  Thanks No no no no no  Let it go   IF she breaks up with said long term boyfriend  and IF she stays apart from him for at least several months  THEN consider asking her out geez  i WISH i had good advice for you but all I've got is  wow  mate  that really sucks  i am just so sorry for your situation   hugs I've heard alot of these new year's posts on the Depression subreddit plenty of answer'sThere's also the student debt  I honestly don't think it's worth accruing unless the degree guarantees a decent frigging job  Hah  I'd say if both parents are willing to have sex with others the kids lives aren't gonna be ruined by this one occasion  Everyone is in the wrong  if you look at it from a traditional pov  If y'all wanna do polyamory  that's a different story  It's generally too late to bring that up as a possibility once both parties have already done the deed with outside parties  though   You need to tell your sister to come clean  and suggest that to him as well  If you keep any of it a secrete  everything's gonna go to hell faster than you can blink  Maybe they love each other but want to have relationships with other people  Maybe they're both unhappy in the marriage and need to split  Regardless of what comes out in the wash  you need to be prepared that your sister is going to be hurt and confused  But believe me  getting everything out in the open is much better than letting it fester and blow up later I don't know this "white male privilege" you speak of  You must have bought into a stereotype  Within the closed  very narrow world within the expat community  it might  seem  like white people have value  but the opposite is true  Dating outside your culture is hard  and these relationships rarely last from the statistics I've read  Thanks for your advice  The

"massage" the brain so that it responds more quickly to psychotherapy Thanks for being open enough to share  It shows maturity that you're processing how you feel  and recognize it for what it is  You're not aloneare they a couple  or why do they want you to move out  if they aren't a couple  that sounds kinda mean Glad I could help   So  one piece of advice you will see here all the time is NEVER to get involved with anyone at work  It's just bound to cause drama   You need to tell this guy clearly that you are not interested and he needs to stop this  ESPECIALLY at work  because you could both get fired I'd rather be depressed with friends Only for another year  though   There is a reason why  in my 34 years of existence  no matter what I try  nobody has wanted anything to do with me      and is that reason something that's out of your control  I mean  some things certainly are  but those would likely not condemn you to complete friendlessness  aside from some rare exceptions      Well  I tried hard  Many people on here try tried hard   I have no doubts about that  but that's not really what I was getting at  It's that  if  you're dead certain that you will never succeed   then  you won't try  Giving up before 25 years of age seems a bit excessive to me  as that's roughly the point where I even had the financial means to be somewhat independent  and thus start figuring out what  I  wanted out of life and how to get there  Before then  it didn't even seem like I really had a chance   And afterwards  it still took literally years to get somewhere  but hey  that's what life is like  Change happens slowly  even if you're going full steam    you'll still be lonely   Lonely and looked down upon   Agreed   Go for it   She's an adult now   As an adult  she doesn't have to do what you say and you don't have to provide her a home   She sounds smart enough that she'll have no problem making it on her own I don't apologize to people who say "n r"  Without any irony  especially  I totally understand what you're going through  I experienced the same thing when I was in university   I ended up tanking all of my classes too  It can be really tough but you have to focus on getting healthy    I've learned that even though it may feel like you're burdening your family or friends  they are really they too support you  Going through this on your own  and without medication  can be really scary and can spiral out of control  You're in a good enough headspace now to realize that you're not coping and asking for help can be really good  It's also ok to talk to your professors about it   they have training and will point you in the direction of some good resources for help    In terms of getting medication  I would check with your school because many offer partial coverage  Additionally  if you can talk with a counsellor  they will be able to provide you with some options  DO NOT take anything that is not prescribed to you  Treating depression and other mental illnesses is not an exact science and you need to work with a doctor to find the right medication that will address your needs  Some medications have adverse effects  your moods could swing too far the other way or even make you feel more depressed  For me  it took about 4 or 5 different tries to get it right and my Doctor monitors my levels regularly and adjusts my dosage as needed    Your health is your number one priority  Don't worry about school or what others might think or financials  this is all a part of depression  Once you start getting help  you'll feel better and start thinking more clearly  trust me   that sad fog goes away    Take care of yourself and if you need to chat feel free to message me   If I were in your position I would have a hard time not telling him  It's as much his baby as yours  That being said  the life of the baby is your choice  I've read a bit and you want to keep it which is 100  your choice  Don't let him change that   And be prepared if he doesn't want a part  But also  if he changes his plan that's his choice  He may feel it's 100  worth it  Please see my reply on the thread "How can I cope with depression  loneliness  and an uncaring family " on this sub reddit  Because I am pretty sure that 90  of it  at least  is applicable here  Make a plan in case of a home invasion  and then let it go   Make your plan as detailed as you need to feel safe   You can even make variants   Hopefully the plan is just to call 911  you don't need to risk your safety to save your stuff   Anyway  the second part of this is to remind yourself that you have a plan when you start worrying   If you feel your mind wandering to "what if there's a home invasion"  just remember the plan and move on I feel the same way  idk

about 95  of the time    If one can use something like the  10 StEPs of Emotion Processing  https   www google com webhp sourceid chrome instant ion 1 espv 2 ie UTF 8 q 10 StEPs of Emotion Processing  or some other "instant clarifier" to be able to  see themselves as they are and  why   http   pairadocks blogspot com 2016 04 critical thinking and logical fallacies html   such conditioning as described above    they are usually able to move up from the first or second of the  five stages of therapeutic recovery  http   pairadocks blogspot com 2015 12 the five stages of recovery html  into the third and even the fourth  And once they get there  it's just a matter of doing the do pretty much as I have described in my replies on several other threads on this sub reddit     Very rarely does talking about it make it worse  There's no rule that says "you can't talk to a therapist about it unless it's REALLY bad " In therapy  bad   adversely affecting your life  This is adversely affecting your life  so you should absolutely talk to your therapist about it she's not MARRIED  so this is not terribly wrong  you should tell her how you feel  and if she feels the same  she will break up with the long distance person and you will date her  it is not wrong to tell a person that you are interested in them just because they are dating someone already  if they're dating your sibling or friend  that might be dicey  but this  you're totally in the clear  Apologies  Many people use moral and religious interchangeably  I am not against abortion for moral reasons  but I can

financialindependence    You may be able to retire in ten years and spend the rest of your life doing anything you want while everyone else from your hometown struggles until the bitter end  Seems like you're cheap enough to do it It's an expression   In the same way that Social Justice Warriors are not literal warriors  a "nice guy" isn't the same as an actual nice guy   A "nice guy" is the kind of person who expects girls to go out with him simply because he's polite  and then gets angry when he has no dates and blames girls for only going after jerks Just find some common ground as the person above said  Also  don't overdo it  I've had guys send me random songs every other week  It gets repetitive and irritating  It just adds on to the list if I previously found them uninteresting  I've had a guy  whom I had no interest in  send me random songs as an excuse to talk  It took him 6 months to actually ask me out  Just have a short chat and ask her to hang out in like a couple of days  It's way more effective to act quickly  Both of you will know where you're at You can buy a decent computer for like  300  and that's a pretty useful item for someone confined to their homeJust because it can't feel pain doesn't mean you aren't ending a life  Morally it's wrong any way you put it  They felt that I was just being lazy  I really don't want to make this all about me  but I think my own experiences can help here  I have ADHD  always have and always will  and one of the fun things about it is that lots of people think it ain't real and you're just being lazy  So I have some experiences with accusations of laziness and I'll impart some of my wisdom   If someone accuses you of being lazy    which you aren't  you're doing more than even the smartest students at my school    tell them everything that you're doing with your life and ask them "Is this laziness now  I wasn't made aware  is this considered lazy " If that doesn't work and if they don't come to their senses ask them what they're doing more than you  if they're so concerned with your laziness    With parents  that probably won't cut it either  something about how you're still young and have so much potential and yeah  yeah  yeah  I usually stop listening three words in anyway  The point is  I never really considered myself lazy because it took a not unkind amount of effort to get myself to do even the simplest things  Even if I only wrote two pages of an uninteresting book report  that took as much effort as you'd put into half of a coding competition  so it wasn't really laziness  I feel the same principle can be applied to everyone and you can employ it too  that as long as you're doing everything you can without over stressing yourself  no one can ask any more of you  It's sort of become my mantra  to do what you can until you can't to deal with what is until it ain't   Bear in mind I'm saying this as someone who barely scraped through high school and is barely scraping through college  and while I don't want to make this a whole "I have it so much worse than you" post  I do think you could learn from my experiences  at least better than I can  and apply some ideas from it to your own experiences to make it easier Noise  industrial  power electronics  black metal  electronic  hip hop  avant garde and free jazz  goth music  blues  and a few forms of avant garde classical

able to be honest with her and explain what's been going on accurately and she will have some good suggestions for me  I don't know how much longer I can do this shit They chose their fate when they had unprotected sex you dim whitted moronJust goes to show you that the people you consider to be your "close friends" may one day turn around and stab you in the back  No such thing as true friendship  unfortunately Thank you for the tip  Drug habits on both sides is not important  What is important is that you are living in her house and adding unnecessary stress in her life  with who she chooses to live it with  Saying that you were going to fight him shows you still have a lot of growing up to do  You should move out and start some of that growing up  The nice guy checklist   Are you angry that you're putting effort into this girl by being her friend but she doesn't like you back   Do you have plans to subtly sabotage the girl's relationship   Do you agree with the statement "girls only like to date jerks"   But no  you are probably not a "nice guy"   For the record  though  it might be worth trying to move on from her   I know from experience that crushing on a close friend is kinda painful if there's no chance that she reciprocates don't think i was clear my apologies  he doesn't live here  and she doesn't own the house  my aunt does    thank you though  i'll take this into consideration While I don't know enough about your relationship to decide what you describe sounds definitely abusive  What you're describing is dissociation and it's very common for people who experienced sexually abusive behaviors  The good news is you can absolutely work on it by yourself and with your boyfriend to make it better  I'm really sorry you've been through some rough things but there is help our there for this type of problem  I have the same one  If you want any resources or just to talk you can let me know Also  my boyfriend and mom  so my support group basically  are aware of this decision  They are prepared to be extra supportive over the next few months to get me through it I'm not making friends with any of these bitches XD So there's this legal procedure called "abortion" that allows you to terminate a pregnancy with the help of a doctor  So  lo and behold  you get another chance to choose your fate even after you're pregnant   If understanding this makes me dimwitted  then I'm not sure I want to be "witted "  By the way  Mr  "Whitted " you spelled "dimwitted" wrong  My and my ex gf are on the other sides of court  You're a lucky guy    Yes I accidentally flirt with all of my teachers  men and women  and it's fucking terrible I'm sure your parents are only looking out for your safety   their concerns are valid   as based off of your post history  you guys haven't been in a committed relationship that long   and they care about you  Give yourself some time to be sad  getting your hopes up AND losing out on a bunch of money is gonna suck  but try not to be too upset with them  as it seems they have the best intentions  Good luck to the both of you  and best wishes    I'll give my university health center a shot  Thanks so much for your suggestion  No  you're just nice  It's understandable  you don't have to be friends  But I think talking to him after he's sober is the best thing to do  I wouldn't just live with something like that my entire life  Idk  I would have a chat with him on a personal level Few home knitters are able to make any money from it  Well  when I finally signed up for facebook a few months ago  I was  and still am to a smaller degree  surprised overwhelmed by how many people from my HS class are married or in a long term relationship  I'm 23  so I guess it's   normal  Guess I'm the abnormal one again   get this   I am a super logical guy plan everything and have contingency plans for my contingency plans   I told her I would never have a kid without first getting genetic testing for both of us and would demand the zygote or whatever have testing and if it were going to be severely disabled terminate the pregnancy    She is in 100  agreement as it isn't fair to the kidI workout by lifting  doing calisthenics and box to illeviate stress  Works like a charm and makes you a healthier person at the same time  Not everyone likes to drive and I don't think you should be even considering it at this point with where you're at with life  Shitty title  I'm not falling for the bait  They've simple switched from opt in to opt out  Opt out should always be the default for organ donation  I love how this is everyone's "go to" example to counter the stupid "looks don't matter" argument    nbsp   It's so trite  but it's true  This example literally proves that you can do horrible things and still be rewarded lavishly if you have the looks That's the plan She probably feels safe around you or likes getting attention from an older guy or simply admires you  Also it's probably exciting for her to get close with someone that's not a family member or  heck  someone that's not her age  It's like when kids feel closer to their aunts than their moms  They're not their mom  but they trust them as an adult   It's probably nothing serious  but If it's a weird vibe you're getting  you should mention it to your gf  She can start observing and give you her stand point on it I know where you are coming from  I had an 8 year relationship with joint checking and co signed auto loan  I worked full time while he worked part time and sold pot    He left for someone else  but that fell through  I don't have him telling me what I can and cannot spend my money on  I don't have my family asking why he's not at a family function with me  I don't have him telling me that my dreams and inspirations are unobtainable     I do miss sharing a life with someone  but I don't miss having someone breathe down my neck     My current policy is to enjoy myself  33 years and I have never lived alone  I'm hoping that changes in this year     Enjoy being single  Don't let anyone tell you that you need another human being to complete your happiness  Best of luck My god you're a moron  If you didn't want the baby you shouldn't be having sex let alone unprotected sex  That aside abortion should be reserved for cases in which the women had no choice  for example rape  Pointing out spelling errors is what children do when they are on the defensive  As much as I was happy for my family member  it was just another reminder of something that I'll never be experiencing in my life I'm so jaded I passed up possible New Year's Eve date  Girl traveling alone asked me if I had any plans and I tersely replied probably have a drink without asking her if      She like to toast the new year with me  due to fear of rejection If you are going to do this be sure to taper slowly off any psychiatric meds   You really don't want to just suddenly stop   Do a little research on what the discontinuation symptoms are like for what you are taking so you have some idea what to expect Eh  You'll have trouble convincing me Mainly video game soundtracks and vaporwave    nbsp   Also  DJ Okawari and Nujabes are great I've seen a lot of normies try to "help" by offering very generic advice   The advice is often accompanied by one or more of the following    humblebragging   condescension   chastising us for not making the right choices in life to attract the opposite sex    If you didn't want the baby you shouldn't be having sex let alone unprotected sex    Lol  Says who  And what year is it   You live by your own morals  I'll live by my own morals that are protected by US federal law  Thanks   I only point out spelling errors when someone makes a spelling mistake while telling me I'm a moron  At that point  it's just too ironic and funny not to point it out You should sit down and figure out a plan for both staying and leaving university   I don't know what your situation is  but I can throw you some questions to answer   First off  how hard would it be for you to take a semester off and then return to finish university   Also  how likely are you to do well if you stay for your last semester   Basically  does either choice have the potential to mess up your future   As for leaving university  I think you should make a plan   What would you do for a semester instead   That's the key  you won't sound like a failure if you explain what you want to use the extra time for Ok  so in terms of language  the UK uses some weird words  if you don't understand what someone means just tell them you recently moved here and I'm sure they'll be more than happy to explain     Go out  socialise  make friends  Pubs  work  coffee shops etc  are the best  places     Money  If you're doing shopping  look around different places and purchasing the store branded products will more than likely save you money whilst giving you the same stuff as other brands  The best stores for food  clothes and other general stuff are Asda  Tesco and Asda  Some cheaper alternatives are Lidl  Morrisons and Aldi     As for driving  do research on driving theory  it's a lot different to the US from what I've seen     If theres anything else you want to know  feel free to inbox me      This post is a few hours old  so hopefully you were able to talk things out with her and avoid any hostility  Confronting someone about this stuff can be very difficult  but hopefully she cares enough about you to realize that even if she's ashamed about what she did and would prefer to forget about it  that you need the whole story    Best of luck to both of you in this trying situation  lmfao that's meTalking to people at work  mostly  Asking about weekends  joining for coffee breaks  inviting them for coffee  asking if anyone was grabbing a drink on Friday after work  etc  And any open social activity at work I made sure to be join  no matter how nervous or shy I feltWay to go  Even if this particular instance doesn't work out  just keep in mind that you successfully got a date and there's nothing stopping you from improving or doing it again Didn't bother to read what you posted since it's most likely more ignorant shit Start charging her  5 every time it's left on the carpet  Make a turd jar  Save up enough money in the turd jar to get your own place  Problem solved The first thing I was going to say was to talk to your classmates and study together for shit  That's how I made some friends    nbsp   But you've tried that already  I'm sorry I can't help you  and I do wish that things will turn out in your favor in the future Thats why i laugh at that stupid normie advice  "Just wear nice clothes and have style  be confident and lift bro " No  fuck you  Here i am wearing my long sleeve polo shirt  t shirt's  meme shirts  colonge  dress shirts  chino pants  khakis  and dress shoes or nice boots or nice sneakers  giving me confidence to approach girls and get nothing  Then theres fucking Chad and average guys who wear hoodies  gym shorts and slide on slippers or plain t shirts and jeans pulling girls left and right  Here i am with my muscular body giving me confidence with none of the girls i was promised to attract while i see normal bodied or skinny guys having no problems getting girls    FUCK this self improvement crap  Im outclassed by anyone whos physcially attractive  Lmao  The funny thing is i never even had a chance  Looks like i'll be paying prostitutes and marrying my action figures For older FA's who've had a few missed chances at love  Scrooge fits the bill  which is why I mentioned him in FA role models post Sabotage Christ    I downvoted you not because you are wrong  which you were  because of your incessant abuse of the term darlin    There  I said it  What advice do you need  I probably could help you  Nothing now  The problem's been solved  But still  I don't have any close friends  so when I need some relationship advice I typically go to reddit  Since I don't always know how to begin a conversation with my SO if one needs brought up You sound like Reddit's dream girl  I honestly don't know how you're single   I don't mean that in a "Ur just 2 picky   gurls can't be FA " way  I mean it must just be shit luck or something  because I'm sure hearing a woman say what you wrote would cause legions of nerd hearts to explode Thanks retard If he is your real friend he'll understand Look at his sides  He does have oneI just remembered  another personal finance blog is called GetRichSlowly     Another useful appliance to have is a slow cooker  aka crock pot   it's easy to make decent tasting meals in them for cheap   In general  pre processed convenience food  whether from restaurants or pre packaged at convenience stores  tends to be more expensive and also causes more health issues compared to food you make your self   There would be no shame or embarrassment  There would be no anxiety as in it will be too late Straight talk    You're a piece of shit    The escort is just the start  Your excuses are pathetic  You're not ready for a real relationship if you want to play the field l  Youre immature and insecure when you start comparing partner numbers  You are not a man because you cannot speak straight  Afraid to end something you have now and wanting side chicks at the same time  You dont have the balls to end this  which with your thinking and attitude  you WILL cheat on her again    Hope it comes back and bites you in the ass  and then you'll find out what heartache is  4 years now    Imagine her cheating on you 5 years in  You want to play the field    What if she does to  No  but you're jealous as well  Wow    Best advice  Leave her  if she's mature  she will find the one who is done playing the field  who is ready to love undivivded without thought of betrayal and with complete loyalty  Vanilla you say  Yet this is the only one you had that loves you  Bullshit  This is the best you've had  Its the McLaren of what you ve ever known   Fish or cut bait  Don't be indecisive  And don't become a fucking piece of shit habitual cheater  Plenty of those in this world man  You have to understand that when one is suicidal  they don't see the world properly   Every time I tried  it was because I truly believed that the world would be a better place without me   I genuinely believed that if I were dead  my mother  boyfriend  friends  and family would be happier   I tried to do it   for   them in a way   And you calling suicide a selfish act is literally the last thing that any person who is or has been suicidal needs to hear   What it sounds like  to us  is that we are even worse people  and it almost reinforces the idea that we would be better off dead   Please consider that in the future   You never know when someone's on the edge Its not suppose to DO anything for us personally  Its just to expose normies to their bullshit and everyone else on here guy commits crime  gets offer to be a model  earns millions    I commit crime  gets raped in shower I'm not an expert on the matter but just throwing in my two cents     I would recommend a priority of yours may be filming evidence of the noise at unreasonable times  just in case you should end up in an eventuality that should require it  Beyond this all I can recommend is investigating your local bylaws and what authority you need to contact for noise complaints in your area    From my own experience I could only say that police are useless with noise complaints   may be much better where you live though    I reckon you'd be better off contacting your city council or taking another course of action if one comes to you  however  if the police have promised to resolve the issue for you then I'd still recommend pursuing this alongside    Hope you manage to solve the issue He's super super skinny and weighs less than me and it makes me feel really self conscious about myself A lot of my cousins are getting married  They are a few years older than me  There is not a single person in my entire family that is a kissless FA like me You guys wanna split the check to go to Korea for some plastic surgery I would ask why you're even here with that attitude  but   I'll leave my curiosity be   I sniffed you out  though  Good on me You could try to work at a ski resort  You get a free season pass usually Im sorry bud  I understand you not wanting to give too many details  Feel free to pm me  I cant guarantee i will know but i do have a bunch of experience with relationships  I hope that in the future you wont need to be that specific for decent advice Uses retard as an insult     Talks about morals Congrats  This gives me hope  I'm happy for you      I'm 28 and in the same position you were are  No date  no kiss  not even a romantic hug  and like you I'm not bad looking at all  I just never asked a girl on a date before    Were you comfortable during the date  I get pretty nervous around people I like  I sometimes shake or even stutter a bit  Does it make you anxious  to think that you'll have to initiate a kiss  for the first time   I'm terrified of the awkwardness of kissing or having sex  because at this age we're expected to know how to do these things well  and it's not like you can practice these things    Happy for you   loneliness and anxiety can be so crippling  it takes a lot of strength to overcome it  I know I can get some matches on tinder  but the thought of going out on a date makes me feels so damn anxious This isn't legal  She doesn't have to pay the roommate for the poop her dog makes  However  has your landlord stated anything about pets  You can make a complaint to the landlord if it bothers you  Should I believe this to be true or not   1   attractive   confident   hot  2   attractive   shy   cute  3   ugly   confident   creepy  4   ugly   shy   a ghost My mom continues to give me shitty platitudes by telling me that "there's always someone out there  it's only a matter of time" or the classic "you're so handsome and sweet  a girl would be crazy to turn you down   " etc  Of course  it's only natural for every mother to think that her child is beautiful  but come on    there's no way you can call a nerdy acne ridden guy handsome    nbsp   As for my dad  we were talking about what I was planning to do after I graduate from college  He casually mentioned that "if your wife gets a job and works  the two of you could make a lot of money by combining your incomes together " Literally felt like laughing in front of him right then and there    nbsp   Out of the few times I invited friends over to my house from early elementary school to even now in the middle of college  all of them were guys  Not even a single girl  If that's not a red flag to my parents that says "hey your pathetic son is going to die as a lonely virgin"  I don't know what would be     nbsp   I have a gut feeling that my parents do know about my situation  it's just that they're too embarrassed and ashamed to bring it up  They can't believe that the family line ends here That's awesome news  Sorry that you had to wait so long  but it's great that you get to get started I am taking his advice I'm trying to find some way to make myself better from it every reason to be entirely negative   nbsp   Ofc the "normies" refuse to believe this  If you haven't been in our shoes  you would never understand I'm an insurance agent in Ohio  Basically what is going to happen is they'll send out an adjustor that will estimate how much it will cost to make you whole  and that might be fixing OR replacing your bumper  A replacement isn't always necessary  and you cannot demand a new bumper simply because you want one  Contrary to popular belief  insurance companies are not out to screw everybody  they're just not going to give you more than what it costs to return your vehicle to pre loss condition  That would be considered betterment  and it's illegal in all 50 states Find someone that shares an interest and talk about that    Or if just for talking whilst having a short interaction then light conversation subjects work to past the time  weather  news  holidays etc      Or if your mind goes blank at the time  plan a subject before the time to fall back on   Edit  You'd get more replies if you posted during peak hours  like 6pm   and could try r CasualConversation  That really sucks  This situation is basically taking your FA status and shoving it in your face  For me  I am FA and have completely lost the capacity to get crushes  I am 24M and cannot get crushes  Its been like that since I was around 18  I am not sure if this a good thing or a bad thing He's not talking about anorexic shredded  He means bald and a muscular body  something similar to this i'd imagine  https   shechive files wordpress com 2012 10 mystery misc 1713 jpg quality 100 strip info w 500Actually I wasn't darlin  that's simply your opinion  Still to downvote as the result of disagreeing and  or your entitlement is against the rules  but I am sure you don't give a good God damn about those  I say darlin out of habit  not out of the context of being condescending  But since you and your opinion of how I speak type are so fuckin important to me  I will work on it  Said no one ever  There  I said it  Better  Alrighty then  I am glad we had that conversation  Mmm'kay pumpkin I do try looking at some of them optimistically but sometimes I feel like giving up because it seems harddo you know what happened to that dog that killed your cat  sounds dangerous   Do I have a choice of which auto body shop to go to Damn  that actually does look like me  without the dirty old piss jugs though    marrying action figures    not marrying superior anime figurine  I shiggy diggyIve started lifting too  I think just make sure what your motives are  If its to get girls forget it not worth it but if its because you want to be healthy and strong  worth  I prefer Jeffrey Dahmer as my go to example  That guy is one of the sickest humans to ever walk the earth I'm making efforts to improve myself So I'm not like those other people  for those people it's like they want to be Depressed I don't want that so I'm trying to get helpAbsolutely  You do not have to use a preferred shop  you can take the check and use it at any shop you'd like I don't know if this is helpful  but I'd look into a trade school of it were you  A lot of them are only 2 years and will place you into a job right after you graduate  or to work part time with pay while you're still in school  Ouch  Black guy  You can learn a few things from him  Ouch I am not doing it specifically to attract girls but to be more self confident about my physical appearance  I also feel like I am not very strong for the average man  I am not looking to go crazy I laughed at this thread and it's comments more than I should have  Now I'm getting strange looks from people  Totally worth it  Thank you so much  you made me feel better about possibly not going to this wedding    I haven't even looked into hotels or gifts or anything  but I'm dreading having to do that  My friend is doing her best to keep cots low for the bridal party  but still  It's going to be a lot  and I don't think I need this added onto my stress  You need stop being friends with her  Clearly you have been interested in her romantically more than a friendship  Go find another girl to be with  Stop wasting your time  Dude Work at a zoo or aquarium  Work at a national park  They acknowledge she was diagnosed  but they think depression itself is bs  and she cant stand up to her parents and just hand them the material1990   18   2008 I think I'm doing something wrong Life as a truckerHappy for you  Good ending to something  My friend and his brother both got nose jobs  I don't know why his brother got one because I thought he looked fine  but my friend felt insecure about the 'bump' in the middle of his nose   Honestly  when I saw him after I didn't notice much of a difference  But  I didn't even notice anything 'off putting' about his nose in the first place "The Virgins" are a fitting group for this sub  they do have some decent songs though tbh  It's so annoying when people point out that we're quiet  I never know  how to respond to that     They assess the damage  I go to a body shop and the body shop will confirm the estimates and damage and tell me how much it would cost then they tell the insurance and insurance pays them Make new plans because you can  You don't seem to understand how volunteering works    Theoretically  yes  you make friends  Every single volunteering requirement specifies a number of hours  I was a member of the Red Cross  you mostly took directions from whoever was leading a meeting or the event at hand    Why would socializing with people someone shares no context with  like class  be less difficult than socializing in college    There is literally no volunteering opportunity that only requires an hour and if someone has free time   shouldn't they be doing something that actually benefits them    "Volunteering is no excuse for not having a job " That's right  But students have limited non school hours  And people recommend volunteering as a cure all  It's stupid  Having done it for five years in the absence of real social or professional guidance  I think it's condescending too    If socializing weren't "rocket science" this sub nor the op's complaint would not exist    He was the Milwaukee Cannibal  right    nbsp   I remember reading in a Wikipedia article that this guy would lure random guys into his apartment  then rape and dismember them  He tried bleaching the corpses to destroy evidence  and I think he actually kept a few skulls too     nbsp   I know that some idiot "normie" may argue that not all good looking people are able to get away with heinous crimes  That's absolutely true  but imagine how much worse their situations would have been if they were ugly For me you could argue that "confidence" does add attractiveness  For me  if a girl is confident and flirts with me I will naturally start to like her more  However  if she was extremely ugly to begin with  none of that would matter  You need to already be attractive in order for confidence to increase your attractiveness Thank you  I really appreciate your response  I'll try to look into a residential treatment center  No you are a Hebephile How old are you and how long have you been lifting It can't hurt  Good luck  If you think of it  let us know what happens  Sounds like you avoided hell  but yeah dont let small stuff get to you She cant stand up to them about it  let alone me  Her parents refuse to go to any form of counselling with her  And honestly  things would get so much better if she could step away from her parents  but unfortunately  they pay for her education and she lives there  Things would only get worse if she were to move out   One of the big sticking points with her and her parents is sh feels like they are always disappointed in her  dropping out would worsen that My father believes meeting someone does not matter and that I should not be unhappy about being FA   My mother is in denial and believes I will meet someone when I least expect it If they're coming out to inspect they'll usually do an on the spot assessment using average labor and parts rates  and have you a check within a few days  9 times out of 10 it's enough to cover damages at any body shop  However  don't walk into the body shop and tell them how much money the insurance company gave you  Shady body shops have known to raise their estimates to match the insurance check so they can keep the whole thing Yeah  you can't be worrying about him and  as you say  "ruining his future"  He made the decision to have sex and whatever choice you make regarding the child he'll just have to deal with and support you  Give your mom an apology  You can say that you don't like the guy  but it sounds like she already knows that  When I was 20 I was living with 4 roommates in a roach infested 2 bedroom apartment  just to get away from my parental drama  A day will come you will think this was all sillyIf all the nerd guys hearts explode  then there's no more guys left to be my boyfriend I guess   Idk  must be looks or size  I'm a little overweight  K and I are in Charleston now too  We stopped at her uncle's on our way to Florida     In other news we're moving to Florida  It makes the most sense right now for us and Michigan was a train wreck  So we will be living in Clearwater for a few years till we can hit the road with our little person Why not  Being a virgin isn't a bad thing  I believe that its a hard thing for parents to accept that their child will never meet anyone Thank you I'm sorry you went through all of that  I'm not qualified to give advise on this but good for you for seeking help and I hope you find the advise you need He made the decision to sleep with you  That was a joint decision with joint responsibility    If you don't tell him  he won't have time to prepare  He has a steady job with good income  he can suck it up    Tell  Him  Today  Hi OP  I'm one of the moderators for this sub  I can imagine it was really hard for you to post this here and I'm proud of you for reaching out for help and sharing what happened to you with strangers   I'm reminding all commenters to stay helpful  respectful  and avoid giving relationship advice  Please focus on OP's problem and not the dating situation  You will be removed and banned otherwise I'm sorry to hear that  If only the US were civilized   Way of the road  Bubs She is not lazy though  she has spent her entire academic career working her ass of to be successful  She is responsible when it comes to her chores  and is anything but lazy  She is depressed not lazy  If telling her to "man up" worked  she'd be fine with the way her parents confront her about her depressionNot just that  Extensions  false eyelashes  push up bras  fake nails     It's like what part of the girl is real Hi  OP   Please contact a support group immediately  Your current situation is not what describes you  and you should not let it determine who you are or what you do  Ending your life is not a good decision at all  I tried that once  many years ago  and I'm glad that I did not go through with it  Also  committing suicide does not end the pain and suffering  it will only pass it on to someone else   Remember  you are loved It's strange isn't it  I actually find it really weird   A girl did this to me the other day and I never knew what to do  I wasn't even talking to her  just sitting next to her  and after every remark she would glance at me  I'm normally pretty expressionless  so I felt like I had to fake expressions  haha    I think it's a sign of friendliness  I find that empathic people tend to do this  They want you to feel like you're part of the conversation  If you're sitting there quietly they might think that you feel left out of the conversation  so glancing at you every now and then makes you feel more involved  It's a kind gesture  really     Just smile a bit  or chuckle if they're reacting to something funny   and if you can try to get involved more I've been in the same shoes as your girlfriend  Even at times where I was having suicidal thoughts  my parents still acted as if there was nothing wrong and that I was making excuses just to be lazy  At a point  things escalated to the point where my therapist had me put her down as a speed dial and called me every day just to make sure that I wouldn't try to harm myself when I went home for a vacation  My aunt attempted suicide twice  Both times my parents made it out to be desperate attempts for attention and to this day  deny that her depression is anything but laziness and faked attempts for attention   In Asian American society  mental illness still holds a lot of stigma and it's going to be hard to bypass that  The only way that your girlfriend can try to get her parents to listen is if she somehow breaks down that stigma  to show them that depression and anxiety are real yet are not a sign of weakness  that proper support and treatment will allow her to thrive  She needs to sit with her parents  get them to listen to her and hear her struggles as they are  and maybe set up a conference with her therapist psychiatrist so that they see that a fellow medical professional accepts the diagnosis or can at least provide evidence of mental illness  Some therapists are even willing to call parents directly Trust me ur not alone  I'm starting to think it's just kind of a normal feeling for everybody who are in a relationship  Just remember that whoever ur dating chose to ask u out or accept dating u FOR A REASON I don't think you know what a catfish is you're trying to justify your urges to cheat  Some people require their relationships to be monogamous  and some do not  You need to find someone who has the same views you do  There's lots of happy poly people out thereI recommend using the My Fitness Pal app to keep track of your daily caloric intake as well as your nutrient intake  It gives you a goal based on your lifestyle and I find if you set up the notifications  it helps to shape the way you eat Wait so when you said they'll give me a check  they'll actually give me a check   The auto body shop of my choice and insurance won't work together   If it cost less to fix  I can keep the change   If it cost more for some reason  I'll tell the insurance and they both work it out   Also would it be okay to not get my car fixed and just keep the check   Like I said  I got an incident report from the rental company of their employee hitting me and admitting it's his fault so there is no scam going on Dude If you aren't confident with your current body then it could help at least a little bit  Being comfortable with who you are is an important step If you have to ask   Much appreciated     Have you ever been a shy person I would honestly just discuss with your roommate that the dog is creating an unsanitary environment  Just tell her you don't want to lose the bond you have as friends roommates because you don't think that anyone else would be as fun and comfortable to live with  but that you just want her to help you keep the home sanitary so you can both be comfortable in your home  I'm a little confused as to who hooked up with whom  but it seems like everybody is hooking up with each other  If your friend is supposedly hooking up with other girls while supposedly dating the girl you hooked up with  then I wouldn't worry too much about his reaction to you hooking up with her  And it doesn't sound like she's too committed either  It sounds like you need to meet some new people and maybe just altogether avoid sleeping with the same people your friends are sleeping with  Also should I mention I got a check from an insurance company or no   If so just don't mention the amount Understandable   That's a pretty tough spot   I agree with seeking help from a school counselor or another adult who may be able to help interveneNice tastes  I recognize most of the artists on your metal list  Have you listened to Lifelover and Apati  They are similar to Psychonaut 4    And  dalek is one of my favourite industrial hip hop artists So I was dating in the womb I will download that now and see how it works  I worry those apps are very picky and confusing  Yes  they'll write the check out to you  you can cash it and do whatever you want with the money  Unless their is a lien on your car then they may make it out to you and your lien holder who will have to sign off on the check for you to get the funds to repair it  If you own the car outright you can cash it and keep it if you want  I had a lady hit my 20 year old Subaru a few months ago  I got a 600  check to fix my bumper and I just kept it because who the hell gets a bumper fixed on a 20 year old Subaru  32 year old that's never even been on a date  matched with a girl on Tinder  went on date  went pretty good  am hopeful for the future regardless of outcome   BeautifulI think I always will be a little  I've slowly gotten confident over the years but yes I am a little shy I believe I have the same thing with my nose  it comes from being a child mouth breather in most cases  his nose wasn't the problem with his face  it was probably other things but he didn't know what exactly Lol  You seem to be forgetting that I'm making the argument that has nothing to do with morals  So I'm being consistent I didn't go to college right after highschool like many people and now its a few years later and I'm considering going just for the chance of making friends   but I don't think I would  Just tell them you want an estimate to repair your bumper  Either they'll say "Yes  we can buff it and paint it" or "We need to replace your bumper and match the paint" Unless it's cracked or dented  it won't need replaced  Paint swaps can be buffed out and repainted and you'd never know it was there I hear ya  Hopefully he didn't even think about it like that  I just hope I can still trust his judgement going forward  Thank you This is me as well  I've written posts about it on here  but I went to a University with LOTS of attractive people  women especially  I was fine at first  but it really wore me the fuck down being ignored and invisible all the time as well as being treated with annoyance and disgust when girls were forced to interact with me  Having no platonic friends made it worse too  I was just very alone    Christ  just thinking back to it gives me chills  So many beautiful girls  it was absolutely shocking and equally devestating knowing they found me disgusting and wanted nothing to do with me    I dropped out after 1 year  Not sure what to tell you then  your question was  "How do you convince someone anxiety and depression are real " I provided 2 very viable ways to do that  If neither one of you can "stand up" to them  which I guess is what you would consider sharing information to be   and they refuse to listen to a professional  what other miracle answer were you expecting  And I even suggested limiting time with them  but neither of you can do that either   it sounds like their acceptance of her mental health problems isn't as important to either of you then as her education and having a place to live  presumably rent free   If it was  she'd find a way to pay her own way for the sake of her mental health  So if nothing changes  she "can't" or won't make a change   then nothing changes  Again  not sure what magic solution you were looking for I am confident with my personality and all that I have achieved  I still have very low confidence in myself physically She's probably between 3 and 4 on the recovery  but she doesn't really fit anywhere  She is 19  but moving out isn't an option as long as she is in school  and dropping out of school isn't an option  She wants to distance herself from her family  excluding her sister and one of her cousins  as soon as she can  but while she's dependent  she can't   Also  thanks for the marriage advice  lol  She actually doesn't want to have a marriage affiliated with any culture  just a marriage licence in a court house  Maybe one or two friends  but she doesn't want to deal with family and culture  Ok  thanks for your response it is much appreciated Thanks for your comment  I like your idea for thinking outside the box  I hadn't considered that way of looking at things  but I will now Yeah  I got a loan from my own insurance company State Farm so I guess I got a lien on my car   It's a 2016 model   Once I get the check  I need to go to my insurance's office and have them sign the check   Once they sign it I can do whatever with the check   Or since I got a lien on my car  I would need to get it repaired    And when their insurance call me can we setup any place to meet or should it be at my house You write very well    Anyway  the only real way to move on is to get your mind into something else  Dead end job  Look for another  Blah friends  Get different friends  Change  something  in your life  Take a trip  even alone   Unrequited love sucks I feel the same way every time i wake up and all day and night too Yup  thats him  You can actually see the photos of his victims  but i warn you its brutal and their burned into my mind  This is the man that women were sending gifts  love letters  and marriage proposals too  With a crime like what dahmer did no matter how goodlooking you are you arent getting away with it  but you'll ALWAYS have plenty of women who will still fuck you Sounds like a panic disorder  You don't have to necessarily ascribe "panic" to your condition to be having a panic disorder  Especially if you're feeling impending doom    There is zero chance you could have AIDS and have it not show up on an exam  AIDS progresses from HIV  which you'd have to contract first  That also would be evidenced on an exam    Have you sought help from a psychiatrist  That's what I figured  just wanted a second opinion is all  Somebody once told me the world was gonna roll me  I aint the sharpest tool in the shedI was hoping for something bullet proof that has worked before  just throwing articles in their faces wont work  And they accept her because she is their daughter  but they don't accept the way she is because they don't believe in depression That is really great If there is a lien on the car it will need to be repaired  Your lien holder will not want unrepaired claim damage on a vehicle  If you're in another accident in the future and have unrepaired claim damage from a prior claim it can be a real nightmare  You don't want to be driving around a scratched up 2016 car  I'd definitely get it fixed  If it's made to you and state farm just call your agent and ask them where you need to mail or bring the check to so it can be properly endorsed Hon  you probably have health anxiety hypochondria  I saw this as a hypochondriac  so I'm not judging you  You need to see your doctor for s check up and some anti anxiety mess and a therapist to get to the root of your health anxiety   3I'm a university lecturer  so I'm writing this as if you were one of my students  It seems to me that you have the opportunity to get exactly one of the lessons you should out of college  College is not just about learning the subject matter  You will actually learn more as an engineer on the job than you will in the classroom  so your internship will be invaluable   I'm in the hard sciences  not engineering  but the same applies   The thing that you can and will learn is time management and how to prioritize both your commitments and your social life  You've already diagnosed the problem  you procrastinate and then cram  As a lifelong procrastinator myself  I promise you  you can get better about this  It will be a struggle  but that is sort of the point of college  struggle now  in an environment that is serious  but that allows you the flexibility to make mistakes like you did last semester and still bounce back  I suggest you start googling time management strategies  and try some out that you think might work for you  Do you need to schedule study time everyday  I think you should do this  e g  If you have class from 9 12 on Monday  schedule an hour for lunch and 2 4 for studying  as if it is a class  Do this everyday  for a minimum of 30 minutes  Force yourself to go to the library or wherever you can focus  and make it a routine like going to class or work    Give yourself early deadlines on assignments  Also  i notice that a lot of students try to go it alone  and do not take advantage of the resources available to help them succeed  Are you going to your professors' and TAs' office hours  We want you to come  It makes me sad when no one comes  and the students who are there regularly are invariably the ones who do best in the class   I would discourage you from taking time off unless your mental health is seriously suffering because that seems like running away from the problem instead of trying to fix it  You owe it to yourself to try  I know it seems like the end of the world  but it's only been one bad semester  and in five years  you won't even remember feeling this way       Finally  all that said  I do think it is worth asking yourself if engineering is right for you  but wait until after next semester  Give yourself a shot at it  but if you got into it for the wrong reasons in the first place  and you think there is something more suited to you  go for it and don't look back Your point on rejection is interesting  I believe that really the only ways a FA could escape FA is   1   being friends with a girl somehow  relationship develops from there  2   online dating  doesn't apply for ugly FAs   The normie pickup type shit and meeting women at bars and all that is just unrealistic for us FAs and I don't really see any FAs that have success doing it  I definitely don't want to come off as downplaying your concerns or anything like that  but I would trust the doctors when they tell you everything is fine and normal  The chance of having something that they haven't caught is so so small  It sounds like you are dealing with a lot of anxiety though  because your description of the feeling of impending doom fits that to a T  I agree with the other comment  your brain might be latching on to the idea that you have AIDS as a way to deal with that feeling of doom and giving it a tangible reason  Anxiety shows itself in different ways for different people so you might not recognize it as such  but if it is impacting your life this severely I urge you to talk to someone about it  Your feelings are not embarrassing at all and I guarantee your doctor won't think so either  Best of luck   3Bro  you are still young so you still have a chance at getting out of being FA  but you need to work on your showering skills  Looks don't matter  but showers do It's people just being passive aggressive  It's immature so just ignore them She's refused to see a doctor of her own for 4 years because it wasnt doing her any good  but her parents would refuse to talk with professionals about depression  Tbh  it feels like trying to argue with anti vaxxers   also  she will see another one soon  she just has some personal barriers to overcome first Unfortunately  life doesn't work that way  You can't level up if you don't play  So you have to grind every month  every week  sometimes every day  to get results  And you can make excuses  but those aren't going to get you to where you want to be It's hard to ignore it God I fucking hate this lifeDo you have any included health insurance through your university  I'm in Canada and we have insurance included in our tuition fees  not that we have a load of health costs up here but I can use it for dental and glasses and such  Keep trying and failing  Progress is inevitable    Force yourself to say a thing or two to people like store clerks  teachers  coworkers  anyone really   trying and failing is the only way we'll improve I was at a party with a lot of couples  Watching everyone else make out at midnight sucked Yeah  I think this is a memorable  enlightening moment for all potential FAs  When you reach the age where your peers of a similar age are getting married and having children while you have never kissed a girl or gone on a date  It really starts to show you just how abnormal you are  Your friends seem a little arsy man  I know what it's like to have a constant battle inside of you because I once had it and one of my friends decided to say it out loud and everyone heard  I wasn't angry  just speechless really  I didn't know what to do or say and so I just did nothing  Don't sweat it man  if you're actually upset then go talk to your ex about or if you don't even care she said it sometimes it's good to vent to someone who wasn't part of it like what you're doing now   I think I'd be pretty mad at the fact that two of my friends are talking behind my back about it  Personally  I would be angry  If the mockery gets worse it isn't worth hanging out with them  I mean it's all good if you don't mind but not if they're doing it to purely and intentionally hurt you for some sort of fucked comedic gain they're not worth having as friends I agree  but no way any older women would go for me  They don't care as much about looks  but I'm just too much of a loser for an older woman  Consistently ignorantDo you feel walked on  ignored  or both Call helpI think you play it safe by 'feeling' guilty  It is convenient to think this way  You 'feel' guilty because you think that is the way YOU ought to feel  But emotions are always felt  A variety of them and they are going to happened intuitively  It is your response that you can rationalize and in that way control  Oh no    Is she with a therapist right now  I assume that she is and has been since she has access to anti depressants  Is she still living at home with her parents  Shit  I thought this was r needsynpathy not r offmychest   Who ever knew that maybe some people have to relieve their conscious because they can't confide with anyone else  Does it matter when I go to the body shop for the estimate   If not I'll go asap which will probably be before the adjustor contacts me   So once I get the check  get it signed by my own insurance since they're my lien holder  pay the body shop for the repair and if it cost less than the check then I can keep the rest of the money   Also do people usually set up meet ups with the adjustor at home or can it be somewhere else Sudafed  at least the sudafed I remember  is also a bit of a stimulant   enough so that I got briefly addicted to it as a kid    Definitely bring it up with your psychiatrist  its a good clue at least I'm not single at all  but I don't care a bit  If it didn't happen for someone yet  it just didn't happen for them yet    I think there are some benefits to dating a virgin that surpass the drawbacks  That being said  I would prefer to date someone with some experience  but being a virgin is not a deal breaker at all  It's an adventure you have to want to take I wish you well  truly  Keep in mind that if you try a university system  the "students" treating have almost completed training and their treatment plans must be overseen by licensed  usually top in their field  physicians   Also  you can always withdraw from treatment at any point if you voluntarily sign in  at least that is so in the US    She likes you as a friend She was prescribed the drugs by her PCP  and yes  still living at home  she has to while she is in school since her parent are paying for it  She hasn't seen a therapist for 4 years  but she will after she overcomes internal barriers You can usually choose to meet them at your home  office  or at one of their approved body shops  I took my Subaru to their approved shop  they faxed in the estimate  and I had a check 4 days later  Preferred shops partnered with large insurance companies are usually pretty good  the insurance company won't associate with a body shop that does shoddy work Do it  Nothing wrong  A lot of ppl use them No point in being angry  it will solve nothing  Having a grudge against someone is unhealthy and although you used to get bullied those people probably had something else going on in their life making them vent it out on others  Are you still shy I think this is how it works here too  I've been thinking about it for the last couple of months   actually my ex wife showed it to me a few months back and I am slowly absorbing the idea  I am trying to find a contact phone email to see how exactly this works  I was going to make a shower joke but it's too depressing  The lengths people go to defend him are insane  The halo effect is real and this is an example of it  People call us nice guys for saying how criminals and other bad people can find significant others but we can't which means logically  to most women  we are actually worse people than certain criminals  I'm not saying all women think that way or even a majority because most women don't want to date an actual criminal  especially one who is violent  The problem is  there are enough women who would to make sure guys like him will never have a problem finding women  Society thinks that we are worse than these guys  Being a nice guy despite most of us not fitting their definition is worse than being a pretty bad person It's really just human nature  for both you and your sister  I don't feel that either of you is a bad person Get some cameras  They've been trespassing clearly  Catching them in the act will help a lot  This one is fairly straight forward I find but it's the way I found to watch what I eat     Then don't try to meet girls at Uni  There are girls other places too  Like what about activity clubs  I didn't promise this would be easy Psychoeducation for both clients and caretakers families is absolutely evidence based and a first line defense intervention for both anxiety and depression    You last 2 sentences make no sense and are contradictory You need to remember the FACT that many people go to community college when they are not initially accepted to a university  They then transfer  which is common I am living proof of that  and they go on with their lives  They continue with their goals AND they SAVED money while SUCCEDING there    As for the essay  it is still not Wednesday  Go make things happen yea  tbh I'm not jealous of people who get married at a young age  so many will have huge stressful problems in the future Sorry  once it's out there  you can't do anything to take it offline I'm waiting for the "you guys just need to lower your standards because you think that all of you feel entitled to a woman who looks like that  and you all reject below average looking women " I've never had the chance to reject a woman no matter what she looked like because she rejected me before I could even think about it The Internet is forever  One more thing  for now   Once I paid off my car loan  would I need to do anything about the lien like sign some papers to hand over the car to me 100  Someone tell me what he has to offer besides his looks that aren't directly related to the halo effect Did you check behind the dresser  Under the dresser  Under other furniture in the room  Is it a smart phone  can you use find my phone  Thank you    Yeah  f ck you too buddy      ur whalecum      You say you like her but you call her a bitch  Is this a kid thing When a partner cheats  it's ultimately the lies and deceit that hurts the most  The intent to hide information and the secret relationship is what destroys a relationship when the cheating comes to light   If he was honest and upfront about it  as I have asked him to  on multiple occasions  I might have explored some form of non monogamy with him   But he chose to continue lying and telling someone else that he loves her  He loves her  It's not just about the fucking anymore  dude I hope you two break up  I want to punch my past selfYes  they'll need to remove the lien from your title and mail it to you after the loan is paid in full I'm a long time lifter  a few points    So  lifting can make a difference  It can make you more confident as well as more attractive  but it's very important that you don't put all your eggs into the lifting basket  For some "FAs"  younger guys that tend to have friends  fairly normal looking  just haven't had good luck with women  it can make a big difference  But for losers like myself and actual FAs  I'd say over 21  kissless virgin  no friends or social skills   with pretty much no social skills and an ugly face  it doesn't do much in regards to women  I've built myself a pretty decent physique  180lbs  15 percent bf  and it really hasn't made any difference  women are still disgusted and disinterested in me  It has raised my confidence though compared to before I started  Like I said though  for some normalish guys  it can make them a bit more attractive while giving them confidence to interact with women    Also  don't worry  you won't look like a bodybuilder  There's a pretty common misconception among people new to lifting that they will pick up a weight and blow up like a show ready bodybuilder  It takes good genetics  years of perfect training and nutrition  and anabolic steriods to achieve the physique that bodybuilders do    Feel free to PM me if you have any fitness related questions  Thanks so much for your reply  I will take a look at all of these suggestions  I appreciate it  thank you again  All you can really do is chalk it up to life experience  You wanted to know what it was like and you tried it and didn't like it  The real issue you are going to have to worry about is whether or not you ever tell your girlfriend about it  Hope you are able to recover from this experience and it just becomes a dumb thing you did because you were bored on January night  You even said yourself you fall for bitches too easily  so why take a shot for one if there's a possibility you're going to spend a big part of your with her  Just because they look hot shouldn't be the reason you're going to try lol i've been skyping with him he's a real personI'm going to just get it out there  I was on birth control  It was 100  effective until this point  And if I'm an idiot for not wanting an abortion  then shit  that sucks  I'm dreading my friends getting married  Mainly because I'll get an invitation with a  1 seeing as all my friends will be at each wedding  I'll have no one to bring so I'll just look even more pathetic than usual  I wonder the same like maybe they might tell each other and maybe they'd never knowStart by trying to understand your parents motivations  They want you to have the best paying job you could possibly get  If you also want this then print out some information showing how you can reach that goal  Show them that your coding and other skills are more then enough to succeed in the best colleges and therefore the best jobs  If they understand that then maybe they wont push you to have all these extra classes that dont help you achieve your actual goal It's a free government phone  That's why my mom made it the emergency phone  not trying to be an ass but that's literally why because it's free   I checked under my bed since the last place was in my room  I checked my closet  I checked in the dark so I can see a light flashing  It's always vibrating and I don't hear anything  I've recently cleaned my room and I fear I threw it out  however that's kinda one in a million    Much  much better since I wouldn't have to worry about girls potentially rejecting me for my inexperience  my biggest fear   Lol   Yes So they'll mail something to me as proof that the lien has been removed   That's pretty much all the questions I have for now   I might have some more questions in the near future about this but you've been extremely helpful   Thank you She's a bitch  Loves to complain about everything  gossips a lot  will hate on you for dumb reasons  Somehow I still find myself thinking of herI have no idea if this is true  but usually  some  credit  never heard of it on debit  card payments can be protected  as in they reverse charges  if you have a good enough reason and they do it   Definitely easiest to ask the bank though  they'll be able to tell you what protection for payments your card has  how it works and what you'd need to do if they do  do it I know  It's just really hard to be told you can go visit him  spend the money  then be told wait actually no you can't go I feel the same way about someone tooI think you're over thinking and projecting your insecurity onto females   Anyone with a active sex life  who isn't a asshole  don't flinch abouts virgins  Because it's not that big of a deal  Thank you for commenting  I'm Indian  my parents are too  so I've been subliminally conditioned to think that community college is bad  or I should say  "not the best option"   Not that they directly tell me that community college is bad I guess I'm just afraid of the future is all    About the essay  Just told my parents about the feedback  They're kind of angry at the teacher for giving such a huge assignment and giving feedback a day and a half before it's due  In other words  I guess fear drove the part when I talked ranted about the essay    I appreciate this advice  I am not a hermit and I spend most of my free time dancing and going out  I am financially stable with a full time job  I am still FA  Based on this will it make a difference Hi  thanks for your response    I'm glad I got one    First of all  May I ask what you were battling with  And how was your relationship with your friends after that one guy revealed it    I have conspiracy theories going on right now  but I think it's all in my head     If they would have asked me if I had boner problems in the past  I wouldn't even have denied it  Hell  if they reacted understanding and respectfully  I wouldn't even mind jokes about it  But that never happened  it was all behind my back  Idk if it's just two of them  Maybe just two of them talking  but it could be everyone who already knows about this shit without knowing about how much it affected affects me  I genuinely doubt that it's only the two of them  I just lost so much respect and trust for them    I'm thinking about confronting them to see how they react  Again  thanks for your response    I'm not sure myself  But quite a few dick heads have been given some real bad luck recently  It's probably coincidental though  If you're still shy you should still try to be more confident and get used to feeling awkward by forcing yourself in uncomfortable situations  Being confident is a great trait to have What is this picture that makes it so bad It went well  I went out and got drunk with friends  My leg muscles still hurt after spending 2 hours messing around a dance floor with the rest of the people I was with  I've had worse nights out I I only masturbate a dozen times a day    i is that too much  They accept all of her but the depressionYou're young  Don't worry too much  My advice is to try everything you're passionate about   You have time to figure things out and don't force yourself to choose one thing only  You could always try taking some music and languages classes while taking physics and maths  or whatever you choose  University is a good time to experiment and try out different things  I tried different courses when I was in university  It might have taken me a bit longer to finish  but I'm glad I tried different things while I could  You don't want to finish school and regret not trying what you love   Remember too that if you decided to study math  for example  you could always pursue music on your own  Whatever you decide  I think it's best to keep your interests open and allow yourself to pursue each of your passions at least in some capacity  Anyway  you won't know what you can do or will want to do until you try  Out of curiosity  do you go out for groceries etc  Or do you get them delivered  I'd be happy for them if I knew it was more of a possibility for me  but when you've just hit 32 with no prospects in sight   yeah  I can be bitter It may help to take even smaller baby steps  By that I mean  don't think about the big picture so much  Get up and do the task that needs doing that day    When you find yourself ruminating  start learning a hard new skill instead  Like Portuguese  or knot time  Or do a bit of volunteer work   You're already taking all the right steps  congratulations Or their high score on Crash BandicootPretty much the EXACT same thing happened to my friend last year  when he was 16   The girl's parents forced her to file the rape accusation  An investigation ensued  and given the video evidence  was dropped  But not before he went to court and some of his good friends had to testify for him  It has been a very hard time for him  and its not something that just goes away  But he has recently found a girlfriend that seems to really care for him  and things are going well  Hes really happy now  I know you may not believe it  but your time will come  You will find a girlfriend that does actually care for you  just give it time  "All you gotta do is lift  and fake it till you make it bro  oh wait  I don't actually have a response to countering your arguments "    every person that gives adivce here   Basically my day today  plus binge eating and crying it's just this dumb picture of me when I was a fat little kid  and when you click on the link  it'll show the "official" website of the stupid YouTube thing we did    plus  one of my friend searched my full name and there it was  it was the front page  UglyAs do I  Fuck  I actually feel kind of better already  "a dumb thing you did because you were bored on a January night" summed it up pretty nicely  and fuck it  lots of people have been through way worse  The title of this post might be a bit rash  methinks   As for whether or not I should tell my GF    I really don't know  I'm guessing that's where the majority of this bad mojo's coming from  and rightly so  but she would not be best pleased if I were to tell her  to say the least  She doesn't even know I've had the slightest inkling of wanting to fellate another guy  and I don't know how she'd react if I told her that the desire had been there in the first place  let alone the fact that I went through with it  and in the way that I did  Fuuuuuuuck my life That's all bots thereConsistently right  Let me know when you figure out that abortion is legal   K thanks I see  That definitely puts more pressure  Life happens and people do things differently  I know this dude that is attending community college pursuing a degree in computer science and is currently working as a manager for a big company earning like  20 hr and he will transfer in the near future to get that bachelor degree  I'm just saying you are not screwed  Just hang on  Ugly   I know plenty of short guys that do well   Awkward is a bit tougher  but there's a few girls out there that would find it quirky and endearing   Ugly   Nope   No niche market for simply being unsightly I'm so sorry that you feel excluded by people in your community  I feel like the gender binary is so engrained in us socially that it's hard for people to understand people beyond the binary  Keep your head up  and keep fighting to be heard  If you want to avoid conflict  that's understandable  Just keep being unapologetically yourself  and hopefully by knowing you  people will learn from you    Also  semi unrelated  but if you haven't heard of Sam Escobar  they identify as non binary  and they're a beauty editor  I think they work for bustle now  Anyway  they might be a good person to follow  They've written some good articles about identifying as non binary    Sending you good vibes  how do u be confident  cus im working on making friends and confidence shows  GOD BLESS YOU       It's probably half curiosity  half imagination   I do this too   It's kind of fun  actually   I see a few redditors around and I imagine that they're just as awesome in real life  and then it makes me happy that such cool people exist It's all about that face  bout that face  No lifting I like the fact that you refuse to kill that meme  I honestly can't say  It's different for everyone I think  If I had to guess based on your situation and age  I would say no  that it's not going to help you find a girl or be with more women    But  it can't hurt to try  again  that's just my guess  who knows  it may help you  Honestly  the part I like is that men tend to respect me more  It's hard to articulate what this is like  but it is noticeable  The Chad types especially become more respectful  I guess they just assume you are more like them    It's also just cool being stronger and more athletic than most people  I guess my point is just don't think it's going to magically solve your problems with women  it probably won't  Cool OP here  Sorry for the late response  This is really good advice and I think I want to give it a try That's the usual response to such questions on Reddit I suppose I should have elaborated   They're married  yes  They bought this house last year and wanted a roommate  so I relocated to the area  and I've been living here almost a year and a half  So really  I've got no complaints  the first two months was a little touch and go  me and the husband are basically lifelong friends  I had only met her a few times prior to moving up   but we all really get along now I think   I know we talked about the possibility of me moving out  because his daughter is almost old enough to choose where she wants to live  and I had said when she's old enough  I want to be ready to move out  so that if she does want to live here  I won't even factor into that   I feel like they've kind of latched onto the idea of me moving out  though   It's hardly mean  and I don't take any offense over them wanting their own house to themselves  And if things DID get bad for me again  I feel like I could count on them if I had to move back  even if it meant sleeping on a couch for a while   It's more that  I suppose this is a natural progression for my life  but I don't feel comfortable or ready  They're both outgoing people  and while I'm naturally kind of a hermit who prefers playing video games  they really inspire me to go out with them and other friends  I worry that without my roommates  I'm going to slip back into

" And then went on to talk about how I'm always depressed  He knew how bad it was so I had no idea why he'd just say it out like that  I trusted him  For a pretty long time up until then  I'm still talking to the guy since I've known him for so long and I don't really care for it anymore  just a thing of the past really and I think he realises he fucked up  holding grudges isn't healthy and I

Either the "I'd let him rape me" or "he can't be a rapist he's hot" line   The frightening part is this  what if he really did rape someone   How many women would take the "he can't be a rapists b c

living farther outside the city and was a bit isolated  so I had to make more of an effort to come into the city and visit friends  But  I liked being on my own and being able to do what I wanted when I wanted to do it  Now actually I do have a roommate and I live in the city  but I'd rather live on my own again  I miss just doing my own thing  If your roommates are good friends they should still invite you over and invite you to hang out with their your friends   I think it's good to have the experience of living on your own  because it shows you that you are able to do it on your own  If it happens  you'll just have to make more of an effort to get out  but otherwise you'll probably like it  If you get lonely too you can always get a pet    I figured  The profile pictures make it obvious too I think the generalized term for this  is disassociation     Go see a therapistUgly  Nobody likes ugly girls or boys That's similar to how I felt when I started  I'd say give it a try  To be more confident you need to force yourself in situations you're not comfortable in  Try to pick up hobbies you're interested in and go to places that you like  That means you're in environments where others are interested in the same things as you  Trying to make new friends can be hard but if you like things in particular so will others and that is how you begin a healthy friendship A good layout and storage space  You can redecorate as you wish but you can't easily change a screwed up floor plan  For the storage   imagine yourself moving in to the house with your camping skiing sport gear and try to figure out where it would be stored  Also imagine you're coming home with more people  in winter clothes with grocery bags   is there room by the door to even fit in  Another ascpect would be neighbours  You can fix anything in your house but you won't be able to fix a fucked up neighbour  If there is one on the street all other neighbors will mention that if you engage in a conversation with them when viewing the house well the good part is you understand what the core of your problem is  hope you'll be able to tackle your situation OP  always keep your hopes up  You can't persuade an ignorant  unintelligent asshat  Exactly   this   Well I want someone to at least know my name in I'm area and say Hi from time to time    that would be a nice start   but I guess it's still asking too much apparently  I don't think you're an idiot  You can tell him and try to raise the child with him or alone  Or you can always give the child up for adoption  There are many  many good people looking to adopt and might be in a better place to raise a child than you are right now    I would recommend speaking to your doctor  as well as your local department of child services if you are considering going up the child  If you are wanting to keep the child  talk to him and your folks    Good luck and I hope everything works out well for youLook it up in a mapBut how can I know that it's the path to finding my future family  rather than ending up dead of some emotionally over wrought conflict This might sound shitty but if this doesn't change the way you feel about her it's probably for the best if you don't  It's a big secret to hold onto but if it's a one time thing I wouldn't tell her  It could be traumatic for her and if she reacts poorly everyone you know could find out If you're super concerned then I guess you could go to your doctor but dude two  stitches   no one's gonna care  Don't let something that was done years ago control your sex life my man Thank you    What the fuck  darlin "It'll happen when you least expect it "You have to "love yourself" and shower When the walls of deception finally collapse and you can see the world clearly to the horizon  you may feel fear and you may feel loss  but life opens up for you anew  As long as you're not naked or doing g some horrible sexual act I think you should be fine  Just be careful next time when putting photos on the interwebsYou sound very experienced and rational  your advice helped me think more clearly about all of this  I hope you handled your depression and you're doing fine     Maybe I'll respond tomorrow to report how everything went  Take care  and thank you  Watch this video and know the experience of Patients of Paras hospital Gurgaon  They have shared their reviews in the most generous manner  Visit to watch Right  I understand what you're saying  And here's the problem  I think you and I are talking things we've read online without a specific example  So chances are if we were to sit down and compare headlines  sometimes we'd agree that the poster was using the most natural language as you suggest  while other times we'd agree that it seemed like the person was going out of his her way to mention that SO   But that said  I think your response is a bit demeaning to us  and I realize that this includes you   We don't live in some world apart  We live in the real world with other people  So we know what sounds natural and what doesn't  We know that there are times when it feels normal that a person just mentioned his her SO  and there are other times when it feels like the person is saying  ask me about my girlfriend   Now that said  sometimes we're just being overly sensitive  but sometimes it's true that they actually probably are going out of their way   As to it being "nothing to gloat about because relationships are normal for 'normies' " I don't think that these are well adjusted adults in their 30s who have been in relationships for years  I think many of these posts are by younger people who are testing out the way "my girlfriend" feels to write for the first time  And I know the feeling  I remember going to a bar once and telling the bartender about going out on a date  and it's just weirdly exciting to feel like you're  part of that world   to quote Ariel   And I think a lot of people do it on reddit because it's sufficiently anonymous to not have their friends teasing about it   I dunno  If I had a girlfriend  I'd bring it up unnecessarily  When something like that happens  you just want to tell the world  Could you talk to a school counselor about this  It might help to talk to someone about what's going on  to get a neutral professional adult's view on this  Why don't you want to live with your dad instead  It sounds like that'd be a safer environment for you   My brother was a bit like yours growing up and I was terrified  too  He'd grab knives during arguments and threaten or attempt suicide and physical attacks  Do you think your mom or dad could be contributing to his behavior at all   I'm dumbstruck when I think back to the stress I had to deal with as a child   life doesn't have to be and shouldn't be like that  On the bright side  your days in this environment are numbered  this will end  Looking back I wish I had an adult to talk to when I was your age  I think it would've done me good  and if you find someone you trust in real life to talk to I think it'd do you a lot of good as well  When you grow up with someone who's this much of a terror it can affect you in ways you don't even realize  the strangest things become normal to you  I still get emotional when I think about the mean things my brother has said to my mother over the years  It's a difficult thing for anyone to process  let alone a kid   If your guidance counselor is more school problems oriented  would your parents be open to you seeing a counselor outside school  You could even say it's for school related stress or something  If there's no one in real life you can talk to you can PM me to vent if you don't think that's weird   Look out for your safety until one of you moves out  Trust your instincts  defer to him  but roll your eyes internally  to keep yourself safe from his bullying  This is all temporary and your safety should be paramount TIL not masturbating to and molesting kids makes me a SJW  Thanks Reddit fairy  And actually you can get the fuck away from me    seeing as you're responding to my comment Which ever subreddit you put it on    still selfish and horrible    Thanks for the insight  Admittedly  I don't really schedule study time and it didn't help that I jam packed my schedule with other obligations    And as for mental health  I'm not sure if it really is an issue or an excuse I'm making up  I've had quite the anxiety over this and now 2 nights before leaving for this internship  I can't get to bed continuing to ruminate over it   History and anthropology stick out to me Think about your future  thank about your   baby's   future  I get that he wants to be single and join the coast guard  but it is his child  He got you pregnant  Don't self sacrifice  think about your own well being and especially the baby  He needs to know  and don't choose being a single parent over not letting your child have a father Lol  ugly by far  Trust me  I'm a lucky guy who happens to be all 3 Ok so you're shy  getting a shit pay  but you're happy  Move to a higher paying job  where you won't be happy  Honestly  if you're happy stick to what you know  If you're looking to become more confident perhaps giving the other place a chance is worth it since it forces you to be in a different environment making you come out of your shell a little more  I'm sure if you're a good enough worker the other school will take you back anyway if you don't like it To be honest I envy how he could care about something more than money than other people   No one cares about me but I care about no one caring  about me and it's just hell I just don't understand how thinking confidentally translates into dates  As long as I smile  make eye contact  not say anything very negative  and not slouch over   people have no idea that I'm bitter and I hate being single Tell them  please please please tell them  Even if you think it's corny  even if you're embarrassed to say it  do it  Sometimes "I love you"s can feel robotic after they've been said so many times  and it's important to share with your SO how much they've impacted you    Congrats to you both and I hope your relationship continues on strong    Tough situation man  there's a part of me that thinks that your brothers not aware of the emotional damage he's causing your family   I can relate to some of the things you say about your brother  the talk of suicide and dark subjects etc  and especially about the anger   his lack of apologies  For some reason I've always found it incredibly hard to physically say the words "sorry" to family members  same with happy birthday etc     If I was in your situation  I would start building myself up with  something like boxing  the confidence it will give you is phenomenal   Over time as you develop your skills  your confidence will soar and he will become much less intimidating  allowing you to have a greater influence on his actions   I think it's important to be mindful never to abuse this potential newfound power and use it as a form of revenge   You're clearly a smart guy and I'm confident you'll come to a good resolution  keep your head up and don't give up   If you need anything just let me know     University was a much better experience for me than high school  While I had no friends for most of that time  at least other students didn't bully or mock me  and the workload kept me occupied    Try to take at least a few classes that expose you to new cultures and ways of thinking  such as anthropology  history  and philosophy   Understanding that FAs' situation is usually the product of a particular society's system of values  not of something inherently and fundamentally wrong with us as individuals  can be very empowering  I guess I should consider myself "lucky" that none of the people getting married will think about me when inviting people You don't even have to be good looking  just a mass murderer   Anders Breivik is kinda average    except for his body count   Ok seriously  he does get a lot of  love letters  http   www thelocal no 20120618 breivik gets love letters from 16 year old girls  Thank you so much  We didn't have a perfect relationship  But I know now that we loved each other the way imperfect people do They want to see your reaction to some topic  So smile to indicate when you are happy   Two things to avoid  long delays in showing any facial expressions when they want a reaction  and also expressionless face  At least in USA Maybe you should talk to a counsellor or psychologist or something  It sounds like your way of thinking is off and they could help to train your brain to think in a healthy way  Yeah I can't see it either   There's plenty of men in Hollywood or male models who I can look at them and see why women find them handsome   But this guy isn't one of them And just because someone asks someone out  it doesn't me they aren't lonely and insecure on the inside   especially when you keep getting rejected  I've sent plenty of messages or expressed interest with guys  gay here   and have gotten "not my type" or ignored over and over again This may not be what you want  however  ever thought about going to a community college   For sure they'll accept you if you transfer   Keep your head up I don't agree   Everyone should donate your organs but making it default is like the government saying "If you don't want to donate your bank account to the government  you need to fill out the paperwork saying you don't want that   It isn't hard to check a box on the back of your license   so I made sure to read up on some open ended questions the night before  What ones If anything it's made me value her more  and appreciate how much she actually means to me  which might sound odd considering the context  but I guess it makes sense  I hate being dishonest with anyone  especially her  but you're right  it's way too much of a liability for this to be any more public than I've already made it with this post  Thanks   r ruhl1981  you da real OG One can only take so much rejection and "not my type" before faking confidence is either not worth it or just a joke  That isn't the point   It should be yours to choose to not to choose not to  Your house will not someday too that doesn't mean I have the right to just take it before it does  How much money do you make off of a site like that  I agree with the shower part  OP  convert your room into a shower and just shower as much as possible   If that doesn't work  try a different type of shampoo or something   But  to address your question    I don't know  I used to want an emotional relationship really badly  but now that desire has kinda fizzled out  and I feel fine for the most part  I don't know why it happened  I wonder that myself a lot    how some people are seemingly fine without an emotional relationship    and who are fine being alone  I know a person in my life who is  voluntarily  FA  and she says she has no intention of changing things It's getting your foot in the door that's the hard part  Attractive people don't have this obstacle  I'm in same shape lately  Just fapping  reading  binge eating   ignoring my hobbies  It's definitely depression caused from lack of romantic sexual interest in me One group that many didn't list is Fozzey   VanC  They speak to the FA within me  I like music that is sad and depressing because it comes from the heart  and every word sung or rapped is real  Because it is theft   What if he wanted his body donated to science   Or he had a brother way down on the list that needed a heart but the government already took the heart and gave it to someone else   Or the guy family knows he has a rare disease that will effect the recepiant that the doctors likely won't catch but they already stuck them in everyone without asking   Wouldn't that be so wonderful if it really worked like that  Man  I so wish it was that easy  Unfortunately  that's not a solution for depression   Telling me that I only have 80 years and I'm wasting it away actually does the opposite of what you intend  It makes me feel worse    because you are right  And I'm already 30 dammit   But instead of it pepping me up and making me want to get out there and change it  it digs me into a deeper pit of despair  It's a terrible  vicious cycle  and I'm afraid you only understand it if you've dealt with it yourself   Thank you though for trying to help  Hopefully for someone out there that strategy works and helps them  Yea I think it's just a case of leaving his parents  However  you say his parents have physical and mental illnesses which is why he wants to live near them  How bad are these illnesses  If it wasn't for that I think he should move closer to you It doesn't  Only actions  body language  and words can be portrayed to others  Your thoughts inside your head cannot exactly be seen You don't your family does  What  specifically did you do to fake it I really hope I can lose the desire and just be content with how I am now instead of wishful thinking You don't your family does Thank you for this post  I recently came to terms about someone I've hung out with on and off the last couple years  This recent new years confirmed every nagging doubt I had about our "friendship"  that he is a manipulative creep  I guess toxic friends can crop up at any age Its pseudoephedrine  Its what they make meth with  Perhaps ask about getting legal meth adderall    But it has the same or worse crash  There are other stimulants that don't crash so hard and have no potential for abuse  Vyvanse is one I was on  However stimulants almost always increase anxiety  And they dont really go with sedatives   I don't think it could cause such drastic changes though  Perhaps it was the alleviation of the cold symptoms combined with the slight 'upper' boost pseudoephedrine causes  Not to mention it probably negated the effects of the sedative you are on  So you went from sick and low to well and high   By the way  what has your psychiatrist done with you  Does he she just prescribe meds or is there therapy education about your condition You could try alternative education like a sudbury school  That or you could have him checked for add or adhd or that kind of thing     you need to fill out the paperwork saying you don't want that    in my state and many others the opt in for donation is literally ticking a box  there is no 'paperwork'    and you don't need your organs when you're dead  there is no reason for this not to be an opt out situation What if he wanted his body donated to science  Or he had a brother way down on the list that needed a heart but the government already took the heart and gave it to someone else  Or the guy family knows he has a rare disease that will effect the recepiant that the doctors likely won't catch but they already stuck them in everyone without asking    The food you bought isn't yours I had very fun with swtor in the past  especially when I had a guild  I had to quit to try to get my studies to work but now when studying has failed it's hard to get back into the game It is funny in this day and age where people accept a lot of random things  people being gay  people being trans or whatever   But God forbid   someone has crippling depression and anxiety   People need to wake up and realize that depression anxiety can be very serious and should respect it more What advice are you looking for   Some people are just not forward types  If she enjoys the conversation it'll just have to be you starting them You read the post wrong     I clearly agreed with him  I was saying if you're balding  being shredded is a must have  otherwise you will look like one of the two things I stated Figure out a passion hobby you like and explore it  Cooking  writing or whatever We are talking out out here   You don't need your bank account when you die so I can have that right   I am an organ donor but opt out is immoral  I'm really sorry you went through all that as a child  It must have been very traumatic  You really should seek professional help with this  You haven't done anything wrong  but I'm worried that what you went through as a child is still affecting you  A professional can help you work through your feelings  Best of luck thumbs up emoticon   Don't be afraid of heart ache   Expect it  it will happen at some point at some level   It won't destroy you   You will survive it  grow from it and move on   I wish you luck   If she isn't "it" know that there is another out there who is      and right now she is looking for you too   You have a feeling you were abused by your dad  or in general  And he did what in public  This response helped me thoroughly  Thank you  I'm so sorry for your loss Yeah  the way you wrote it sounds like you could be agreeing or disagreeing Yo you're letting yourself be in a shitty situation  You need to separate from that

could donate plasma  I used to do that in college when I was short on money  If you're 16 you can work in most states and if you receive tips you can make the cash in no time  Things aren't so bad  PM me if you need more advice I feel for your GF if you can't handle your liquor and end up mouthing off and getting violent with her I had a guy  gay here  chat with me  sounded very nice  everything was great  Then he referred to "downtown"  but everyone here in Charlotte calls it uptown which tipped me off  Then he sent me pics of sculptures he allegedly made  but didn't realize the power of reverse image search online    Actually you do need your bank account after you die  burials and funerals cost money also your family needs to be provided for  Your organs can be used by others when you die otherwise they are rotting away doing nothing  there is literally no reason for a dead person to keep them    How in the world is it 'immoral'   this makes no sense at all  Me tooWoah   I wasn't expecting a response at all when I posted this convoluted mess  Thank you for taking your time to respond   The reason why I avoid conflict is because I have trouble knowing how to respond when it comes to strong subjects  I have no idea what to say at all and end up completely flunking on explaining myself or just not responding at all   It's true though  You're right  The most I can do is to continue being myself  unapologetically  It's just getting more difficult for me to keep up with my optimism and enthusiasm for the community    Thankfully I have some peers at work that have learned about people like me existing  and the most recent issue on Nat Geo is one of the best  most inclusive articles I've ever read on gender  I used that article as support to accurately describe what I am  I want to use the same article to describe   I should also check out this Sam fellow    thank you for mentioning them  You should take it  They won't just dump you in the role without

wouldn't happen to go to an IB school too Hello fellow redditor  I'm also an aspiring director  First I would like to advise you to quit smoking and all that type of stuff  it seriously damages your brain and doesn't make you anymore creative in a business that needs creativity  My suggestions are that you stay in school and take upon any drama programs  If you feel like dropping out  search for drama programs in the area  this will look good in your resumé  I also recommend looking for universities that are strictly based on drama and making it into the film business   Another way to be successful is youtube  If you're a good writer and editor you can make short films on youtube and maybe someone will catch an eye and that will open the door for you  Watch this Video talking about 10

sure how it would work but you could at least try file a takedown notice with Google and see if you could get it off their search  It may not work but if companies can pull this shit without proof of anything you may get lucky  I think that there are more than a few points of interest in here   To begin  I think that you need to reconsider what  think  the world "is"   The world  is not  harsh and cruel  The world is the world  There are people in the world who can be harsh and cruel  but they are not the world  There are many other people in the world who enjoy taking care of pets  who like friendship  who like art  science  and nature    This is not a perfect world  but it is a perfect planet   As far as I know  no serious system of philosophy or religion has ever claimed that the world is "perfectly good"  Eastern religions have the Yang energies  Christianity has its "devil"  and every atheist philosopher has something to whine or complain about  I chose to use the words "whine" and "complain" because many philosophers seem to usually complain about social  cultural  or religious conditions while ignoring the much more serious instances of actual "evil" in the world   Either way  most people live in peaceful and orderly conditions  Therefore  it may be of some use for you think of the world as orderly and essentially harmonious  No one is denying the fact that human beings are capable of cruelty  but that is the minority of the total human population  Actually  if you are a polite and reasonable person  your chances of experiencing true cruelty are next to none  Violent  aggressive  and unlawful people are those who have the highest probability of actually experiencing cruelty  As an ordinary person  you should probably concern yourself with paying taxes  going to college  Christmas gifts and personal eating habits and education in general  Let cruel people worry about cruel people  As long as you are abiding by reason  ethics  and social awareness  you should be rather safe    Secondly  you might not wish to accept this fact  but facts are facts  The facts are that you are in this world because your mother had sex  Your mother  just like every woman on this world  just like every man  likes to have consensual sex  Your mother probably likes to have sex  and there is nothing wrong with that  She might not tell you because it is rather inappropriate for mothers to tell their children this kind of things  but she might very well want men to chase her  I don't think that woman like to be cat called or harassed  but women  human beings in general  like to feel beautiful and under the right circumstance  and by the right people  like to feel sexually desired  We are all here because our parents had sex  There is nothing wrong with liking sex    When you say  or write  that " she will be pursued by men of all types"  what you mean to suggest is that  she is attractive to men of all types   That is really not a bad a thing  She is 50 years old  she a is a full grown woman  She knows how to take care of herself  she doesn't need her son to play the role of a babysitter or a husband    I can assure you that she knows what she likes much better than you do  so it doesn't really matter   how you feel about her being  pursued by men of all types    I really don't mean to be offensive in the least  or at all  However  I suggest that you do some soul searching  some introspection  and mature  What some people may call "growing up"   You are about 20 years of age I am assuming  you really shouldn't be worrying about getting too close to your mother at this age  What you should be thinking about  is maturing and constructing  or developing  a life of your own  I do not mean to be harsh  but no one can reasonably claim that you  should  be worrying about such things You're qualified to answer  this is the best response in the whole thread  with the most actionable advice by far Bummer the very sameHis dad doesnt like driving on the interstate and in order to get to where i live you have to drive in the interstate so thats part if the reason he doesnt want to move here  Also  his mom has ms and his dad mainly has problems with his legs  However  my moms in kidney  and heart failure along with copd  And my dads had two strokes in his brain along with a heart attack he got lifelined because of  I dont understand how hes thinking of proposing when he cant even get his mind right  I mean he tells me im being selfish  He wants to move into the middle  However  i dont like change i just moved from a huge city to a small little town and he wants me to move to another area im not familiar with At this point  it might be best to just tell him that you've become too busy with your personal life and that he might need to find someone else  I don't think it would hurt to tip the police off  but I understand the compromising position this might put you in  especially considering his priors  Good luck  OP same  don't really leave my room  don't really socialize  nobody will even notice I am gone  I have literally defriended people on social media and they never noticed  Even worse is when they accuse me of ignoring them  when in reality I messaged them countless times with no replies  The only people who feel impacted are just little kids  because I am probably emotionally stunted immature so I have the same childish interests  Playing with toys and watching cartoons  They usually think I am fun to be around with and like it when they or I visit  It does feel nice when they want to hang out again  But then they grow old and forget about me  It's only natural Have you ever had warm fish salad More places need to do this     hear me Ontario  The point is to stop the flow of posts that belong in other subreddits  Would you make posts complaining of foot pain in a forum for paraplegics Hey bud  I've just stumbled onto  r incels and I have to say after looking around a bit you are by fucking far the worst person I've ever seen in all my years  I'm overweight and I get laid pretty frequently  I can make people laugh and I don't spend all my time bitching about being fat  So this is what I want for you friend  I hope you do end up being crazy ripped by 2018  with diet and excersize it's a possibility but more realistically it'll be a slow process like it has been with me because fatties have bad self control  and you still can't find anyone because you portray the worst personality I have ever had the misfortune to experience  Good day sir They just invalidated everything so called "third wave feminism" is fighting against lolI suggest calling once you know they finished dinner  Maybe 7 or 8 pm  Once you get that initial call you can always ask when the best time would be and maybe if they want to go get lunch or something soon  if you live close  you never know until you try  Worse case scenario is you call at the wrong time and leave a voice mail explaining that you want to talk more  Most family is very understanding and probably would like you to call more also    Hope I could help Figured  How you holding up  I'm doing surprisingly well Hes not molesting kids  But my pleasure  The thread is deleted  thus I lost all interest in these commentsFinish high school at least  I know it's tough  but you'll be making the rest of your ENTIRE life tough if you don't  A high school diploma is the bare minimum here in the U S at your job  or family of friends  or friends of family  If your introverted chances are online dating or meeting strangers in bars isn't really going to lead to much success  Also online dating has a lot of silent rejection  people will just ignore your messages  or reply at first and then ignore your messages  or will set up a date and then stand you up and ignore your messages or they go on the date with you perhaps even several dates and then ignore your messages  If you meet someone through work or your friend family social networks the rejection will typically be less harsh and less likely to traumatize you One way could be to just get rid of all the junk food that tempts you around that time  If hunger is an issue  stock up on healthier foods like apples or what not  I'm curious to see if you find a solution that works  Good luck I think your boyfriend should move near you then  Paras hospital Video covers Patients review about the doctors  hospital  and the services they have recived I can't say I've ever had any kind of fish salad hes totally crying in the pics This is actually not as uncommon as you would think with single mothers raising kids   The thing is he hasn't got anyone who can challenge him properly so he uses fear and intimation to get his own way because it works    My girlfriends friend has this exact situation and she's a mental health nurse  she's said there's times when she feels powerless because he just goes around smashing things and threatening her and him with knives etc   This will get worse without a doubt   Is there any chance your dad would consider taking him on  It would help you all since the dads likely to be in less due to work and the challenge for him is taken away   Other than that even with medication it is still pretty bad and your just gonna have to stay out of his way as much as possible  What he wants is confrontation but that just leads to him getting frustrated and resorting to violence  The key is not to challenge  its a good pic but damn piss in the bathroom at least Try it m8Just thinking about it  Back rubs and feet rubs  4 5 6 sodas a day  Fountain  of course  Cooking  cleaning and working two jobs  Doing his fucking laundry  And I got mocked for being stressed and tired  He made fun of me when I asked him to be a little nice  Never ever went and got me medicine when I was sick af  Not once did he go out of his way for me  He yelled me as I was miscarry ing  And every fucking time I started bettering myself  he had to hold me down harder  Not this time  Fuck that nonsense  37 isn't dead  Fuck  Fuck  So sad  that just made me cry    I am so sorry  I know how it feels to think  "I will just tell her tomorrow"  Or to smile at the thought of knowing that you will get to see her everyday for the rest of forever  Until you see her laying on the side of the freeway  If you're better  you're better  There isn't a difference between some street drugs and 'medicine' other than how safe it is to consume  Some people are hyper sensitive to pseudoephedrine  you could be one of them  I literally can't take sudafed  it shoots my blood pressure to 200 and makes me feel like I'm dying    Its literally meth    Dextroamphetamine is what adderall is  and meth is methamphetamine      I got this mixed up  I'm not clear on the specifics other than they're all amphetamines     If you snort adderall  the effects are very similar to crystal meth  No it isn't dangerous if taken as prescribed  The danger with crystal meth comes with the abuse and when the dealers make it they use dangerous chemicals   Personally I find anxiety easier to deal with than depression  I can 'logic' myself out of anxiety but its much more difficult with depression  Sedatives are literally depressants  and stimulants are literally the opposite  So its no surprise you felt your world turn around  The question is whether or not that is sustainable and if you can deal with the anxiety if it comes back  So definitely ask your psych about it I feel dumb  Do it  Here's a little secret  everyone feels like a fraud and no one feels ready  They see you as being capable and responsible because you are  It's dissociation  It's a coping mechanism  I struggle with it   in addition to bipolar disorder and I guess ADD  What OP is describing sounds too familiar  What I interpreted about it is that we are trying too hard to be nice to people  We are just too nice Congrats   I'm pretty close to where you are  Never been in a romantic relationship before  I'm ok socially  but very few friends  Recently I've been feeling lonely like I'm missing something  Seeing other couples makes me feel depressed since I don't have something like that or have never actually experienced anything like    I've been curious about Tinder  but wasn't really sure  I'm glad it worked out for you so far and gave you that experience  Just reading this makes me want to try tomorrow  You have passed a huge obstacle and I hope that I can I pass it one day just like you  I'm moving around the middle of the month so I think I'll try it once I settle in    Truly  thanks for writing this  For me  the biggest part is the motivation  Thank you  You comment means a lot to me  Happy I'm not alone  It's funny you mention getting a hobby  I've been saving up for a Marcy Power Rack to state weightlifting  I also want to get into shape so I can gain confidence with women  I'm too shy and introvert to join a gym  I'm afraid I'll embarrass myself accidentally dropping a bench or something haha    We're upset because  despite being a criminal gang banger  this guy has done absolutely nothing to become very successful in life   I think it's more like we're upset because we're being lied to   "Being nice is the minimum "  Uh    no it's obviously fucking not   Lied to during our youth about how character matters when it doesn't  or at least not very much     Unless of course you realize that most people see character and looks as the same thing He's already said he wouldnt  He says that even if my parenta let him move in with me hed probably say no because he doesnt want to be controled by me or my parents when he wants to do something  Which to me makes it seem sketchy  I see it now  Poor Pepe  Im glad I'm not alone     I telling another user who answered that I've even thinking about weightlifting too  I'm saving up for a Marcy Power Rack from Academy     I think that's the shadowAdded to my 2017 list of attempts 6pm Weekdays  8am

Text them and ask them that question  No one knows the answer but them Considering his age I'd say Longleat Safari Park  It's pretty amazing but depending on how your travelling it can be pretty expensive  I appreciate  Firstly  I'm her daughter  I hope I didn't have any oedipal tones in there   Not saying you implied that    I didn't mean to say "No men should be around her "  I just worry  She watches the Investigation channel and LifeTime network like it's a religion  I hate it  she is overly paranoid about men in my life  but the fact that she watches it and sometimes I'll watch it with her worries me  Maybe because those channels show nothing but the "actual evil" in the world  As you said     She is 50 years old  she is a full grown woman  She knows how to take care of herself   You're right  She has for most of her life    For the rest of what you say  I believe you've now made me realize that my outlook towards the world can be somewhat negative when it regards my mother  I can't stand the idea of her getting scammed  bamboozled  confused  tricked  lied to    Perhaps I'm being too overly protective of her  I just love her so much  I can't believe I spent my teenage years being an asshole to her  She's so precious to me    I love your intro  And I do need to do some more soul searching  though I will say I'm very introspective  I will admit that I'm not completely mature    Thank you How do people let you know that they don't want to hear you speak any more on a topic Good on you man  Get some gains Yeah  that what i was thinking   but it would be great if she showed some interest instead of nothing    i will never confront her   Or shame her for not doing the first move because that not who i am    just a little confused of the situationI did not  I was all set and ready with how I was going to handle the cops  Which would basically have been "Am I being detained "  if not  leave  If so  wasn't going to say shit to them  It seems absolutely insane that meth  the drug my mom took  which turned her into a complete monster leading to all of this  can help me  UPDATE  Sorry it took a bit  This thread was still dead by the time I'd landed  Was not arrested  just walked off the plane and went home  The pilot made an anouncement right after it happened "Blah blah we have 45 minutes till we land blah blah  Also  the flight attendant smelled smoke in the bathroom  This is a reminder to not smoke  We're not going to divert the plane this time " Seemed like a close call to them landing the plane and then having me escorted off  FYI  this was Delta Airlines  flying in the US  http   www last fm user mantihorAs long as you realize that what you did was cheating  I don't think she needs to know about it as long as it's never done again without her permission Watch this video where a paras hospital Patient speaks his heart out about the treatment and the recovery It isn't a shitty question at all  It's shitty of you to assume that people know anything about your life  It's a perfectly valid question Well  you are also long distance  so she's probably not that invested in your relationship  Just have to see what happens when you meet in person   Try to take your mind off of her a little bit more so you're not over analyzing her responses  Get into more hobbies and friends Idk I'm gonna try and sound as non offending as possible but I think it's a little sketchy that you gotta keep giving him money because things keep happening I don't know much so I'm trying to not sound horrible it's just my first thought  I can't see how things gonna get fixed I think it's just a matter of patience to see who gives in at this point  My sisters boyfriend moved into our house and he was with us for two years and it was fine   That must suck  sorry  Living with someone else is a massive strain on the relationship at first because you aren't used to having that person around 24 7   When me and my girlfriend bought our first flat together we had been dating for  2 years and we still had a couple of big arguments  At one point the stress even broke us up for a few days   She moved back home and I've been living on my own since pretty much but we are still together and she is slowly moving back in again   Point being  you need to take it slow if this is gonna work at all  It may sound silly but the most minor of shit becomes a bigger deal than it should Oh thank goodness your plane didn't crash  What happened  How'd it go   Edit  I saw the update below  Glad it turned out okay You could both move in with other people  if you don't want to rush the relationship   Take turns staying over at each others' place     You aren't getting married  but there's a lot you need to work through if you're going to live together  more than if you were living with other people   Boyfriend and girlfriend together are never "just roommates "  How practical things are handled in the apartment becomes more personal  Since you are choosing to keep the baby  that baby is now your first priority  Your baby needs support from both of its parents  You have to tell him and make sure that he is taking care of the child that he helped create  Also  what if you didn't tell him and he found out years later  He would be really angry with you  So would your child  You have to do the right thing for your family  Tell him as soon as possible so that he can make the decisions that he needs to make sure that he is being a responsible father Don't run away from your problems  You really can't just vanish unless you travel abroad Nah none for us Americans sadly Yeah  I read your post and I felt a little weird about telling you that  But it is what it is  Anything can be bad for you if used incorrectly YW  OC  I think my college has some professional counselors  I'll try setting up an appointment  I don't know if I could articulate my problems very well though  I start to choke up whenever I talk about it Don't forget  ill be watching                              Like seriously Im watching you right now But    one may have to deal with the family and culture  after  the ceremony   As a wise woman    who is fact part Vietnamese  but also French    told me  "Marriage is a process  not an event " Thank you for the advice   NopeThank you for the advice    I really appreciate the explanation  I was baffled and had no idea what was happening  It's comforting that there's there's some logic involved now  So glad for you  That's very sweet  congrats Something I think might help with your assignments is to maybe ask your teachers questions about each assignment before you start it  Like make sure you really understand what's being asked of you  Sure it might seem kind of annoying tedious at first  but I'm sure it will start to get better and things will start to make sense  School doesn't come easily for everyone  Are you American  Because I know American public education really needs to improve  Not everyone learns the same as everyone else  I really think you will improve if you communicate better with your teachers and make it known that you are trying  And don't stress out too much about college  like the other person stated  there is absolutely nothing shameful about community college    Third year college student here    Don't be afraid to ask me any questions if you ever need to talk  Then that's where I would goWhat kind of conferences do HS kids go to You might not see it this way now  but your parents are trying to do what they think is best  They know you are capable of great things  and they feel like they need to push you to achieve these things  They realize it takes a lot to stand out from the crowd and they're not only thinking about your fellow students as competition  but every other kid applying to the same schools you are   If you want them to be reasonable with you and allow you some freedom to relax a little and be with your friends  I recommend being reasonable with them  Approach your parents calmly and maturely and talk to them about their concerns and your concerns and explain to them that you need some balance from the stress of studying  If you approach them as an adult they'll be more apt to treat you like an adult I am 28  it depends on their mood  my dad tends to be more critical  when hes upset  he says stuff like "we raised you for what  your 30 years old and you can't even take care of yourself  do you want me to support you until I am 70 " or "why don't you do it my way  I have decades of experience  if you did this at work your boss would fire you  why can't you learn to do things right " or "you are not polite or generous  you will lose all your friends and family"  fun fact I already have no friends and don't communicate with most of my relatives anyway so moot point  and then he says only a crazy person doesn't have any friends  or "is there any point in doing           are you getting paid for it " hes referring to my hobbies  when hes in a better mood  he will say the optimistic gibberish  "even volunteering would be good  at least you get out more and meet new people " or "there's plenty of good women out there "  my mom mostly just says the optimistic stuff my dad says   when I brought up therapy because im not normal  im a loser who doesn't want to do anything in life  they said im completely normal and nothings wrong with me  even though my dad likes to complain im worthless  and that therapy is stupid and all they do is just talk to you and feed you pills that makes you stupid  now my mom is more open to the idea of therapy but keeps telling me I have to figure it out by myself  If I could figure it out by myself I would have done so over a decade ago  I am not motivated to do anything  they just don't seem to understand that  Family members that try to help just tell me about some job openings and tell me to apply for jobs  They completely ignore that there is something wrong with me  At most they will say I need to shave my beard and cut my hair because no woman will date me  looking like this  or nobody will hire me looking like this  Nobody will date me period  nobody will hire me period  and I don't blame them  I am indeed a useless sack of meat  When my parents pass  I am just going to find a way to join them  Well after I use up whatever money they leave behind  I did work briefly but only because a relative got me the job  I saved up the money since my parents pay all the bills  I was eventually fired for being anti social and overall terrible employee  Lazy  always late  anti social so I didn't answer the phones or communicate with clients  I pretty much just sat there twiddling my thumbs half the time  Even if someone was so desperate that they would resort to hiring me  I would probably feel guilty because I know I will be the absolute worse employee ever  I just want to sleep and never wake up  but then I will miss all the mindnumbing media  Like the upcoming 200 comic book movies I guess it is kind of fun  I swear it only happens when it feels like they've noticed me too  Idk if that makes sense lolthat gave me a good laugh  I didn't mean he pissed his pants  but I was referring to what appears to be his piss bottles  or are those bottles of juice  I don't like to leave my room but I still pee in the toilet You can't control or break luck but you can deal with it  Life's pretty shitty with you at this point and I can see that  If you just want to forget about your problems for a while or illeviate stress working out or playing games is a fun way to pass the time  If you want to stay happy the key to success is by having enough will power to deal with the shit you get given head on  You could always find a new hobby or something but I don't know what you mean by breaking 'bad luck' "Hi  I'm xxxxxxxx   I think I recognize you from the last time I was out around here   I really dig your style   Any chance you'd like to walk with me a bit   Maybe help me find a descent coffee shop or something "It'd be nice if you'd give me the details on why you'd want to run away I'm going to tell you this right now   under no circumstances are you to let her know this within the first 3 months  if it happens to last that long   Though I recommend you wait 6 months to a year At 29 I prefer a girl that's younger then me  It's weird how a couple months ago I got downvoted to oblivion for talking about a crush I had on a coworker and once a close friend  that's 20  Now that age difference seems to perfectly acceptable by everyone in here  Funny how time changes people   As for why  Hard to say really  In all honesty I seem to connect better with younger people for some reason then with people my own age  all younger people aren't ignorant morons like everyone want's to believe   Perhaps it's where I work at or perhaps it's the fact everyone seems to think I look and act like I'm 18  Nothing really  He might have talents that we don't know about  but it's clear as day when you look him up that everything he got was for his looks  Fame  job  and the mansion car  I just   life is weird man I think the more important goal for you is to find out what it is that is on the mind of the people you're talking to  and let them lead the conversation honestly i think i stopped developing past a 20 year old mind  i like people in general more in their early 20's   It sounds like it'll help your self confidence  probably   The important thing with lifting  or any exercise really  is to find a way to make yourself enjoy it   Otherwise  you won't stick with it   Are you following a workout program at all  or are you just going and trying to learn the ropes hey  check out  this song  https   youtu be dQw4w9WgXcQ They'll only outright say it if I know them well enough for it to be okay  Sometimes people will clearly get bored of it  There is probably a way of determining before it gets too late though What if you're all three  I'm two for three  not short   It's an unreal feeling  isn't it   I've got the most amazing partner next to me right now snoring like a buzz saw  And it's like a lullaby to meNo do not pay  thats one shitty fucking "friend" drop her I don't think I always want to let other people lead  I have things to say too Lose his number and let it go because you have nothing to gain in this situation   What will likely happen is he will frame you as crazy and thirsty and convince her that he only wants her   The best way to get back at him is to stay happy and content   You dodged a bullet If you lent someone money and they avoid paying you back  you just paid that person to gtfo of your life  Perhaps for the better  less mooching to deal withGenerally  the people we glance at first in a group situation are the people we feel closest to   Not necessarily to gauge their reaction  but to exchange non verbal cues   Each situation is different   Sometimes the cue is a request  "help me out in this argument  please "    Sometimes it's a question  "did he just say what I think he said "    Sometimes it's a command  "don't you dare say that thing I know you want to say"     Non verbal communication in these situations is not just about subtlety  but also about context  The same expression can me different things depending on the context of the conversation   There are no easy answers here lifting is worth the effort if only for the health benefits and the sense of accomplishment in my opinionUse Dxtory to record your videos  I can hook you up with a partnership on YouTube so you start making that money  Also  I make banners and YouTube avatars  PM me for more details I used to be like that  You just need to develop a moral code  Then you can use your skills at subterfuge and manipulation for good   What really helped me was the realization that I have a very high IQ  Not bragging  It led me to believe that because my mental faculties are above average I should hold myself to higher standards  Like the Spiderman "great power comes with great responsibility" thing    Also  develop your self esteem  If you have a high opinion of yourself you need to live up to that image Damn man this is awesome  I felt a lot of similar things you did  and as you noted  there's something about using Tinder as a sort of ice breaker to the dating scene that's so powerful    Keep your confidence high  make sure you hit the gym and eat healthy  buy some decent fitting clothes and you'll be killing it  Congrats Sometimes a fresh start would be really nice  but it's not as easy as it sounds  There's two possible ways of doing it  but I really want to know what's causing you to consider this ThanksAWW MY MAN BECOMING A GANGSTER THUG LIFE CHOSE YOU  Contact the police  Don't tell him you did though ffs don't  Just like  delay him by saying you're a little busy now and will get back soon Try to get your mind off the processes of interacting  but rather focus your mind on the subject at hand   Do you have a question about the topic   If not  consider asking how the other person about their feelings about the topic   If the topic bores you  steer the conversation to why it excites THEM   If it doesn't excite them  ask them what does   What's on their mind    If there is something on your mind  use lulls in the conversation to change the topic If you find yourself talking about the same stuff over and over again  it's because you're dominating too many conversations   Either that  or your social circle is comprised of clones Tell him  You didn't get yourself pregnant  these are the consequences of being an adult  Tell him the first 3 mons are risky and it may not take  But be ready in case  If the partner is working 70 80 hours a week  which is very taxing considering there's only 39 hours left in the week for them after an average of 7 hours of sleep a night  I'd consider asking him her if they're able to continue committing to the relationship   First off  it's extremely unhealthy to work those hours and if the partner's priority is work  we'll they'll be too tired to do anything else which is understandable Pottery  Might help her get into a hobby she might enjoy and can sell it as well  I took xanax and prozac at the same time in 2014  I dont remember how much dose for prozac but 0 25mg for xanax  For me  there was nothing wrong with taking it together  It may cause some drowsiness and sleepiness  but probably that is a common side effect of xanax  I took prozac in the morning and xanax before I go to sleep though Why not be me and all 3 So  remember two things   One  doctors are not infallible  It's possible they incorrectly diagnosed you when you were younger   Two  medical stuff is rarely exact  It's quite possible that on the day you visited the doctor  there was nothing they could detect that would indicate to them that you actually had asthma or something like that   Because of the persistence of your symptoms  the fact that it responded to whatever that was you talk  and what I wrote above  to me it would make the most sense to see a doctor again  and if your country or insurance allows it  I would recommend a pulmonary specialist  In either case  it might not be bad to try a different doctor than the original one  But if you trust them a lot  you could go to them again and explain the additional information you have learned   It certainly sounds like a medical issue  so I would lean towards continuing to seek medical help   Good luck If you don't want to be immediately available  then don't be immediately available  Whats the worst possible thing that those people are going to do if you don't respond right away  They'll bitch at you  but they'll just have to get used to it   If you're not a person who needs to constantly have pr like a youtube celebrity  then why not take breaks If she likes gardening  pot is always a good seller    Y'know if it's legal there  Is this friend of the opposite sex Stress  depression  family girl trouble  college being almost impossible  and a mixture of a ton of other thingsThat sounds a bit like nerves  I'm sure this internship is important to you  and you want to do well  It seems to me like a confidence thing for you more than anything else  The fact is  you just won't know how it will go until you get there  You simply can't spend time worrying about whether you belong there  They hired you  so you belong  full stop  Just try to make the most of it I used to steal from family and manipulate but now I have a morality which has recently been taking a beating but it's still thereI just want to get away from everything  Out of sight out of mind  I think could live a solitary life  What are the 2 ways If she is only alive because of you  try to make her think of the people that love her   You could always go on r suicidewatch and address your situation there as people are more suited for this kind of stuff and more immediate action is taken place over there The next time you are making out  grab his hand and put it where you want it You have a way with words  College can be more expensive than child support and court can order that plus other expenses if the child is a full time student   People can't qualify for financial aid without parents participating so they can be forced to participate     It sounds like your family members may be offering to share with you some of their medications  Although it's well intentioned  it can be harmful to you  so please do not take anyone else's prescription    wait until you get to see a psychiatrist for the prescription  Meanwhile  if necessary  is it possible to call your former doctor and ask about some supplemental sleep aid  e g  melatonin  Yeah my family is religious I'm atheist I don't believe there's someone up there and I don't believe you need to go somewhere every week and give them money just you can be "blessed" and make "god" happy so when you die you end up in some Happy placeJust a advise next time if u lend someone one ask something of equal value  So even if he doesnt give back ur money and u dont want to friend with him u can sell it  I know it is a cruel to do so he brought this on himself  I was sarcastically answering the previous comment  CAre they going to put them on a list with an app like sex offenders in the US She wouldn't have an issue finding a guy to take her virginity  even landwhale women have options unlike  say  fat men lmao Good luck with it  I am sorry women on okc rated 80  of men "below average"  while men's votes were a damn perfect Bell curveHey  just wanted to say thank you for this comment  You're absolutely right  even though it's hard   I need to move on   Thank you   QueenIt's not really fair to the child for you to not offer the father a choice whether to be there or not   Well there must be a reason why   like something that either just happened or something that's been slowly been building up   In a nutshell  you can either just drop everything and leave  running away  or you can move away and do it quietly  Obviously they both sound similar  but one involves leaving with what you can carry while the other is a more formal approach  I assume she's on some sort of SSRI then  Unfortunately  an SSRI by itself is akin to a band aide and is not a long term solution without proper therapy  I don't know what internal barriers she has to overcome but most colleges have counselors and therapists available for free  Has she had a therapist in the past before going on SSRI's  someone who might have taught her some therapy methods  If not  I suggest reading the Worry Cure or downloading a CBT app like Pacifica  it's free   Exercise  mindfulness techniques and a proper balanced diet may also help  You mentioned that she's off her meds right now  Did she talk to her PCP before doing so and did she do so without slowly easing into it  Whenever you stop your medication  you might deal with side effects  which may include increased anxiety  I hope that she gets the help and support that she needs     I know that those aren't ways to convince her parents but your girlfriend has to take the first step and sometimes  contacting a mental health professional can make things more official  When you're talking to a PCP  it might make her problems seem physical rather than mental  Does that make sense  It's hard but she needs to demonstrate to them that she needs their support and have a heart to heart talk about it  Sometimes  that means for them to see what she is going through with their own eyes He also is covered in white stains are you saying you are covered in cum stains What's with the white supremacist frog     sDo you even have a plan  Life might seem hard now but everyone goes through this shit  I once had severe depression and I thought as no one cared for me  I felt isolated and contemplated terrible things  Infact  I even went on this forum with a throw away account and said the exact the same you're saying  Though I was told otherwise  so I stuck it out  I went through it and gritted my teeth  Run away is not always the best option trust me  It's not that I'm changing the topic and saying "screw you we're talking about this now"  it's just that other people aren't saying anything  and when I try to make conversation  I end up reusing topics I think swtor and EvE are the only MMOs I haven't played Lifting will make you ripped and women only like lean ripped guys so depending on your face  height  shoulder length  etc you can become a total pussy slayer  Source  fat guy  never had a girlfriend or kiss  will die alone That depends on your situations   Best way to do it is by following the generic outline where you state that you're only saying whatever it is you're saying because you care for them   Being straightforward in a calm and polite manner is key   Avoid developing a condescending tone  Hope this helped    You can pay attention to conversational cues  like are people's responses very short or no responses at all  Are people's attentions wandering from you  are they looking around the room  Or decide a set amount of time that you're going to talk about a subject This    Pissbottles are so

movies  new shows  new technology coming out  or any news that isn't related to politics   reddit's front page has plenty for you to go on Hey  so I'm gifted  but super fuckin lazy  You're gifted  too  but your parents are pushing you to make the most of it  Don't hate them too much for it  because you could very easily turn out like me if they didn't  Maybe don't go the physics comp  but keep at the 24 7 studying  This part of your life is all about investment  You're investing and sacrificing now so that you can get the payoff later  And trust me  the payoff is great  It's awesome making good money  And I only make "lazy but smart" level money  You'll make way more   Maybe slack a little  but overall  your parents are right  People today are lazy  useless sacks of shit  Don't use your friends as a measure stick for what's an acceptable level of uselessness  because I can guarantee they're too useless   Work ethic is important  It's the entire reason Asians dominate in America even

Resident Temporary Pacemaker Implantation  Visit to watch it now Yup The 2nd option doesn't seem to fully dissolve all past problems  I think I would rather option 1  so you know the best way to prepare for something like that I just find that doing this a lot makes it easy to make a habit of suppressing emotions  which can build up a lot of stress   Sorry for the delayed response fortunately not all countries put trial verdicts in the hands of random strangers with the accountability of a catIt's only rape if he's unnattactive    sthey are one and the sameI'm not sure  a couple years ago I was stubborn  rude  overly confident and my walls were way too high for where they needed to be  I'm not sure why I was like this but it definitely was a cover up to try and not get hurt or disappointed I guess  and now that I've completely changed since then I'm out of my shell and like I said anxious around people  And I don't want to have to take my friends everywhere because that really doesn't help it only makes me feel like I have my backups  you know   I want to be confident and still me but I guess i just care to much about want people think Nothing that nice lifting session in the shower couldn't fix  That's because he's attractive  I think the idea of an end point is the wrong way to go about these things  The "goal" should be to become a person who is constantly getting better  There is no finished  perfect person  we all have room for growth  I believe that our "ideal self" isn't a specific person  but a process of constant growth and self improvement Oh I have people that care for me and I know it  That's the issue  everyone sees me as some sort of rock to lean on and let everything out on  this only adds onto my own issuesI think it's

games  you are probably pretty Internet savvy  and perhaps used to problem solving  You can find information about every possible hobby under the sun online   Unfortunately  we don't know the slightest thing about you other than the two things you want to stop doing  So  we would just be shooting in the dark offering you ideas   So  the obvious questions are  what sort of things interest you  Reading  Sport  Arts  Animals  Politics  There are likely to be hobbies around anything you may have a remote interest in    As for quitting the addictions  part of it is just your own discipline  You could start for example by setting a limit for yourself on how much gaming you are allowed to do  So for example  you could start by limiting yourself to two hours a day  then gradually lowering that to one and a half hours  and so on  Don't allow yourself to buy any new games  You could do something similar for weed    To be honest  the nature of weed is probably a complicating factor here  It is probably inhibiting you from the desire to get out and do more stuff  Because  let's face it  when you are high all the time  you pretty much don't want to do anything but sit around   You could also consider trying cold turkey  but that's often a challenge   If you are really really struggling with this  I would suggest talking to a therapist  preferably one who specializes in addictive behaviors  They may be able to give you some better therapy and training around how to quit   Good luck Dear god  revealing a terrible secret while anesthetized is one of my bigger fears  I'm afraid my unconscious body would start reciting tasteless internet content pre operation  with the enraged surgeon deliberately botching the procedure out of disgust     On any given day I'm suppressing a decade worth of jokes on such palatable topics as scat  drugs  rape  gore  Jews and cheese pizza  I don't even know whether I'd blame someone for executing me on the spot if it all came spewing out at once that's way too much inflated to be mainstream attractive and what an example he'll be for them        Now this is a story all about how My life got flipped turned upside down And I'd like to take a minute Just sit right there I'll tell you how I got a mansion  got back  wife kids a job money out of being a felon who got famous over the interwebbzzzyaaaaaIt's like they don't care or I can't get through to them at all  "There are plenty of people single at 24 " Single  yeah  But who have never had a serious relationship ever  Who average 2 3 dates each year that never go anywhere  Who don't get any respect from anyone and whose "friends" don't reply to their texts  No  but they don't get it or they care just as much  The human race is a heap of scum  Certain people are universally respected while others are doomed never to get any respect no matter how hard they try  I feel I would have so much love to offer if only a girl would give me the chance  I'd give her my most heartfelt beautiful love  But because I'm not the first thing that comes to mind when she thinks about her potential boyfriend I get to suffer and die alone Bro that is fucked up  I would tell your mom what's actually going on  I'm surprised your dad still doubted you  but I'm sure your mom will actually believe you when you     Say what's been going on  You can't just keep things between one another as brutal as it may be  Good luck Put it away if you can  Live your life independently of your brother like he doesn't exist  Your parents are obviously dealing with it in their own unconventional way  Don't tell your mum   it won't help  Know in yourself your experiences were real and that you will keep yourself safe in the future  Just move on  You'll be better for itUgly  People look at you and just automatically go "nope "That's great Well running away sure is a pussy move  However  your life I guess  Good luck If worst comes to worst  you can always talk to the teacher The longer they keep brushing things under the rug  the worse things will get     Your mom will resent you guys more the longer she isn't told  It'll break her trust in both of you because "what else are you keeping from me "    Your dad is trying to create a false reality where everything is fine and dandy  The reality of things is that it's not  He's lying via omission  ignoring  his own son  and manipulating you into hiding the truth     Your brother is now living isolated and ostracized by not only the general public but  his own family   Yeah  sexual offense is pretty bad  Like  one of the lowest things one can do  But that's part of his reality every day now  Hopefully he's remorseful  But isolating him is no way to help him heal so that he doesn't do anything like that again     You've been a victim of this stuff all your life  Your best weapon to combat it is the truth  It's a long and painful process  But hiding the truth is straight up poison   All just my two cents  I think there are some benefits to dating a virgin is not a deal breaker at all I wish I knew how to move on  I have talked to multiple therapists about it  tried to ignore it  etc but little things always end up reminding me of it and bringing it back to the front of my mind  I end up paranoidly thinking of how much my brother and my parents interact  like I am doing tonight Every time they talk to you about being a good valuable man and improving ask them    who gets panties thrown at him  and who's gonna die alone    The scientist or Justin Bieber  The engineer or the Ponzi scheme scammer who went to jail The market is already oversaturated  why would they want to make it moreso You should start a journal   Put down all the positive thing you can think about yourself first and than start doing a day emotional check on yourself like 3 times a day   If you still are still down after a couple weeks go seek help therapist or something your comfortable with take the journal with you so you don't forget anything    I can relate about my younger brother  I'm disgustingly ugly  shy  awkward  he's pretty attractive and has no issues with shyness  He has lots of sex and friends and a GF at the moment while I'm a 22 year old Kissless virgin  He's 19 btw  If it's not sexual or anything that'd be a bad mark on your character  I'd just let it go   How is it a pussy moveWhy do you stay    Don't even think about it  Up and leave  He literally  LITERALLY isn't contributing one thing into the relationship  You're being used  Get out  There are people out there who will give back with a smile  A cat is a better companion than this guy Thanks for sharing your experience  I'm really happy for you  I wish you the best   Don't forget to lift in the shower while being yourself  Most guys chase after sex more than women do   without asking   They did ask and you had the choice to say no when you get your ID Driving License student card voting card or whatever it is that you get in France when you turn 18 and they give you the option to   OPT OUT   That's the agony of FA  you can't just stop wanting companionship or a relationship  Coming from a 33 y o hoping to get to where you are some day  thanks for sharing Short answer  no  You are not a pedophile    What you are is a regular person who has experienced some destructive  extreme  and confusing things at a young age from the hands of pedophiles  You have been pushed in the direction of becoming like them  but you can get help  Especially since you know where everything started  and you want to learn how to overcome the after effects of people abusing their influence on you    A professional counselor who is not in a hurry  who does not belittle your experience  and who gives straight answers to questions will be your greatest ally  Fight the good fight  friend  you are not what you have experienced  We having expert hot female therapist giving best services like full body massage in Malviya Nagar  Delhi to our customers you deserve to take time out to care for your mind  body and spirit experience a full body massage in Delhi that's different from the rest You're running away from your problems  You even admitted to how others cared for you and you're running away because of what you're having to deal with when everyone goes through shitty things in their life time Frankly  every funeral is different  I've been to some that were very positive   I'd give it a try   Sit in the back  and if it's too much just slip out and meet up at the reception   Most of the action is at the reception  anyway   Press the flesh and tell his friends and relatives what a great guy he was and how honored you were to have known him   They'll be glad to hear it  you will make a difference  My goal is certainly not for my brother to repair his relationship with my parents  In fact  if that were to happen I would have to get out of my parents life for my own personal health  There was a three year gap inbetween him grooming me and him getting arrested for child porn  He is not remorseful  This is a regular thing for him I never said that  But whatever you're just gonna take whatever I say and make it fit your narrative Any girl 4 10 or higher that you match with is a bot 95  of the time Funerals are for the living  Ask yourself if you will regret not going  Or if you feel you can mourn and send condolences in another way that feels more appropriate to you   The last friend I had who died  I was very nervous for the funeral and so glad I went  I left right after as I didn't want to talk to anyone except his wife  also a friend  We just hugged and cried  I said I was very sorry and that I loved them both  Then I left    But I have skipped some in the past and felt okay about it as well  That one was different  I needed to tell the wife how sorry I was and show her support    Yes  he no longer does any drugs at all  Which is actually something to admire because he seemed to have no hope I'm starting to be more of a burden than anything else though so is it really that bad for me to leaveThis is true  and you are smart to comment this way on this question  It is always harder to be independent  and to think for yourself  than to go with the herd  And the rewards can be greater  but at the cost of social isolation  for example   And other pressures  Some guys like fat girls  I'm guessing by your comment that you don't like fat girls Its a natural reaction  Your doing work but not being paid for it   I was in a similar position myself a couple of years ago  The feeling will pass once you find a proper paid position Fine take my upvote you filthy animalSomethings that help me everyday that I hope will help you   1  Identify your biggest goal  This is the one thing that you wish to achieve  do  be  with your life  It can be anything  but must be the singular most important    2  Only do things that realistically bring you closer to that goal  For example  If your goal is to be an excellent software developer  then hone your coding skills through a hobby  read coding blogs  broaden your experience with software  If your grandest goal is to help others as much as possible through servitude  then start volunteering or pursue a career that has consequence in the lives of others  Regardless of your goal  the point is to put a  purpose  behind your actions  Any purpose will do  Make even your smallest  insignificant actions purposeful and you will find new energy  when brushing my teeth  I do it to impress the woman of my dreams and not just to avoid cavities    3  Stop seeking entertainment  This sounds ridiculous  but will help immensely  When you have nothing to do and have time to spare  resist the urge to simply pass the time by seeking entertainment  We all fall victim to it  and it wastes precious minutes we can spend living  Instead you can go workout to improve health  read a book and improve brain function  or go talk to someone random at a coffee shop and develop a relationship  have had many interesting conversations by initiating random small talk    Yes  the meaning of life is elusive  However  I am 100  sure it has nothing to do with being entertained    I hope this helps  Following these three steps helps me get up every morning and see  why  I do what I do  If we lose sight of why  then our actions become shallow    Oh and unless the drunkard roommate is bringing you any value  find a new roommate More demand for girls    From what I have observed lots of guys like obese women  it's even a famous porn genre   Not a lot of girls would want a big guy  I am big guy but I am short so I am like a bean    I'm 23 and been lifting over 5 years now  my first few years weren't serious but I still went 3 5 times a week   it does not help at all if you're a hermit or have an ugly face  It has literally done nothing for me but increase my body dysmoprhia and keep me somewhat healthy I think this is the best option as well  as a relative and a friend came to a similar conclusion  I'll be following this route  Thanks Just pure disappointment  No drive and no ambition  I could have been so much more  I'm good at everything that doesn't have to do with women  but depression and alcohol addiction   so now I'm just a homeless jobless stoner who plays games all day  I understand why they hate me  I probably would too  Although I moved across Canada  so I most likely won't see them ever again No you see yourself as a burden because you're depressed and stressed  You look through a narrow perspective when you're sad and you feel as if everything is against you and everything is going to shit when it's not  But I can't stop you  go ahead  Leave I don't but it doesn't matter as fat girls can be with men who aren't fat super easy This is a shitty situation   Sorry that you have to be in it    Your parents have a different perspective on how life should be and it sounds like they are not willing to bend much   My advice for what you should do is FAKE IT TIL YOU MAKE IT     Best advice is to be financially independent and make yourself marketable   While that's a broad statement you are a young human being with desires  emotions and natural instincts   You can't just turn these off     For education you are a good candidate for many schools  Aim to go somewhere and get a full ride you can still take out loan money on top of that and even get extra scholarships that will give you financially independence as a freshman   The ivy league or top school stuff is BULL SHIT now    All the information you can ever need is at your fingertips   As a 4th year medical student I bought 1 book in all 4 years and that was for test prep   My class is an amalgamation of people from every type of university and I can assure you where you went to college has little to no impact     Perhaps instead of the physics challenge say that you want to volunteer to help pad your college apps and find things that other people that you like are doing   Find something you really like and make that your passion   Make time for your friends when you can and do whatever it takes to make it through until you can go away for college   If your parents are disappointed in you just brush it off and endure    I am glad you had the courage to ask for advice about this and I hope that you will evaluate what people are saying and make the right choice    I have been thinking of metaphors lately and one that comes to mind and also reflects my own situation is imagine a plate with a big solid rod of shit on it   You are being forced to eat this piece of shit or die   Your actions that benefit you let you shave off small pieces of shit   To succeed you'll have to eat the shit but working hard makes it a smaller piece   GOODLUCK What always gets me is when it's a hot lady teacher  I'm just sitting there wondering what in the hell is wrong that they risk charges of statutory when I'm relatively sure that getting laid without said risk wouldn't be a huge problem for them It always gets better Distance yourself from your friends  until you feel that you are completely over her  and then come back and just take a breather when it comes to being around her  She may be your closest friend  but if you cannot get away from these feelings that you will not be able to move forward  Situations like these always suck  and I'm sorry that they happen to you but you have to give yourself away from her so you can let go of those feelings I'm sorry for your loss   I think I understand how you feel  There are times when we just want to crawl in our shell   Both of my brothers are dead  but I was not close with either   Sometimes I feel guilty about not making more of an effort   You haven't seen your late friend for some time  so in a way your relationship died   Perhaps you also feel a similar guilt   I think the decision to go or not really depends on how you feel about seeing the people you know you will see there  and also what statement your presence or absence will make This is because of hypergamyThis post has been removed    r Health does not allow images  screenshot

got   This is funny and telling on so many levels  Hopefully this girl can match up with you intellectually  Move oni want normies to leaveYou're right  they don't have to attack your character you as a person  but clearly that's a mishap on your communication with the other person  You need to communicate immediately that all you wanted something casual  or just sex before even meeting up with that person  Try fetlife com Yeah  Send it  It would be foolish not to Could be sociopathy or manic behavior    When I have manic episodes I do so much of similar stuff   You would need to see a psychologist   Addictions can make people experience this as can apathetic depression   You can always get into politics   Canadian  Ontario  Realtor here  specifics vary on location but the biggest thing I believe is you need to pick your Realtor in advance  don't wait until you are ready to buy  That way you can get tips to plan for a more informed process  I personally love it when people let me know possible move in the next year  that way I can coach them on what to expect in the proper time frames    Don't sign something with the agent until you have a very good feeling about them  and ask if you can get out of the contract if issues arise   get it in writing  I personally always include that provision    A lot of sales people just push through the process  but I have found that fully informing the client first takes fear away in future as the process can move fast    Don't listen to family only  I have had some armchair realtors  family pretending they know it all  give terrible advice to their family who are looking  If you can't fully trust your professionals opinion get a different one because that's what they are getting paid for    Do not lowball  you will end up paying more for the insult  Find the fair price and go slightly less  using your professionals advice   I have negotiated well over 200 contracts and it always goes smoother when the clients put their full trust in me    Let me know if you want more  I just wanted to jot a few things quick for you   Possibly  But there's nothing wrong with that so long as you don't act on it   This  https   www reddit com r Documentaries comments 5lepx9 inside the life of a virtuous paedophile 2016this   video was posted to  r Documentaries a day ago warning  comments are a mix of supportive and nasty  and  this  http   www virped org   is the website mentioned  you might find it helpful    Also I would be a bit cautious about mentioning this to anyone  even a therapist or family  In the video I linked  the guy's therapist just refused to help him after he talked about his condition  I remember reading somewhere which means  I might be wrong here  that therapists are required to notify police if they think you might be a threat so there's a chance that might happen    However  apparently  if you're in Germany you're in luck   https   www reddit com r worldnews comments 3d6q9m germany encourages pedophilies to sign up for     I also would be careful about telling your family  While there is a chance they might be supportive  there is also a chance they might overreact and do something drastic  Taken straight from the Frequently Asked Questions of  r atheism  "The best place to come out to your parents is at a home you own  over a dinner that you paid for yourself"   https   www reddit com r atheism wiki faq wiki should i come out to my parents as being an atheist 3F  Maybe ask your parents what they think of  non offending  pedophiles and if they respond positively then you can consider telling them    Finally I'd like to tell you to take my advice with a grain of salt  I'm not a professional and even some professionals  are not trained for this    I was about to tell you to not molest children but upon rereading it  decided that it was too offensive  I mean imagine a woman telling a heterosexual person "remember not to rape people"  that's just ridiculous  You know better than that and I should know that you know better than that  Anyway  sorry if I wasn't very helpful despite a wall of text and good luck finding a solution  Edit I put the wrong reply here     Well    I said gtfo   But they have simply wasted my time   And not paid me and then continued to use me further   I even got then a birthday gift   But they avoided me   So they never got it   I know  I'm too nice right    But I'm getting my money back   Then saying gtfo     Right   Right thing to do  They can't claim our friendship is worth anything now  Tbh this girl sounds like a bitch  I'd personally drop it  but if you're going for it  then yeah  you should wait a while until you talk to her Cut the crap  sister  How stupid do you think your EX boyfriend is  He's going to know  immediately  that this baby is just an attempt to trap him in a relationship    If you weren't good enough to make him give a fuck about you  what makes you think he'll give a fuck about your bastard   I bet it isn't even his So let's look at it another way  You defy your father's wishes and tell your mum  First comes denial  she won't want to believe you "you tend to exaggerate"  you'll have to prove it and when faced with proof she will be devastated   Both your parents will then be hurt and angry about the situation and then will have to work through their emotions regarding the fact their son has a serious mental problem    Then how would you feel  when they're grieving  When they distance themselves from both of their kids because they have such emotional turmoil to digest  Will you feel better   will you then feel you can put your brothers attempts to groom you to rest      You were lucky  you weren't beaten  raped  molested or abused  You had a close call with someone who you should have been able to trust  you've lost any normal relationship you could have had with your brother but you're ok  Burn and turn  Go live your life  be independent  be happy and let your parents deal with their own shit because it only needs to be their problem  Well they got me a nice gift at the time   And previously things were OK   Money never had an issue around it     The item I have give for a while I will have back soon that's the agreement   But they've not even had it   They've simply passed it on  before they give it back   So I just feel like I'm a complete idiot the person that has it will be aware it's mine too     I really am     That idiot "friend" now   I'd rather not linger on into my 70's with several health issues when I can go nice and suddenly from a heart attack at 55 Yes     But only friends   I'm a guy she's a girl   But currently doing the whole    "I'm a helpless girl"  You're not a bad guy  In my opinion men and woman who only want sex are bad when they make their partners fall in love with them by acting like they want to be in a long term relationship rather just have sex alone without catching feelings  Its a major mind fuck to be told at the beginning it won't be more than a one stand or FWB   then all of a sudden it changes to a why don't you love me scenario  But you're definitely not wrong to know specifically what you want  If someone can't accept it well too bad for them  More fish in the sea Honestly bro  she matched you based on your honest opinion of yourself  Go with that full throttle  if she doesn't fall for that  she's the wrong girl  Be you and nothing less  don't settle for anyone who "took the bait" That's really great   Keep up that momentum  I wish i knew you personally right now because i'd just like to hold you and tell you everything is alright    Even if he said he just wants his own space for now then it doesn't mean completely that it's not a possibility to still be happy with him    But if he does end up just wanting so be friends at most  you can't blame yourself for that  you're a beautiful individual  and nobody on this planet is just like you  You have talents  many still hidden inside of you that you should seek out  If he wants time to himself than perhaps time to take a step back  take a deep breath  and know deep down that regardless of what you may sometimes think  people think of you as beautiful  and it's what's on the inside that counts  you're a strong  brave  intelligent  beautiful individual  No matter what happens you must know that there will always be ups and downs to life and to know the ups you've gotta have some downs  And that's ok  nothing is perfect  nobody is perfect  At some point everyone feels pain    We're here for you and if you'd need it i'd be more than happy to be there for you whenever you need Could you say this again after getting some sleep This post was reported for being a troll  removed and locked Yeah  Cut her loose  She's obviously stringing you along and she's gonna keep doing it as long as you keep allowing it  Keep calling  Squeaky wheel  Damn  OP I'm really happy for you      CongratsDo it again    And again    And eventually you will become a host  Then it becomes second nature That's pretty fair  You can definitely make being short work  even seen lots of guys do it and have a super fun life  Without having a stellar personally that people love  being ugly is just hard to beat I am a legal assistant but only because I was able to jump into that job because law classes were required for a lot of an international relations useless degree   HOLY FUCK are you correct about how cold and callous those people are   Prior to that  I was an interpreter and traveled and got to interpret at these conferences   I loved the people my age but these nosey Iranian govt officials were nasty and rude   I didn't put enough into it to not change to a trade   I hate some of the "help" my job was to consist of   I have one of those coworkers but it's the passive aggressive über liberal lady who sounds like Sally Struthers   I mostly mediate because I have the Hillary Clinton way of getting the twisted nonsense way of dealing with things there after so long     You sound like a fanatic guy   Her in the other hand    I was voicing some outrage at this the other day  It's horrendous that the comments that could reshape your ways of thinking  are just buried to never be witnessed   One time I tried to explain my  I guess self diagnosed  depression to my mom  She said "well  maybe you should go ahead and kill yourself  That would prove my point that you aren't worth it  Go ahead  I always knew you were crazy " She also calls me "fucking retarded" and gaslights me until i freak out and have a panic attack  She likes to pick on me for no reason  and had never in 21 years apologized to me for any of the hurtful things she says  She treats my sister very well  giving her whatever she wants and never criticizing her    That's terrible   No parent should ever say that to their child We vibed well until this point and she was nice  believe it or not  This actually seems out of character  tbh  I like her  so this is why it's hard  for me  and I don't want to seem weird  You don't think saying something on Twitter after her blocking me on iMessage is overkill I understand what you're saying because I feel the same way  I don't  however  think that's possible since those are pretty much the only two places to do that at  Maybe work  But that's different  You must be above average handsome to nab a date makes me feels so damn anxious Yep   so I said I'll meet her mid   end of January   But I think they'll continue to avoid me     I said we need to meet and talk and they said sure leave it to then   But immediately wanted to know "what it was about"           Well  you owe me money still     Into a lot of those extremes huh    There's a program called DBT that helps some issues with that type of black white thinking I hope that you feel better now   Actually  something to consider may be that your mother is probably  safer  watching those shows and scaring herself into a paranoia which may keep her from going outdoors  Essentially  since she watches so many Crime related TV shows  I am fairly sure and certain that she doesn't go out at night too much  and that she isn't a very trusting person  I am do meant to imply that such a way of living is healthy  but I do mean to suggest that she is properly safe physically because of it   As for the rest of your comment  I think that doing some soul searching  some true introspection  the kind that causes you to change for the better  may be very beneficial for you personal advancement and maturing  It is a nice thing for son's and daughters to be concerned for the well being of their parents  Its quite a nice thing  However  "not being able to stand" to stand the  idea  of her being confused or bamboozled is definitely something which needs to be fixed and corrected  It may help you to realize that when say  or write  that you can't stand the "idea" of something  you are actually expressing the fact that you are reacting negatively to your own thoughts  to your own imagination  Therefore  I suggest that you correct this immediately since it is definitely not a good and healthy habit to develop   Thinking  of something   imagining  something  and then reacting negatively to that thought is something which causes many people a lot of trouble in life  and it is somewhat of a habitual tendency  Therefore  I suggest that you nip this in the bud  or at the root  and quit quite literally imagining things that make you feel anxious  worried  depressed or angry   It is my opinion  and I think a reasonable one  that it is quite healthy and okay for you to imagine anything that makes you feel good and happy  without expecting it to actually become true  For example  if you have romantic partner  I think that it is okay for you to lay in your bedroom  and imagine the two of you going to a beach  being alone on the sandy shores  and walking together into a sort of tropical paradise  and  being happy about  in real life  in your room  as you imagine those things  What I think is not healthy  is to sit in your room imagining find a perfect partner  and then being cheated on and spiraling into a fit of depression and anxiety in real life    There is a healthy use and unhealthy use for thought and imagination  and I can assure you  it is not healthy to actually worry "in real life" about and  imagined scenario  where your mother is confused or bamboozled  Taking this into consideration  and acting appropriately and accordingly  may help you with your romantic relationships also  relationships which you  feel  are "too good to be true"    So  I suggest that use though and imagination a little more healthily and wisely   On a side note  I did suspect that you may have had an Oedipus complex based on your initial post  However  now that I know you are a female  things seem to be a little clearer now  I think that one small issue may be a slight guilt for your teenage years which you may need to get over  I don't know of a single person who was a perfect daughter or son  However  I definitely suggest that you use thought and imagination more healthily  more positively  without expecting it to become true  There are quite a few people in this world who  imagine  that they will win the lottery  and that is probably not very useful or healthy  However  imagining things which make you feel good and happy  "daydreaming" as some might call it  may give you a more positive outlook  view  or perspective on life  and it may provide a certain type of emotional sustenance or vitality   heres a solution  make him watch animals get ripped apart by other animals on youtube  and ask him if he would rather they die painlessly and eaten by humans instea fo being ripped to shreds by other animals How about working on your personality  and not trying to go after super hot chicks   if you have had a relationship with multiple girls  you'd realize they're not as shallow as guys are   stop looking at every1 on social media and thinking if you're not hot like them  that you will be lonely   if you're not hot and then let that affect how your confidence and how you socialize  then you will never be "fun" to be around     your hair is something you can't change   how about making sure you exercise   clean your body face so you look healthy clean   that's prob more important than being short   no hair  you'd be surprised at how many cute girls think the same about themselves because they don't look like that instagram model and feel insecure just like you    and to be honest  if you're balding real bad   shave your head bald and get over it  you may think it looks weird at first  because you're use to seeing hair  but people who have never seen you before won't even notice   and people who do know you will get use to it after a few days   I've went with crazy haircuts when I was younger and some of them clearly didn't work well on me and I had to let it grow recut it back to the way it was  and people got use to it and didn't even bother them that my hair didn't look right when trying to "spike" it up     here's joe rogan talking about being bald   https   www youtube com watch v ktGnSBw9688   and look at him before and after being bald    at first it was a little weird  but now when I see him on live stream  i think being bald looks dope on him   If this sub died  I'd wonder if everyone but me finally had that FA ending success and moved on with their lives Oh shitOne of those incels  So I'm a 19 year old with a 10 year old brother  who I was recently trying to tutor in math  and let me just say I understand your frustration  There were moments where I was trying to explain stuff to him and he'd get distracted or change the subject and completely ignore what I said  and holy hell was it annoying  But  if there's one thing I've learned with a forgetful younger sibling it's that yelling and making them feel bad won't change anything  But you shouldn't feel bad either  you're under a tremendous amount of stress and it sounds like you're trying your best  You're not being unreasonable in cutting his media time nor would you be unreasonable if you cut his iPad time completely  And from what I can see you don't seem like a bad teacher  but if he is having this much trouble with school he may need outside help  Do they offer tutorials at his school  Those are usually free and I figure it'd be worth calling and asking about   And  going back to my yelling point earlier  there are moments when my brother's forgetfulness hurts my feelings so badly that I want nothing than to start a shouting match  but after talking it through with him I realized something  Me yelling  complaining didn't change anything and he was just gonna keep being his forgetful 10 year old self  If he's purposefully ignoring you then yes that's a problem  but if he's just forgetting like most kids do then yelling won't solve the problem  TBH  sometimes even talking calmly doesn't solve the problems  and you just gotta put up with what you're dealt   So as for the school problems  any form of outside help would be the best option  Some research into his school's plans for tutorials would be a good place to start  As for the yelling  frustrations  I don't think yelling makes you a bad teacher or a bad brother but it doesn't sound like it's really helping all that much  I know how frustrating it is to have a forgetful little brother  but as someone who's gone both the yelling route and the calm talking route I've realized that no matter what I do he's always gonna forget what I've taught him told him to do   And in the long run I feel the talking things through route will be better for our sibling relationship  but don't be afraid to get onto him  kids need discipline just maybe don't turn it into a screaming match   From experience yes  band kids are judgey  But here's the thing  why does their opinion matter  As long are there's a genuine connection and relationship between the both of you  there's nothing you should be ashamed of  Besides  band kids love drama more than the theater department I resent the idea that I'm "lucky"  You know nothing about the history of my abuse  because I have experienced literally all those things you listed  They did not all come from my brother  but I have not had whatever carefree life you're picturing me living  I also have no idea what planet you live on where grooming your little sister for sex over many months is not abuse  I do not want your advice anymore  as you make me uncomfortable  Please do not respond I am so sorry for your loss  Hope you find your balance  and that it includes continuing your quest for physical health  Making  a commitment to strive for health is a great way to honor your Dad    Alcohol  No idea what your relationship with it is  mentally or physically  If you think that eliminating it is crucial for you to accomplish a big win over an untimely death then you have your reasons  If not  then maybe the focus on elimination can be subject to revision    Because I will lie to the doc and say I'm okay when I'm not   I don't trust them   I can say that I'll tell them everything  but when I'm sitting across from them I'm too scared and I won't be able to get over the fear that they'll hurt me and that I'm right about everything   I need someone else to tell them that I downplay everything and that I need help  I can't get it on my own   It sounds like I'm doing it on purpose but I'm not  I just get too scared I would give him back his stuff and distance yourself from him    Pretend you got a new job and no longer have time for Craigslist gigs I know exactly how you feel  I was feeling the same way a couple of days ago  Time and acceptance will help it  And hey if you need someone to talk to you've got a reddit friend right here  I can tell you though that after the first week talking about it and thinking about it all the time only makes it worseLong is subjective to the eyes watching  It's mostly what she believed was long  Your next gf will probably understand that  If I may ask  why did she give you a reward Have you considered telling his parents that its your weed and he didnt know about it This is a very unfortunate situation  I don't feel I have the ability to make a good recommendation for you because it doesn't seem like any door leads to a positive outcome   That said  I have some advice for you as a person  Your parents don't need to believe you for you to feel validated as a human being  The truth is the truth  and even if others doubt you it doesn't change the truth  Your parents can live in the land of denial all they want  That's their  choice   Often times in situations like these parents deny the truth because it's easier to do that than come to grips with the fact that someone they created is a predator  Your parents can deny it all they want  but again  truth is truth  If your parents didn't believe in gravity  it wouldn't mean they could jump 50 feet in the air  If your parents don't believe you  it doesn't mean it didn't happen   What your brother did to you is in no way a reflection of you  it's entirely a reflection of him  You're not a bad person   he is  Don't ever blame yourself for something you didn't do and didn't ask for   Be happy  Enjoy your life  Keep at a distance anyone who compromises your value and feel free to cut out the people that don't have your best interests in mind  No one deserves to be able to control you  You deserve to control your life  and anyone who disagrees can go pound sand Agreed I know this all too well  standard advice is seeking help but in the meantime maybe try small goals or changes each day  It's so helpful when all you notice is your body and it's functions  Depends on when you message her  When did you send your last message to her if you over that ex  should it matter  Besides  if your relationship ends with your Ex doesn't mean that your brothers relationship should end with your Ex  I hate it when friends are lost because of a break up  Not going to lie  i hanged out with my Ex best friend for years after breaking up with her and in the end  we hooked up  didn't give a fuck about what my Ex thought So when you came back from Asia  you had the same experience Watch Paras Hospital Darbhanga Video covering the story of a Treated Barhi Resident with Temporary Pacemaker Implantation Thank you for the response    I would really like to get help  I'm not sure what is stopping me other than that looming feeling that nothing will ever change  I know better though Sorry to hear about your loss   It's really difficult losing a parent  I hope you're getting good support from close friends and your family  I think you're doing a wise choice by putting down the bottle and trying to live a healthier lifestyle    It can be difficult hard to explain to people at different events social gathering  that involes alcohol   that you're not interested in drinking  due to several reasons  The best tip I can give you  on this though  is practicing the "answer" to that question in your head  That way it will be easier and feel more "naturally" when replying to that specific question the next time it is being brought up  Instead of feeling awkard the next time you have explain say "no" to a drink    Good luck and you're not alone by making these type of changes  It will pay off in the long run  for sure  I wish you the best You're looking at the wrong comment  PWhy was this post removed Isnt tryng to date those at your office sort of like a faux pas  As in dont do it I can relate to the frustrated feeling of never getting help and no place to turn to  It takes forever to get a therapist these days I will say it one time and I might delete the comment afterward   If I say to anyone  maybe just in person  that I think people are actually not human  I will be right and they will kill me for knowing their secret   The government  people on TV  they're trying to take over the world by pretending to be people   So I can't tell doctors that because they might be like that  and I'm too scared   The more I talk about it the worse it gets   My family doesn't know that it's this bad either because I can't tell them so  what if I'm right and they tell people   And those people are the creatures   I know on some level none of this is real  but sometimes I wonder if I'm just telling myself that so I'm not constantly too afraid to see anyone face to face   I need help so badly and I don't know how to get it because I could be right You replied to ebz37  LeMeuf posted that comment   Be yourself  just not

monster in your pants it'll affirm what she has heard Very true  I am surprised at the amount of effort people put into dating  as in I find it mind blowing  No one wants to be single and some people devote all their free time to dating  or maybe it's every waking moment     Where  I on the other hand have put very little effort into it and have gotten squat  I use to chalk it up to the situation  but in reality  it was largly my fault  In fact  I have gotten more dates when I was actually trying and overweight at the same time then when I was skinny  good looking  and not trying  Go figure   Hobbies or activities that have women in them Other way around  too little  I don't think it could hurt to ask  just be respectful and honest about it     You could say something like   "Hey       I realize you're still undecided on what you want us to be  but I didn't want you to miss out on an opportunity I think you'd really enjoy   Also  it sounds like a good chance to have fun aside from just hooking up  might give you a better idea of how well you two mesh  and what potential is there I've tried telling people   I told my mom and dad that I thought aliens wanted to kill me and were stalking me   They took it seriously I think  but didn't have me committed   I told a psychiatrist that I was delusional about aliens and that I was paranoid   He said  "I don't really see that " Aka

I've given up on relationships  I just want to be happy with my life as it is  If only that were possibleHow long is enough 5 ten 10 years without a date  All the time having your confidence struck down to zero again and again to the point where not being able to date becomes the greatest source of unhappiness and insecurity in your life   People give up on their dreams all the time  Why is love

AnimeNerd To be honest we can give advice but it comes down to your own morals  I probably wouldn't out him if I was in your situation unless I knew he was a scumbag or a repeat offender when it comes to chaeting  because if he is telling the truth he never truly cheated Well worded and well thought out    Thank you so so much    I went through your history and noted that you tend to help others as well  You deserve this and I hope that everything in your life is going well  I know right now it feels like your head will never clear  but it will  I've had post concussion syndrome for two years now  and for the first four months it was HELL  I felt like my brain was boiling  had constant migraines  couldn't remember shit which got me in trouble at work      It gets better  The fog will gradually lift  so you can do this You DO know man  it is obvious that it is better for you and your dad or just you to tell her rather than her find out on the web  She deserves to know ASAP there is literally no reason to hide this from herI've been through a similar thing with a former friend  and I never saw the money again  There isn't a lot you can do about it    The option I see as workable is contacting the persons family  explaining with records my expenses and explaining how I am now out of pocket due to their lack of any responsibility for their actions and asking they settle this issue   Depends on the family I suppose  but very few people will tolerate collectors going after them for somebody else's debt  Implying that the debt is somehow the responsibility of the family will probably only anger them  Wouldn't it upset you   Something I considered doing to my friend was subtly letting his friends and family know about his behaviour  including the girls he was interested in   He obviously didn't care what I thought  but maybe if his entire social circle realised what a scumbag he was  he might be motivated to redeem himself  In the end  I decided that it wasn't worth it  My friend was broke  alcoholic and rapidly gaining weight  and I didn't want to be the person who tried to starve him of social support during a potentially critical period in his life  I still don't know whether that was the right thing  but as  u rockoholik13 says  it's payment for him to gtfo my life    They repeatedly said to me "let's forget about all that and just move on like it didn't happen"   When I hear that I think it means let's go back to friends     So I've been trying to make an effort and make time   Often when people speak ambiguously like this it's because they are being deceptive  By filling in the blanks regarding your friend's intentions  you may find you are participating in your own deception  In other words  because it was  your  mind that made this connection  the notion that your friend values your friendship feels more credible to you  If he she had simply stated his this outright  you would be more likely to doubt it because prior experience taught you that he she could not be trusted  Manipulative people learn to exploit others with these kinds of techniques    Should I be done with this fake friend  And stop the tag along  be my friend     I find the whole thing stressful and I don't want to be horrible but this is getting ridiculous   Definitely  The only time this person bothers to have a meaningful interaction with you is in relation to borrowing more stuff  You make it sound like the money was for something fairly frivolous anyway  As much as it sucks to lose so much money  this is hopefully a mistake that you will make only once in your life it works   you need to measure everything in exact days then add days as virgin then reconvert to years   2017 year of birth  365 25    1 month of birth  30 4375   2 day of birth   days of

Who knows what'll happen   Agreed as well  No harm in asking See if they will agree to your fostering a dog as a trial period  If everything goes well  once the foster is adopted  you get your own dog

I might be talking about it too much though  I guess I can try reading other kinds of news and see what there is to talk about Apparently it is possible  because otherwise  how could you be happy without a relationship  And if you aren't happy alone  you won't be able to be in a good relationship Unless you've literally been shouting to the hills that you have a huge dick yourself  just be confident and play it as you would if none of it happened Visit and Explore the video about Paras Hospital Darbhanga talking about the Treated Barhi Resident with Temporary Pacemaker Implantation Yeah it's kinda impossible to ask someone who's never been in a relationship to feel that they don't need one  Because you can't make that jump when you don't know what you're missing in the first place  I think that advice only really applies for someone coming off of a breakup  not a KV type start video taping while she changes  title it "cuck in the wild shedding it's skin " now the serious answer  rofl buy cameras and set them up  breaking and entering  get a restraining order and simply file a lawsuit if you get video evidence of her on your property or near it Unsure what country you are in so laws can be different  but in my opinion she is too young and as much as it might hurt you  you need to forget about it So I'm being kept from 2 of my half siblings  little brother and little sister  by a father who just likes to fuck with my life  I haven't seen them in a year and a half and I completely understand your pain  and not a day goes by that I don't think about them  I also know how scary the thought of them turning out like their father can be  But when dealing with someone as unreasonable and unrepentant as your stepfather  or my father  I've realized that once they decide to leave you out of their life they won't let you back in  It hurts and the realization that I may not see my brother until he's probably somewhere between the ages of 16 to 18 hurts me  and that's even if my dad hasn't poisoned his thoughts by then    In the end  kids always discover the truth and whoever's meant to be in your life will eventually find their way back in  It hurts  and it will continue to hurt  but if there's nothing you can do to change it then you'll just have to wait it out unfortunately   "If you can't fix it  you just gotta stand it " I'm sorry but the link to the video seems broken  is there a mirror Take it dude Dude I cant tell you what to do  but I know if that were me  I would stir up shit so hard  They just tell you they doubt you or do not believe it because they dont want to deal with it and think they fucked up as parents some how  They didnt but now they fucking are  I would point that shit out and make it god damn clear that the longer they tru to cover for a fucking pedophile at your expense  the more likely you are going to get to the point that you will cut them off when you get older  You did not do anything wrong  you didnt asl for this shit  and now its time to pull their heads out of their asses nefpre they lose both their fucking kids  Yes tell your mom  and yes  flup the fuck out at your dad  because damn him for destroying you emotionally because he does not want to deal  All of this shit was totally at your expense  and now they need to act like the adults they are supposed to be  suck it up  and fucking take it  They owe you more than an apology  Get pissed It's like they want to start a conversation but have no ideas so they awkwardly  hopefully pass the responsibility to you  But usually I'm content with the silence so I'm kind of wondering if that's a problem or a simple observation  I guess I'll never know because I've never felt the need to say something like that She's overreacting  It's a fucking emoji  Even I could tell you weren't being serious since no one should take emojis serious  You do youI know how you feel  I  being 16 and dumb  let my ex boyfriend do things to me while I was basically blackout drunk  Even though I said no a million times he didn't stop  and the next day I rationalized it saying since he's my boyfriend he's allowed to do those things  and I somehow convinced myself that it was okay when it was not at all  You feel violated but feel like you have no right to be  Have you thought about seeing a counselor about this  You have every right to press charges if that is what you want  Talking to a professional can put your thoughts into place and help you think clearly about what you want to do about the situation  It doesn't matter if you dated or not  he should have never done those things to you    Put yourself first always  and do things that make you happy  Time and self love will get you through the bad times and make yourself some good times  You are worth so much more than the pain he has caused you  and you can get through this  We all handle trauma differently  Maybe you thought you would feel better about the rape if you dated the guy  When I was raped I continued to talk to the guy and hooked up with him after because I was so confused about my emotions  Try not to let this affect you  this link should help you  https

North America Mexico   But yeah  that is the most reasonable approach  And again  that's not necessarily all I'm looking for How was itFuck no  Never do this again Yeah  I don't know  Back in 2008  I made a New Year's resolution to get a girlfriend  I had just lost a bunch of weight  and that was supposed to catapult me to success  not because of the increased attractiveness  but because of the amazing confidence boost   But I didn't feel confident  of course  I was disappointed that I never met my goal weight  which was the high end of what the BMI says is 'normal'  not something ridiculous   and I still had no experience with any woman being interested in me at all   But the much bigger thing was just that I wasn't meeting anybody  I mean  I went to Meetups  Most of the people were guys  The girls were sort of aloof  Many had boyfriends  And of course  I had no idea how to flirt  I had no idea how to make girls interested in me  And if there was an attractive woman who I met  I really couldn't imagine her being interested in me  and a lot of the time I wasn't really interested in her either  Our personalities just didn't mesh   These days I meet a lot more women  It's mostly because I started taking dance classes  though I'm not trying to get you to do that necessarily  The thing where I can't imagine them being interested in me still is a problem  And it's not that I can't imagine  any  women being interested in me  It's a problem because it takes me 10 weeks of knowing someone before I think I have a shot with her  and by then she's already lost interest if she had any to begin with  and I've probably met 50 other women who disappeared into the ether without me knowing them well enough to think I could ask them out  Also  I think dancing makes women act more flirtatious with men  even if they're not actually interested in dating them  It's just one of those things Then I guess that's something you're just going to have to deal with  Because if you're going on a date with someone and you haven't told them ahead of time then you just want casual sex and they're suddenly surprised  some communication has not been fully read "Confidence" works in the short term and is essentially just a measurement of your degree of narcissism  If you ACT like you're better than everyone else then other people assume you have things that make you so  That's why it works for good looking men and not for ugly men because looks value  If you have no value but ACT like you do  people figure it out  generally fairly quickly  and then you're just an asshole  That's why the "nice guy" dynamic exists  People like us HAVE to be nice  that's one of the few things we can control to add value to ourselves  When women complain about "there's no good guys out there" it really means "There's no hot guys  who have good status AND a good personality " Think about it like the olympics  can you jump over 1 8m  Nice you can join the olympics  Doesn't mean you'll win  especially at that height   but  you can TRY  We are the people who can't jump 1 8m  We get to watch at home  and high five them for doing stuff we can't  We aren't even in the running  we don't get to TRY  So it doesn't matter how amazing your "winning speech" or "victory pose" or "sportsmanship" are  you still can't jump that high  Obviously the bar for getting a GF and winning the fucking olympics isn't at the same height  women are generally much shorter than even the qualifying heights  but it's the same principle  I must have missed a letter when copying  i've edited the linkIt's a faux pas  but frankly  I think if you're on this sub  the value of a relationship that actually worked with a coworker would outweigh the problems Idk but that sucks Hey really sorry to hear about what happened  I'd recommend trying to apply to another university to see if what your teacher said is true  It may not actually turn out as badly as your professor wanted you to think  I've also had a teacher come after me in high school when I avoided a test by going on a field trip  He made me take the test a day before everyone and then emailed my parents about the situation  He tried to make it seem a lot worse than it actually was  but really nothing come of it  I still think about it sometimes and don't totally understand why he acted that way  It was the first time I encountered a vigilante that tried to make my life miserable because he believed that I had done something wrong  and it made me question myself a lot  My advice is to not dwell on the idea that you are the type of person who does bad things  which is not true  It seems like you are worrying too much about what that professor thinks  because he scared you so much by chasing you down  Figure out the real facts of your situation before you do anything  don't just burn because that's what this professor wants you to do  Good luck and will pray that everything will settle down Normie logic  You forgot to add " s " that could explain the downvotes Well  you hear it all the time here and even more on subs where FA types tragically tell their stories to the larger reddit community  who are mostly assholes  let's be honest  honestly  not badThanks Did you eat it afterwards hmm  perhaps both our responses are clues as to why we're both in FA      She felt like she wasted my time because we never did anything beyond kissing  I think  So she spread the wordI'd say give it till morning  tomorrow  or the day after Yo  I'm sorry to see you in a bad situation with whatever you're going through  I can't promise

reddit  No one needs your unhelpful and unnecessary negativity  Watch this video of Paras Hospital Darbhanga talks about how they have cured a patient suffering from heart disease  visit to watch now How long has she been with her long distance boyfriend  I feel like timing can be a huge factor   Side note  don't string the other girl along anymore if you are not interested in her  No one wants to be a backup plan Tinder He is a repeat offender  He's done this multiple times to me personally and bashed his now girlfriend who was his ex at the time  calling her a "judgmental bitch" among other things and then trying to get back with me  and then I find out two days later he is with her  This has occurred more than once  It's understandable that they'd be tired with those work hours  and it's kind of normal for things to calm down a bit in a relationship after a while   but   sending a text message or making a phone call to check in isn't that hard to do  You have to wonder whether the relationship is really a priority to them right now  Maybe have a conversation about this and ask your partner instead of internet strangers   we can only speculate as we don't know every detail of the situation  Definitely uglyI know this was five months ago but can I ask how this turned out for you  I'm kind of in the same situation  extremely similar to yours Disturbing lack of hip hop for the top comment I've been through a similar thing with a former friend  and I never saw the money again  There isn't a lot you can do about it     The option I see as workable is contacting the persons family  explaining with records my expenses and explaining how I am now out of pocket due to their lack of any responsibility for their actions and asking they settle this issue    Depends on the family I suppose  but very few people will tolerate collectors going after them for somebody else's debt  Implying that the debt is somehow the responsibility of the family will probably only anger them  Wouldn't it upset you   Well this person is away from home and living in another country   They come from a   let's say a restrictive background due to culture and religion   And it seems to be the only way I can get through to them   I previously said I would contact family and ask for my money back   But then I got the manipulative    " is that what our friendship is worth   I told you I would pay"      Something I considered doing to my friend was subtly letting his friends and family know about his behaviour  including the girls he was interested in   He obviously didn't care what I thought  but maybe if his entire social circle realised what a scumbag he was  he might be motivated to redeem himself  In the end  I decided that it wasn't worth it  My friend was broke  alcoholic and rapidly gaining weight  and I didn't want to be the person who tried to starve him of social support during a potentially critical period in his life  I still don't know whether that was the right thing  but as  u rockoholik13 says  it's payment for him to gtfo my life   Well to be honest this person isn't really struggling or on a downward spiral   They are doing quite OK   It just pains me   I helped being a kind friend   probably was their best friend and it's all just fell apart to this       They repeatedly said to me "let's forget about all that and just move on like it didn't happen"   When I hear that I think it means let's go back to friends     So I've been trying to make an effort and make time    Often when people speak ambiguously like this it's because they are being deceptive  By filling in the blanks regarding your friend's intentions  you may find you are participating in your own deception  In other words  because it was  your  mind that made this connection  the notion that your friend values your friendship feels more credible to you  If he she had simply stated his this outright  you would be more likely to doubt it because prior experience taught you that he she could not be trusted  Manipulative people learn to exploit others with these kinds of techniques   Well interestingly when I sat with them to go through things   I said I didn't want any drama around this   And asked what "going back to what we had"  meant   I said I hope it didn't mean stick around while I don't pay you   And they told me I was over thinking things and was confused   Which made me laugh a lot  At this point I gave up and left because the conversation was going nowhere    Bad situation really   Anyway I just hope I can get them to act and pay me back I just don't think after everything I can just disappear off and be walked all over like this  I think a lot of her close friends make her decisions for her and advise her badly    I just don't understand why people would rather throw their body in the fire or be eaten by worms  than share it with fellow humans and save lives  As a spiritual person I see it as my duty  let nothing go to waste  But at least the worms will feast for free on your corpse      Oh and you never share your food  Ownership is an illusion  Bot central I  look sickly at normal body fat and skinny weight  I can only imagine how handsome I'd look if I had 8  fat  DI think it was better before I tried  Back then I had some hope that if I actually tried  things would be ok  Then I tried  and of course it was with a girl who wasn't very attractive  but I was  sure  she was interested  Well  she wasn't  and that of course unleashed a spiral of self loathing  Yeah  it was better when I had that innocence I understand your point   and a long time ago I felt the same way   Then I was cheated on              What you'r not realizing is that when humans bond  the bonds are complex and pervasive  They impact our emotional selves in very profound ways  We start building our identity  our sense of who we are  based in part on how this other person sees us   This person thinks we are the most amazing lover  the most wonderful person  he or she hates being separated from us          And we define ourselves based on these things   And then when we find out it was a lie  when we find out that our lover loves someone else       it's devastating       If it had been a really strong  long term relationship   or if we had poor self esteem prior to the relationship or if we had suffered other relationship or family trauma that caused us to lean heavily on the relationship for our sense of self worth       well  it is like part of identity has been ripped out   without anesthesia         So sure  many of us think  at some point in our lives  infidelity isn't such a big deal   But it can be   it can be life changing   The truth is  we are not rational  Spock like beings   We are bundles of neuroses and emotional scar tissue built on a scaffolding of cards and duct tape        Personality  chemistry  integrity  and sense of humor are the most important things for me  Virgin or not never really mattered to me  The amount of experience someone has would not effect my attraction to that person  So I don't care a bit because open communication about sex makes for good sex almost no matter what  so experience is moot  It's a toss up but I lean experienced  The suggestions and advice found from many online sources can also be beneficial in seeking out the braces treatment in

to know that THATS OK   You're here asking for advise though  so I'm going to give it my best shot   I would talk to him  Explain that you're unsure about everything and how you feel  I would suggest that you say that you don't want him to force a romantic relationship with you if he doesn't want one because of this  you don't want that either  You want someone who wants to be with you  not has to be because of a baby   But you would prefer to not make this decision alone  And then make your decision and work together to do what's best for everyone involved   Overall I think you're right in not trying to pressure him  but you also know that not only do you need him to make the decisions with you but he needs to know   Good luck and I hope everything works out for you  Awwww  Thank you so

simply to improve facial structure Just a few days ago I posted here about an affair I had with my sister in law  so I'm gonna share what I took away from my experience    Things were a bit different for me  I was going through some things that required professional help  instead I chose to confide in my brother's wife  Get too close to someone emotionally and what'll happen  Yeah  we fucked up and for an entire week and had a secret relationship right in front of my brother  Our discretion wasn't enough though  we got caught red handed    Let me start by saying you may love each other as humans  but romantically  Let's just be honest  Alcohol played a factor in my decision to take things to a sexual level  believing that we had extraordinary feelings for each other  No  we didn't  We were just two idiots who were bored and feeling unwanted making awful decisions   She has two kids herself  and not once did I ever want to replace my brother as their parental figure  Is that what you want  to be the Mom of your sister's kids  To assume the responsibility of parent  Or is it just your brother in law reminds you of your youth  of better times   While you're together alone it may be easy to escape the confines of reality  Be warned though  this is more mirage than anything  They made vows to each other  and they had children together  His care is not yours to have  and yours isn't his    Just think about your niece and nephews  Do you ever want to see them again  I don't think I'll see my niece or nephew ever again  trust me it's not worth it for a bit of puppy love   I used to have a brother who I loved  and he loved me  We could share just about anything with each other  much like you and your sister  Not even thinking about the kids yet  is it worth losing this trust  Comradery like that found between siblings is generally unreplicable  Don't throw it away thinking what if  because even if you could be together is that what you actually want  I know I only sought to feel wanted  but I should have known there're better ways to get that feeling Yep  I've written about this before  The constant feeling is that there's a club that everyone's a member of  but you're not  and you can't join  and everyone else has been super nice letting you look around  but if you dare to try and do any of those "members only" things  they're not going to like it Well if he has done that then I'd be sending the messages without a second thought Being awkward is bad  but being short or being ugly will make you more likely to be awkward  so    No  you're probably right  Life is super tough for attractive men  They really have it hard  I'm so sad for them Are you The new Angryman  I haven't been here in awhile  I would kill to be an attractive man  too Yeah  I've been thinking about this lately  too  Giving and taking advice is a really complicated thing  On the one hand  you have to be critical about where the advice is coming from  What biases does this person hold  Are they ideologically motivated  What assumptions is this person making  What are they basing their advice on   When I was depressed  I sought out help from online forums  I got a lot of folks using a religious framework to 'help' me  and sending me resources about their religion  I knew religion wasn't going to  address  my problem  and that these people were more keen on converting me than helping me overcome my problems for myself   At the same time  you also have to be conscious of your own biases and assumptions  "Am I being honest with myself "  "Why do I think the way I do " "How have I come to my own conclusions or views " "Do I hold any thoughts or emotions that are contributing to or causing my displeasure " Things like that   You really need that sense of self awareness and strength to think for yourself  When you are in a tough and trying situation    like being FA for example    it can cause hurt and vulnerability  And it's that hurt and vulnerability that people can exploit to 'win you over ' or for yourself to find comfort in ideas that cover up validate your hurt and vulnerabilities Maybe you should consider a sex change  If things are so great for women  it won't matter that you're transgendered and not passing very well Copy and paste the link  That what I usually do on mobile  ARGH  this angers me  people trying to look cool and get social brownie points doing dumb shit like this  good that you blocked them  they are not worth your damn time   Nope  The new Angryman was sending me PMs telling me to kill myself tho after posting pics of myself33 in 6 months       lol Conversely  would you really want to be with someone who would reject you over something like that  I think it's better to be honest  if they can't deal with that  then move on Hmm he sent me pics of himself right before he got his account suspended  That guy is delusional  If you're talking about UofT  academic misconduct is taken seriously and especially for undergraduates  There's not really much you can do but own up to it  I would seek the help of a professional  A therapist or councillor will help you more than Reddit will  It'll also be a safe person you can be truthful with  It's good that you are conscious of your attraction to children and the consequences  and are looking for help to make sure you do not hurt anyone  I know it doesn't mean much coming from a random person on the internet  but I'm proud of you  A lot of people make excuses for themselves   Second  remove yourself from any situations where you may come into contact with children  I'm not saying that if you have access to one you will for  sure  be a threat  but for the safety of everyone involved  I'd try to avoid having any contact with them  Tell people you hate kids and despise being around them  Do not play with children  Doing this will help keep children away from you    I think there are some support groups for those who are similar to you  have the attraction but do not want to act on it   But there will always be the 'creepier' ones who  do  make excuses  'age of consent should be lower'  ' cp should be legal'  and if the group seems to have a toxic vibe  leave    Lastly  live your life the fullest  Surround yourself with friends and family  Take up hobbies  You can be perfectly happy without ever giving in to your 'preference'    Good luck  mate    Edit  removed a sentence that conflicted with the mod post Wow The actual banana  just the peel  or all intact Nothing you can really do  When I was a freshman in college  my whole fraternity did this  Those of us that threw up before finishing ended up being the lucky ones  All of us spent the next day or two within a stones throw of a toilet because of massive  Unpredictable diarrhea  My best friend finished the challenge successfully  for close to a decade after he was lactose intolerant   one glass of milk  too much cheese  etc  gave him terrible gas and explosive shits  Well  part of being an adult is that we can tolerate and handle rejection more as part of life   Life experience is what matures us and as adults we've all been hurt and or rejected by others  it's just something that life teaches us   I don't think it's healthy for anyone to maintain and remain childlike when it comes to certain aspects of life  we have to accept that part of being an adult is that we have to accept that pain is part of life   When we reject that pain is a part of life  we may cling to remaining like children and then we become two people  child and adult  who are conflicted with one another     I highly recommend that you research some 'Coming of Age Ceremonies' and begin to accept yourself as an adult thereafter   Leave your childish ways behind and embrace being an adult   You cannot be a child and an adult simultaneously Thanks for the tip  I just tried and it actually works  But still have to type the title and type for the category  Surely Reddit app could be better Yeah  honestly  lately I've just been frustrated because I feel like there's nothing wrong with me  but all these people giving advice are like "oh  you can't even consider being in a relationship until you've got all this shit figured out " And to me that just seems really unrealistic  I mean  everyone has insecurities  even people in strong  healthy relationships  and I don't think any reasonable person ought to be saying "oh that guy's a 35 year old virgin  but he shouldn't feel any shame about that " Yet so many  unreasonable  people are out there saying that if you feel shame or have insecurities  you can't be in a relationship because you'll poison it    I'm tired of this shit  I need some woman to give me a shot and pull me kicking and screaming through the first phases of a relationship  and then maybe I'll get more comfortable and can feel a bit better about this stuff  I'm tired of this "everyone moves at their own pace" bullshit  though  The ship has sailed  If I had had sex and gotten someone pregnant at the age when the average male has sex for the first time  I'd have a kid old enough to have had sex by now at the average age  Don't tell me it's just fine and that I wasn't ready yet  That's bullshit As someone who smokes pot  I am going to try to look at both sides of the situation  Since pot is legal in CA  I assume he is getting it through legal manor  in which there would be could be no reason to get anyone involved  But  there is definitely a line that can be crossed  especially since the smell can be a bit strong scented    I say work out an agreement with them  Maybe  for each month they keep that smoke outside  it's another week  or month if you're feeling generous  they get to stay AFTER you turn 18  Tell them that if they don't cut that shit out  they're gonna be gone the day of your 18th  So  if they manage to keep it outside for ten months  maybe they get  3 months to get their shit together before you kick them out   And find out if they are spending your money  That money  from the details you've given  seems to be legally YOUR MONEY  Document every dime they purchased and continue to purchase from here on out  Make them pay it all back  and if they choose not to  that's when you press charges Weren't you the one who said you'd kill to be a woman right now Maybe seek help  Therapist I just don't see how this could be real  pretty much all of these guys are male models  yet alot of the women say they don't find them attractive  Standards are just so fucking high these days    I look like a fucking subhuman creature compared to all of them  For what it's worth  I'm sorry for your loss      They have therapist for people who recently had some one pass  It's not scary as people make it out to be  I promise It's very bad for health  though  Just like 5  hours of body training per week  I guess it is better to live short and fuck than to live long aloone though  Unfortunately my health is already very weak  I'm trying to improve my strength as I can  but I have to do knees down pushups  my wrist and back hurt otherwiseWait so you're 17 and he's atleast 19  that could end up being odd  Also  nothing wrong with not wanting to date special people if you just can't connect with them If you want to have big muscles  you should totally start lifting  If you want to meet women and have them fall in love with you  it's not going to solve all of your problems  no I feel like we're on a second date with her Tinder is great if you like to be rejected by 100 people each day for over a year I would first off talk to the teacher  I've been vocal with most of my group mates throughout high school  and always reminded them to "Get their shit together" and pestered them to do their work   I hate the expectations of men and what they must be to be attractive to women  It's too fucking much   You know that women say the same thing with the genders reversed  right One of the biggest reasons why people sometimes avoid getting braces is because they are utterly terrified of how they will look once the braces are on them It's not that easyYea  The flight attendant was pressuring me to get out of the bathroom  and I'm like "Dude  my fucking pants are around my ankles and I'm wiping my ass right now"  Then she wanted to inspect the bathroom  and on a scale of 1 10 this was probably a 7 level heater  Not a fun part of her job  I'm sure  Don't be hard on yourself  I'm sure he would know all this even without you voicing out  And all this memories maybe painful sometimes

cared enough about an anonymous strangers opinion to read what they had to say  and recognize they are a brilliant writer whose opinions are respectable and solid   Well written  friend  Fuck this bull shit  indeed Some do  some don't  You'll never know what it's like to be a woman  and it doesn't really matter since you're not a woman anyway  I can see that you're an "angry misogynist and unashamed of it " but you must know that it's not helping you  And I'm not saying "that's not helping you get a woman to like you " It's not helping you with anything  It's certainly not helping you to get any sympathy  It makes everyone here look bad when people come in with the attitude that all women have it easy  It makes it easier for people to marginalize us and act like we're all misogynists who deserve what we get  So thanks for that  And what do you get out of it  The satisfaction of feeling like you're right and everyone else is brainwashed  I'll bet that's pretty great  Maybe better than sex If I need to stop doing that to succeed  I   gladly   will  It's very hard sometimes lol no one judges people properly based on pictures  if any one of these guys were talking to these girls irl  the girls would be shaking and stuttering Call local animal control ASPCA Humane Society  They will take the dog away and provide vet care and rehoming services if your dog is

say almost all girls I see a picture of I can tell if I find them attractive or not  I don't necessarily disagree that the results probably would be different in real life though  that's the worketiquette  but that's also the reality  50  of people in a relationship cheat on their partner  and most of the affairs happen with someone from the office  because that's the people you spend the most time with and form emotional bonds  work together  fight  hate  love  and have time to develop fantasies on  you have the change to see them everyday but also to miss them when they are sick at home and during the holidaysI've went to english lanugage aperitifs  but men see other men as an annoyance between them and girls  and girls all flock together towards the few extroverted chatty disrespectful or hot guys   and yes  dancing is a seduction ritual  so most of them will act flirty and enjoy the attention and then go home and masturbate  LOL  CCCConsultants in Ophthalmic   Facial

wouldn't worry too much about it When talking  you are meant to pay attention to the person listening so you can change topic or reiterate based on their reactions Bruce Dickinson of Iron Maiden      https   en m wikipedia org wiki Bruce Dickinson   Watch this video of a patient who is sharing his review about the treatment provided to him by paras hospital Darbhanga First  congrats on this big move  I wish you all the best   deciding to pursue such care certainly isn't easy  but can be very rewarding  I used to assist patients with finding doctors so I know it can be daunting  Your regular GP should know how to assist  If they don't have a specific doctor or therapist in mind  hopefully they can guide you from there  Your insurance company may also have resources online in regards to providers within your network   Speaking of insurance  in my experience  finding a psychiatrist or therapist that's "in network" can be tricky  Before seeing any doctor  I always give my insurance company and the doctor's office a ring just to make 100  sure they accept my insurance as "in network"  Your insurance company should also be able to provide information about your plan  which you mentioned could be a PPO  and exactly what costs and services it covers   Again  wishing you all the best Got any examples    It's normal to talk about yourself  Especially since that's how you connect with a person i e  "I went to the greatest Asian restaurant last night with my family "    "Hey  I love Asian food too  I actually went to this awesome place a few weeks ago  the food was amazing  "  Now you know that you both have something common  and voila  you have a foundation to build your conversation on    I guess the best tip I can give is to straight up ask the person more questions  Especially since it's the start of the year  feel free to ask "What'd you do over the break "  "Did you go anywhere exciting "  "How'd you celebrate New Years "  but to keep the conversation flowing  interject your own experiences and opinions so that you're not interrogating the person  They will do nothing If you dont have any proof  Dont worry  He will eventually get banned   Saved  is now my phone's lock screen    Sometimes I forget  What are you talking about right now   Kicked out of a group of people you know irl or an online group Are you looking for best and

psychology building where there are more women and just wander around the hallways  Find a girl and ask hey do you want to grab lunch  She says no then say okay when are you free  can I get your number  Do this may be 10 or 15 times with women who look like you would like to date OR be friends with  The friends part is important because you can ask them to set you up on a date later or for networking for jobs  Also go to the library and sit next to a girl and ask what are you studying   What's your major  Tell her your major and continue the conversation  Then ask if they want to exchange numbers  I wouldn't  This is fueld by annoyance and hurt feelings  This will be a small blimp on your radar with a little passing time   Oh my god  Very  very few reddit posts have ever left me in tears like this  I'm honestly shaking at just the thought of everything I just said  I'm so  so sorry  I can't even think of what to say  I can only hope the best for you  But from the bottom of my heart  I do  I can't stand seeing genuine people like you in such horrible situations Not creepy  but weird  She probably just wants you to stop talking to her  It sucks for sure  but you've probably made it into a bigger deal in your head than it really is  ya know  Most of them yes  I have crappy ones facing and not facing the camera But I've never experienced worrying and thought racing of this magnitude it really just came out of nowhere  That's why I'm adamant that it might be something physical  I don't want to live through having anxiety and depression smh    all the time  Sometimes I get stuck in the middle of my sentence and try to find a workaround word that can't really replace the word I need  and so it comes out really cringey  I try to study more vocabulary You just talk about their shoes or dog  Include a picture of whatever there is in your apartment to control the heating  If you can't find anything  post a picture of the vent or radiator that the heat is coming from Me tooDoes it even fit properlySo true  I've had like three one night stands with tinder in my home country but when I'm on holiday in Italy not even one match  not even uglies   Jokes aside  I'm sure you've just had decent and not decent photos  like I have one picture that I really like of me  my head is tilted just right  I have a wonderful grin  and I don't look fat  and the light caught my eyes so wonderfully I look amazing   But I also have my passport photo where I look like I just got done strangling a family and lighting their dog on fire    So it goes both ways    I don't think I look good in person either  if that's a factor you want to consider    As far as I can tell  there's good photos and bad photos  and they don't necessarily reflect how you look in person  I agree with you  English is not my first language and I fear it gets me downvoted when I can't express something well  It does not  But that's okay  I've never had nice things  why start now Go out  Get your ass to the club  start talking to as many women as you can  Buy them drinks  dance with them   r beermoney tooDo you have a relationship with your parents where you can talk to them about things in general  If so  yes bring up how you feel  Don't worry about alarming them  You are their child and they will definitely want what's best for you    And try not to overthink things  Sometimes simple anxiety can cause us to feel things and do things that we normally wouldn't  Whatever is going on with you is not the end of the world and you will get through it  Keep your head up meditate  it helped me with talking to most people but especially strangers  It teaches you how to calm yourself down which makes it easier to think of something to say Well  she found it weird  This surprises a lot of people but the brain fog is a real physical side effect of depression and anxiety  I think it's completely unfair for you to tell this internet stranger  who is clearly still affected by traumatic events from her childhood  that she is 'ok'  How can you claim to know anything about what she has gone through and felt because of one internet post  Even if she wasn't physically touched by her brother she was harassed and made to feel uncomfortable and unsafe in her own home by  as you said  someone she should be able to trust  Nothing about that is 'lucky'  How dare you FeelsBetterManPush on through  A lot of people are in the same boat   I don't even get matches with a hot fake account  I get some bots  and some american  usually very very fat  female soldiers because there is an american base  Oh and that nice person who set up 2 accounts  or 2 friends  who tried to get me to set up a date with them both at the same time just to pull my leg  Such nice people    Even okcupid is a desert where even hot and rich don't get answers  lol    Hi  do you ever use those shoes to masturbate men     Yes indeed     Can I try     Of course    Jokes aside  I don't see what you could say about their shoes nor how you could transitino to something else  Can you write a dialogue But you're glad she's happy right  I mean she deserves to love who she wants as much as you right  You'll find somebody for you someday  But not if you let go I have heard that alot  but I think  without showing pictures of myself  I ACTUALLY have a really polarized look  I am a an Asian guy with a slightly bigger nose  and one of my eye has a lighter double eyelid so it looks smaller than the other when I'm looking at a normal angle  when im looking down     so If I pick just the right angle for my eyes to look into the camera and do an extreme rapper cocky teeth showing expression my nose looks really flat  although it's slightly bigger than average but it is generally pointy enough to look normal   I can really look like a monster   but then I have been told I have a sweet smile  and that's when I'm posing with a normal facial expression   My fear is that I am actually ALWAYS as ugly as when in my weird facial expression  I just don't notice it    What I HOPE is that the reality is the opposite  is that Im normal looking and the weird facial expression i do brings out the worst of anybody it took alot of innovation  saran wrap  and hand lotion If he's a single guy then no Did you tell them it's unsafe  I know when I got mine I had to bring in my actual card  May differ from state to state Idk no man  In the Netherlands I get plenty of matches but most of em are too young for me  You could rewrite it to be in 16 9 format As a longtime knowing and willing participant in this sideshow   the pursuit of empty aesthetics and ceremonious placeholders for emotional depth   I'm rightly ashamed at how readily my blood quivers as I read this piece   It's all true  though  We're strange in that we demand something perfect and passionate  but we tend to shrug off the ones who are most eager to be that for us  It's beneath us to give them the chance  or at least to not eventually rescind it  I think we unconsciously get it in our heads that it's unambitious to be satisfied with a lover who's not subtle about their feelings  as if they must be pitiful and desperate to have to say it aloud  Couldn't possibly be just an innocent consequence of those butterflies   We'd much rather keep reaching for what we  know  is out of reach  because then at least we get to keep our tenuous hold on the belief that we're exercising our humanity  If we die trying  that just means we never stopped loving to the fullest  et cetera et cetera   Our sense of passion has not evolved with us  You know that when you realize that there's a strong sense in which it seeks to destroy us how old are you and how old are they    if you do holidays here we could at least hang out  PWell first think you really need to concentrate on your addiction  I've seen what that can do to people  but I think you know that so no need to hammer that  As for your mom I would say go one of two routes or both  first being have her sit in with your therapist or whoever you're seeing and have him explain things to her  Option two wait it out  One of the most frustraiting things with mental illness is that time sometimes does alot of healling but its hard to see it happen  And as for your mom it might take a while for her to get older and mature to realize just how much her behavour effected you and your sister   At the same time you might want to move out when you can  if you're going to college thats good but if not than you should try and maybe find some sort of community living or a roomate whos a good influence because you dont need to let your addiction control you  One thing thats important to know is that envermental factors such as your mother have a strong effect on how bad your symtoms become  like a dimmer swich the more you turn it the brighter the light same thing applies to stress factors  But as for "getting over it" and shit like that dont listen you can help urself but thats only when others can help give you power  and sometimes meds  You have a limited control of this and you cant force yourself to stop feeling depressed no matter who you are   Also if you every find that you're mom or anyone you're talking to about this is giving you advice using their experiance stop them and just try and tell them you just need someone to listen to you cause doing that can actually hurt just as much as them not being there  Lastly  sorry for the long rant  but try and change your thinking  such as if you're ever harsh on yourself start talking to yourself like you would someone else  Would you tell them all the hurtful things you tell yourself  Its also ok to help yourself and be there for you  idk if that makes sense but I visualize me consoling my younger self and just being there  and tell myself its ok to grieve over whatever is hurting me and just trying to help me  Little things like that can make a big difference  but most importantly many people suffer from mental illness so you are not alone  and whenever it gets bad try and keep fighting  it may be bad sometimes  but if you keep going and seeking help you will win  you just need to keep trying to help you and if you dont believe me I understand but you just gotta keep going and one day you'll wake up and things will be a bit clearer  Hope that helps a bit  bit of a read lol  if you have any more questions or need to talk just reply and hopefully it wont be as long eh  its okay  it was a long time ago  and i was wayyy luckier than i should have been   i didnt go down dirt roads for yearss after that   lol  i hope youre feeling okay todayNot particularly creepy  but definitely comes off as a bit desperate and lacks in confidence  It's something I struggle with too  but build up your confidence and self esteem and you might have better luck You can't have a relationship with your brother in law  not unless you're willing to lose your whole family  There is no way you can ever be with him and still have a relationship with your parents  your sister  your nieces or nephews  They would not accept it    This relationship is not in your best interest  It holds only pain for you  and for everyone you love  Let it go and move on  It's hard but you can do it  I was just curious if you found a way to size it that's all  Sorry about your shit luckYour best bet is to do as much of the assignment as you're able  Half assing the assignment and getting a 50  is better than a 0  from not turning in anything   If you have good reason for not being able to complete it over the holidays  e g  you where out of the country the entire time and didn't have access to the materials you needed   you can attempt to talk to your teacher and get an extension of some sort   but even then  having something to turn in for the likely event that your request for extension will be denied is still a good idea   All you can do from there is try to make up for it by pushing your average up through good marks on future assignments or maybe your inner self is a chad and you neg the nurse who proceeds to have sex with you as you die from all the jumping over your open heart  dead  but not still a slayerHonestly that sounds really unhealthy to talk to her  You have set up SO many expectations when in reality you have no idea what she is like  I gurantee you she is not like the person youve made up in your head  I don't think any kind of relationship with someone you obsessed over so much without knowing them is possible I would say talk to your godparents  explain to them what's happening and that you need help  They might be able to a  move in with you or b  help with telling your guardian to stop being a jackass with your inheritance    As guardian  spending the estate money  does he not have to produce evidence of where that money is going to  I imagine it'd be worthwhile talking to a lawyer about how to follow up on where the funds are being spent  Its also worth looking at   preparing yourself on how to lock his access out when you turn 18 so that he doesn't spite spend IM PERFECTLY FINE WITH MY LIFE THAT'S WHY I WANT TO TAKE THE BURDEN AND PAINS OF A COMPLICATED RELATIONSHIP WITH ANOTHER HUMAN AND INVEST TONS OF TIME MONEY AND EMOTIONAL ENERGIES   BECAUSE IM PERFECTLY CONTENT AND HAPPY WITH MY LIFE         facepalm   they don't get it man  they don't get it what clubs are you talking of  like dance clubs or book clubs It's easy  Women love it when someone talks about their shoes  Like you could do the obvious and ask about her tattoo or her nice eye color but literally every guy she has come across already did that  She's tired of it  But because women spend so much time choosing  buying and matching their shoes  whenever someone asks about them they feel wonderful  Like you say  "Hey I really like your shoes  Where did you get them  they look expensive"  She'll be like  thank you  I got them from X and actually they're not that expensive  then you say but they look so nice especially with your outfit  After doing that for awhile you're set  After this she knows you as the guy that complemented her shoes  This is what's in her head for the rest of the day  It's like when someone complements your Biceps or something  So now you can pretty much say whatever you want and she'll nod along and laugh extra hard at your jokes  Then ask if she would like to get coffee or some shit  Get her number and you're in baby  Obviously it's best to do this at a party or bar or something but mall could work too  what kind of club Unless you have a below average size penis  it wont matter  What will  is your confidence and how you use it   She wont get out a measuring tape and go "well  SHE was lying " then proceed to get up and walk away  Remind him that passports can take up to 6 weeks to process  so if you don't do it   NOW    there's a chance you won't get it in time   Find a time when there's nothing going on  maybe right after dinner   put the forms in front of him  and hand him a pen    If he's the forgetful type  don't give him a vague "remember to do this sometime"  Give him a fixed time  A fixed place  And the easiest of those to remember are "now"  and "here" Get a fleshlight men are the diceroll of nature  the experiments  the fodder cannon Yeah sorry but I don't think I'm looking to hang out with anyone here  I'm just visiting my family  SorryI can relate to this very much  I had extremely strict parents who pushed me to get better grades all the time  When I was in middle school it wasn't so bad  but after several moves and about 6 different schools I ended up going from an average USA school  where I was top of my class  to a very high standard AUS school where the kids were best in state in science and maths  I just couldn't compete and found the work so hard my grades started slipping  This caused countless awful screaming matches between my parents and I about why I wasn't motivated    I graduated university two years ago now  but my high school memories in particular were awful to me  I would love to have faked it til I made it  or just kept trying  But I was honestly so depressed I wanted to kill myself at the time    My honest advice is seek some counsel from someone at your school  like a trusted teacher or school counselor  Counselors see this sort of thing ALL the time and should be able to offer guidance   You shouldn't need your parents permission to do this  If you're more confident  consider inviting your parents to a group counseling session so you can release all your thoughts to a third party  This will allow for you to discuss your grievances without blowing up in each other's faces    The strain caused by my grades caused irreparable damage to my relationship to my parents even to this day  seven years after finishing high school  I do wish I had done something at the time   best of luck to you  I know exactly how it feels   girls tell each other "ew" when they are together looking at a hot guy in front of a camera or other men and then go home to rub one out in shame  Amazing  You have so much self worth and are mentally strong enough to take care of YOU  You saw him for what he was was  he was gonna keep cheating after you took him back  Fool me once kinda thing  Most would just let it happen over and over and think they aren't able to make it without their husband or partner  You aren't a fool  he is and has lost someone he will never have again  His life is changed and things won't come easy to him in the process of starting over  He chose this and after that  you chose you  That's strength  I wish you the best in your future  Is sad but sometimes the family isnt a group of people who loves each others   The best you can do is  from my non proffesional viewpoint  at first  help your mum and try to take her out of the suicidal mood at least  If she keeps in that way and refuses to seek help out of the family the problem is more likely to never dissappear  She is taking the worst part and really needs someone else   Then comes your sister  Its pretty obvious that she is not fully aware about her behaviour but she wont admit or recognize  so don't start by there  Just keep in contact with her and try to make her realize about other things why she needs your family and why your family needs her  Try to get your dad involved but just dont let her go out of the family because of this   If nothing of this works    family is important but You are the only one who is going to live your life so think for yourself and keep on with your life  Try to make your best at college and become a person you can be proud of   I wish you good luck  If you can keep us updated about the situation I think we could help a bit more So   you need to be so attractive on the outside that just saying gibbersih will make her want you  Ok  got it We'd still be loser shut ins even if we didn't complain here  so we might as well complain You play the hand that life dealt you   If romance is not in the cards  move on   There are other challenges in life Hey good going man  I hope I personally take the leap before I'm 32 I started to harm myself in safer ways  like getting a piece of ice and holding it in your hand or an elastic band on your wrist  The elastic band worked really well for me because I could do it any where at any time    Edit  eventually I stopped  but it's hard to just stop  that's why I would suggest using the safer ways of self harm  until things get better I agree   How good are you going to feel about yourself if you prolong a relationship by making yourself out to be something you're not   Better to have the courage to be yourself  get rejected and take that experience and use it to find someone who will like you for yourself no your supposed to work your ass of to find something you actually like  I tried bowling  running  basketball  tennis  yoga  spin classes  sno boarding  boardgames  private pilot license classes  guitar  lifting  crossfit and a few more I probably forgot    Think I even started being a videographer for a few weddings    I'm not sayign you have to try the things I did  but if you never do anything new then you never grow as a person  Read 3  man Corey Wayne turner and you'll understand why to never do that again Take it with you  just in case   If you are having to look for reasons to be mad  then don't be mad Congrats man   looks like this year is looking up for you Kahn academy would probably be the easiest resource to use  explains how to do everything very simply  You could probably also do a course on udacity with anything to do with data science if you expect to work with big data some day   Pretty much I found most maths things that came up at uni could usually be easily understood just googling it though or finding a tutorial on youtube 0 to 1 I'll take it r meirlRegardless of whether or not she's doing it for attention  she thinks she is and is reaching out to people who are meant to help her  They've failed  Luckily  you're there to help   I would take her to a Paediatrician  explain the situation to them  Try and find one in your local area that specialises or has experience with depression  I only say this because after some experiences  not all of the doctors out there know WTF they're doing when it comes to depression   Visited Dr A  explained what was happening  He said that  person  was depressed because of all the electronics that are around today  with no regard to what was said at all  Dr B  said that  person  wasn't depressed because the symptoms weren't severe enough  but they're going that way and offered no follow up or recourse on how to avoid it happening  It did    So make sure they know what they're doing   Other than that  I'd recommend reassuring her that you're a l w a y s there to talk to  Talk to her and see if she can explain to you why she's feeling the way she's feeling and work together to combat them    Good luck  you sound like an awesome big sibling Give her the best last moments of her life  Don't think about losing her  think about how happy you are that she's been in your life  Death is a part of life and it's scary but know it won't be painful for her to be put down and she loves you  Make sure you spend as much time as you can with her   P s is she actually sick  Or you are just worried cuz she's old Ah  Hollywood education at its best    I assure you  alcohol poisoning is an actual thing and not some manly rite of passing       I feel for your liver and hope it will find a better person after you drink yourself into your grave in a misguided attempt to be cool That sucks  I've personally been in positions like this   specifically when someone nearly brand new was promoted into a position others were hoping I might get when I had been there a year  longer  If it helps  that happened to me two years ago and now I couldn't give a stuff  that person has since quit and I worked hard and got an absolutely stellar promotion  ie  from store manager to head office    In times like this I just think   remember JK rowling was rejected 12 times before being considered for publishing  Your time will come  this just isn't it  Fuck that The best thing you can do is seek professional help from a therapist She's ok I'm just worried because she's getting old   i love her so much Thanks  I'm trying  but it's hard  Writing this post might actually have made it worse  but I'll try to keep my head straight Thanks all for the encouraging comments     It hasn't been easy after all    I spent Christmas and New Year's with people I love  but when I return home at night    I would miss him till I heave with all the tears pouring down my face   The first time he cheated  I asked "what I did I do to make the marriage suck enough for you to look outwards "  This time  it's all on him  He will bear the weight of the shambles of our marriage   This time round  I saw him for what he is  and I saw my own worth for what I am  And I am not giving him another chance to make me feel otherwise again  i dont see anything fun about that if i need to work 40 hours im mad for 40 hours because i really really dont want to do all that bullshit because i need money   Work can be or can not be fun     but that is besides the point   People go to work because they want to stay housed  and they want to eat   Plus buy things     It is something that nearly everyone does   Even if they hate their actual job  not just the concept of working   If you don't want to work  quit working for a while and see how that goes  and how much fun it is   Maybe your parents will let you move back in  and you can go and avoid work from their house   Unless you can find someone else willing to support your   I've always told my kids that it is a great privilege to work   It means you have your health  and that you have the ability to make your way out of a worser situation   There are people who are born poor  and live in areas that don't offer public transportation  and they are trapped in that no work poverty   They don't have the good luck of being able to work  they are trapped in that poverty   Myself  I have always loved working   It was where I got to talk to grown ups at   I would get a break from the kids  they would get a break from me  and I could converse with great minds   Or sometimes little minds   But I have always loved working   I'd be happy to see people  they'd be happy to see me     just loved it       Perhaps change the hours that you work  or the kind of job you do  or people you are around   Work isn't so much a place that should be fun  but a place you can shine in your chosen profession   Then you get a sense of pride from that "You're not entitled to a relationship" "Don't try to be content without one tho"Honestly just ask her if she wants to go on a date  no one can do anything beyond telling you to do that  Stuff isn't going to magically start unless you start it  most girls like 90  of the time will NOT ask you as the guy you have to ask them  Well  you only need one  you know     so there are more than enough left  and I would rather date a woman  thats ok with it  than one that is not     It's just that everything I'm into has the lowest female percentage ever  So my search wouldn't be "what I like" but "what thing I can do that has a normal female participation that doesn't make me feel completely uncomfortable and that I can fake interest in  and doesn't cost too much  and offers good opportunities to talk to people"Thanks for this    Great words   Congrats  Yeah  it's a hell of a feeling to have gotten past that initial step It's gibberish in the sense that it doesn't communicate anything to her  You are not telling her anything about yourself  You are not asking anything about herself  You are doing the equivalent of when a girl asks you to "go upstairs with her to get coffee"  Filling sentences with an excuse that she finds socially acceptable to interact with her  and she gets attracted to you just by looking at you  Girls however flee for emergency exits when they see me  so as much as I hate small talk I could try it  but it would have no purpose in my case since they see me as non male subhuman guy that can fix your computer guyPerhaps he just needed a break from you Hey man  I've never been in your situation but here's my two cents  I think you should give the girl some space and let her deal with her boyfriend  It's not your fault that she fucked up  If she breaks up with her boyfriend them hey you got yourself a girl but  if she goes behind his back  she'll go behind yours too  Just give it time and think about it dude  don't so anything rash  Good luck When my mother was taken to hospital  literally a 2 min drive   she was given a  600 bill for the trip  So the amount isn't really that shocking   While you were in hospital  you were given an IV  you were spoken to by a Nurse and had a consultation with a doctor  I don't see why you shouldn't pay  sorry   You could look up on the hospital website  see if there is any information on there about refuting the bill  Keep it up  Yeah  and logically I know that  But the  emotional   part of me just doesn't want to agree and I can't make it shut up  I just don't know how else to get over it  ya know  It's more of a I have nothing to lose kind of situation  And I know there's a  0000001  of anything good coming from it  but again that emotional part just clings to that  000001  and wants to make the best of it  I just don't know how to do that You wear meme shirts    Disgusting Well if she's not sick  she probably has time left  Like I said  make sure she enjoys her last years of life  Spend enough time with her so you don't regret anything later  I've preached that same attitude when I've been in the trenches  If I had any idea what pulled me back up on my feet  I'd offer it up straight away  but my attitude eventually shifted to something more akin to "fuck what you people have to say about life  I'm not done trolling the fuck out of this planet yet " And that  still  pulls me though some of the worse  after I've had time to lose  find  and re attach my head    usually in that order   This life sucks when you're depressed  This life isn't worth it when you're depressed  Tomorrow is a struggle best slept away when you're depressed  These are things I get  But by the same token  there's precious little stopping you from trying to make another  better life in the meantime  There are certainly obstacles to starting a  particular  life  maybe   one can't always look forward to being wealthy  or suddenly surrounded by throngs of the opposite sex  or a world champion of samurai fencing  you know somewhere out there  somebody pines for that    but if you can suspend getting hung up on anything too material or otherwise just laid up in contingencies like that  you at least have the freedom to go searching for better   I know that's weak on the heels of not even knowing exactly what to suggest as far as what "better" might look like for you  but that's part of the point  too  Letting that search keep you busy while you find it is a reason to stay alive  You have to be able to contrive a little bit of enthusiasm for it  but this can't be  that  hard  People like you and me have managed to do it for  years  at a time  What's one more   Seriously  fuck this planet  What could  possibly  be more important than you getting happy right now  Troll those fuckers  troll 'em hard  Go do you and trample all over anybody who wants to mess with that   It's your turn  Go own this year Not really 'pop' but there are many euro symphonic metal bands with classically trained   opera singers   A lot of it is more 'soundtrack y' or musical theatre esq than classical  but there are also artists who are very classically inspired  yngwie malmsteen comes to mind    Some examples of good bands that they may connect with are      Nightwish   Ghost Love Score  http   www youtube com watch v 9bLnMSzFeyA list

Rhapsody   Dawn of Victory  https   youtu be 0L iOnLNt9M   this is a little on the slightly heavier side and very fantasy inspired  Rhapsody are an Italian symphonic metal band that create incredibly intricate rock opera opus' which captured the imagination of the late Christopher Lee  who guested on several albums from memory as a narrator  This lead to Lee branching off and creating his own metal album    That's the best examples I can think of for now  Many of these artists have fans that I think like the fact that the music is in some way 'classically inspired' however I'm not sure how well it would track with a classical purist    Be interested to find out  I think 13 years is enough  I wake up miserable and I go to sleep miserable  History tells us your wishes won't come true  but hey it's 2017 and I'm trying to be less cynical    So   yeah  If you end up going on a date with her  and you get to the end of the date  and she doesn't leave straight away  or isn't in a hurry to get out of the car  or go into the apartment  she's likely waiting for you to kiss her  I fucked up many chances by being entirely too gentlemanly when all the signals were there  only to be told this later on  Of course you can just say you'd like to kiss her if you're not sure Dad was out of line  In your situation  I would file a formal complaint with Internal Affairs Bureau of his department   Why   Because while he can't put you in jail for being with his daughter  he can trump up other charges   Having a complaint against him could save your ass later If they're concerned about money  I would build a budget with any costs related to the dog built in to show that you can afford it  If they're concerned that you won't have time for the dog build a schedule show them when you will have time to walk the dog and all that jazz as well as take care of school stuff  Well that's why you try a bunch of stuff  You never know until you try it   Watch this video of a patient who is sharing his review about the treatment provided to him by paras hospital Darbhanga I think I know why the shower thing works it's because the shower provides warmth that we'll probably never feel from another human being I understand what you're saying  it is a mental issue  when those mental issues harm or have the potential to harm others  especially defenseless children  there is absolutely no other recourse   Period   No reasonable argument can be made otherwise I've been told that I look better IRL than in pictures by a few people  I think my strong features come off as more normal IRL than they do in a picture  I've also been told the opposite  but it was usually when I was trying to appear a lot different or better looking than I was    I've also had better luck with women IRL  so I think it might be a true  https   m youtube com watch v 7rebXQHVZ54  This might helpWell saidIt's harder to understand the full impact if you're not a woman  No one else can decide what to do with your body  Guys just have to be super vigilant with their birth control  What's the common denominator there   You're completely entitled to your own thoughts and perspective  but if the problem really reduces to the fact that you can't ever seem to feel anything above and beyond misery  then I urge you to consider a serious inquiry into why and what can be done to change that  You have so much power over your own destiny  but not if you're willingly surrendering it to the day as soon as you wake up  I know you probably don't believe that right now  but that's exactly why I'm saying it   I know this is a hard sell  I'm not going to bullshit about that  but you haven't nearly exhausted your options if you really think you're just determined by the physics of things to spend every day miserable I've tried many things already  Life just doesn't get better for everyone  Well if it makes you feel any better  if an employer ever gave me a Facebook quiz as part of my employee file  I'd be out of there so fast there would be a flurry of paper left behind from the vacuum effect believe me  anger is a gift Really  So bars  or w e you meet people  worked better than dating sites   I have been told that I have a sweet smile but ironically I think I look quite hideous when I smile  My face is most tolerable when I don't make any facial expression i hope not  i need 2 hands  Were you comfortable during the date   Pretty much  it was way worse before  But once we started talking it didn't feel uncomfortable at all  It think it might have been a combination of me beeing a pretty active listener and the fact that we were walking instead of just sitting somewhere and staring at eachother     Does it make you anxious to think that you'll have to initiate a kiss  Oh  I'm fucking terrified  Hopefully it will come somewhat natural if we get to that stage     because at this age we're expected to know how to do these things well  I think that comes down to confidence  Deep down  you most likely have a pretty basic idea of what to do in those situations  if not from experience  then from just growing up watching television  And I don't think anyone expects it to be perfect the first time  You start out at the basic level and work your way up together     it takes a lot of strength to overcome it  Indeed  So start out small  and gradually you will get stronger  At some point you'll have the guts to do what I did Oh  trust me  I won't be mentioning that unless she specifically asks me for some reason  I don't really see anything positive coming from doing that  If the topic of previous relationships comes up  I'll try to dodge the question by saying that it has been "longer than I'm comfortable to admit" since my last one getting the "ugh ew" face of disgust for a full second each time you approach a girl or woman at aperitifs has been enough for me   the "I'm gonna get something to drink" or "I'm gonna reach my friend" are not very fun   but probably the biggest stab in the heart were the men who I chatted more than once with and thought we were getting along fine who pretended not to hear me and didn't even turn their heads after I touched their arms  after them "not hearing me" as they were talking with othres  because I wanted to tell them goodbye as I was going home  kekweak  I take a shit inside a cannon and just blast it to new horizonsBash it's brains out  You get to decide whether I mean mil or dog when I say it  Why worry about seeing them around town  Why give somebody that much power over you that when you go out in public  you constantly worry about seeing them    If anything you shouldn't give a shit and if you do see them  give them a smile and let them know that you're not bothered by them at all  Even if you have to "act" like you're doing better  Better than letting them look at you and you give off the look of shame or embarrassment Yeah  I've had girls talk to me at parties etc  but when it comes to online dating I'm almost completely ignored  I'm not sure if this is due to the pictures or maybe I'm just better at interacting when I'm a bit buzzed    I think I look hideous as well when I smile  it makes all of my features stand out more  When I'm completely straight faced I look the most normal  I'm not even joking  some of us could probably act alpha or much more manly under hypnosis or dishinibition   sedatives1st I'm assuming you mean the U S  when you say "here"   If that's the case  it's completely normal to go by a alternative nickname   plenty of people go by shortened names  middle names  assumed English names  etc  And no one gives a fuck   Pick your new name that it sounds like you're already using    TL DR Do you boobooIt's easy to talk about yourself  as you are aware   Consider why you talk to friends  expressing yourself  learning new things  exchanging information  reaffirming tearing down beliefs or just having small talk  When I talk to my friends I know they feel comfortable talking to me about insecurities or beliefs  The best way I've found to create meaningful conversation is to question them about what they say  Pick apart their arguments  have them explain  ask questions   even if you know the answer   For example if a friend says 'Cows are stupid' I'll counter with 'why do you think this way '  They might respond with how a cow traumatized them as a child  So I might ask another question like 'how did a cow traumatize you ' Or 'does it make you feel better to eat steaks '  It might seem lame to only ask questions but people will open up and will genuinely enjoy talking to you    When it comes your turn to talk and express yourself the enjoyment of speaking to you doesn't just go away  It might take a few decent conversations but they will learn to listen and question you as well    Even some of my friends who very clearly enjoy talking about themselves exclusively can be lured into interesting back and forth conversations about shared interests and activities  Now all of this is anecdotal so take it with a grain of salt but it's worked for me so far  I wish you the best of luck  Thanks for the honesty replies  I have been cheated on  My point is  I have never met anyone who did not want to cheat  on top of that I have known so many people  young and old  with kids and without  married or in a long distance relationship who have had affairs  Sooner or later  your partner will get tired to have sex without  or you will tire first  My    of my chest comment    is I'm starting to believe it is universal  at some point  Thanks for the reply  will PM you did you just go full bananasIt is the most natural thing in the world for a child  even adult child of the parents  to want to love their parents   Even those that lived miserable childhoods    Parent's demand money every time they are over   Yea     I'd tell them some form of no   "Sorry  don't have it"  "Hell no   whole reason I don't go to the casino is that I can't afford to lose my money in one"  "I need to focus on my own family now"   But I'd find a polite or abrasive way to let them know that this will never happen again   If they want the same that they provided you in childhood  you will purchase for them "1 pair of shoes for church and school  2 pants and maybe 2 3 shirts that I switch on and off sometimes wearing my PE t shirt for the day "  and nothing more   And that you are willing to do this once a year for 18 years   But no more than that I don't think that's a very good test  you can't draw a conclusion   An ugly person can look good from some angles  You can take ugly pictures of anyone  even very attractive people  if you try hard enough   For some extremely ugly people it might be impossible to get a good picture  so it's save to say that you aren't extremely ugly  But you already knew that   Additionally there is one huge problem with this  You are evaluating it yourself  Humans suck at estimating their own attractiveness I can't pretend it does  I'm not trying to sell you anything  but for my own conscience I can't not try to offer something of value   I've been where you are  I was there for years  I've attempted more times than I can confidently count  and some of those attempts came with devastating consequences  I've crawled out of layers of hell I didn't know existed  It still sucks some days  I still contemplate suicide some days  But there is a way out  You  have  to give it that first push  though  and I don't know a way around that Whatever dude  Thanks for the suggestion mate but I'm not from the USA so it's a bit far  Hopefully this weekend  I'm giving it a day or two before I ask What a good comment  It is true we are not rational  Can I ask you an honest question  while I realize that you don't want to hurt anyone  most people don't  Don't you want to have sex with other people  And if not now  can't you see a point where either you or your partner will want to have sex with other people  No  and the sad reality is he probably never did  He was using you at the time  and he is probably using his current partner  It's clear from the fact he treated you poorly that he is only concerned with his own wellbeing  I apologise for the stern statement  but you need to know that he not only doesn't care  but is a pretty shitty person  You should distance yourself from him if possible If you need an ELI5  please take it to their sub   This is not it   This post has been removed This is normal and why people complain about American health care  This is also why it costs so much  the ER can't turn people away for treatment so they must treat everyone whether it's an emergency or not which significantly raises health care costs  You will likely get a separate bill from the ambulance company as well  they're usually independent from the hospital    In future if at all possible avoid ambulances  get a different ride  and limit ER trips A woman let him put his penis inside herYep  I totally agree Desperation is one of the most unattractive things you can do      Confidence is one of the most attractive things you can do     If things don't seem "natural" then it feels weird    Aww    Thanks Not if you're in shape  Tinder is all about look  People there usually just want to get laid  and  rightfully  they choose only by look  Did you kiss her  Be sure to kiss her during second date  if you wait too much you will land in the friendzone Thanks Thanks for your response    Well the thing is I'm not really crippled by anxiety or anything  I mean sometimes I get the odd bit but nowadays I am more just slightly unhappy with my position    I think it has to do with being at college  I mean I know I'm getting a solid degree that will net me a career  but it feels like a huge step back for me  I'm surrounded by 18 year old kids and I sort of feel like I don't fit in  I don't really have the time for employment to be honest  the studies are quite intensive  If they're going via college  loans   Save up money first then go   Work multiple jobs   Live with roomates or hunt for a deal on an effeciency   And a big part  when someone says they live in the city  they don't necessarily live in the actual city limits  areas where costs are highest  There's cheaper area in many cities  sometimes pretty ghetto   and sometimes cheaper places  just outside the city   I e  you can't afford Philly so you stay in Chester or Wilmington    Or for instance a lot of New Yorkers  are actually New jerseyites  Pennsylvanians  Rhode islanders  etc  Who take the train into the city for work R learnmath This thread just gets better and better  grabs popcorn It's difficult  You become addicted to it  I still consider cutting myself when I feel even slightly upset   I quit kinda cold turkey  I saw how much it was hurting my fiancé  He saw the cuts and I hated seeing him upset about it  what ethnic group do you belong to  if you don't mind me asking I think it might have been  some of these  http   www lovepanky com flirting flings dating game first date questions   A lot of them are terrible though in my oppinion  so use them more as a way to start thinking about what type of questions you would be comfortable asking  And remember to be genuinly interested in the other person and what they're saying  and then build the conversation on those answers I'm white  I have really strong eastern european features though  think  big nose  large forehead etc   Really  I'm still FA and get Instagram snapchat notifications  sometimes Facebook and Twitter if someone sends me a message  Sorry friend  it just isn't possible I guess I'm not quite as isolated as you  My parents are in my life  sort of  They live in another state and we pretty much only talk on holidays  but I think they'd still be bummed if I ate it   Also I suppose my coworkers would notice if I stopped showing up for work   In my mind there's something kind of nice in having literally no one give a shit if you exist  It seems kind of freeing Yes  but my outside is so not attractive that even dwarf girls and ugly fat girls in a wheelchair don't bother responding to me online  Not that I get many responses with chad accounts either  though Yeah while my university was a social desert for me right now i live a very rich life socially  Some pointers are    during parties spend time with people you don't know yet   when you enter a new social situation introduce yourself to everyone immediately   don't become dependant on one social circle   in fact don't depend on anyone else to do cool stuff  go to fun events alone whenever you want   branch out to friends of your friends   whenever there is music involved  dance  even ehen sober  and even if noone else is dancing   be the one from your group that approaches other people  especially hot girlsI could use some advice  badly It's not the size of the ship  but the motion of the ocean  Unless you've got a seriously undersized penis I don't think anyone will notice something is amissYou are probably too anxious  you should relax and be more interested in the conversation  You can't have nothing to say if you are genually interested in what you are talking about  Only parents  I never leave the house and never talk to anybody online Congrats  You sound very thoughtful and level headed  Keep that up  It's really all about taking that first step to leave your comfort zone  I liken it to physics all the time  Objects at rest stay at rest  and objects in motion stay in motion  If you can just find a way to get yourself moving  it becomes so much easier  I hope things go well for you I've had two girlfriends in the past couple years  so I'm not sure I'm hypersensitive to it  I mean it's possible I am as a residual effect of being FA for so many years  but I certainly don't feel like that's the case  Regardless  I still find myself rolling my eyes at shoehorning SO's into the title of their posts   I'm moving around the middle of the month so I think I'll try it once I settle in   That's exactly what I did actually  Once I got settled in my new appartment  I decided that it was time to do something about that missing part of my life     Truly  thanks for writing this  For me  the biggest part is the motivation   I'm glad I can help  Good luck What do you think it the most commonly used metric for measuring attractiveness  Your "best" pictures  combination of both of continuous observation of a person for a long time by actually interacting with this person   I have a cousin who is really good looking  and I don't know if it's because I evaluate his attraction level with a preconception that he's good looking OR it's because he's "Truly" good looking  but even in his "crappy" pictures I don't find him unattractive at all  I immediately recognize that he's just making a weird face or the picture is taken at an awkward angle   So Perhaps that's the lens I am missing when evaluating my own appearance   in general I like to first accept the fact that I am unattractive based on the "crappy" pictures I have taken  and be proven wrong by compliments of others  Seem to be a better alternative than strolling up in town thinking I'm normal   above average and have someone stumble upon my ugly moments   my biggest fear  someone  possibly someone im in romantic relationship in  one day found my ugly pictures or discover a perspective that makes me look extraordinarily ugly from how I look normally  I really don't want to be someone's rock bottom   I am also kind of chubby  I don't know if this matters but to me I've always thought your facial features are independent from your fat body ratio  mostly because I personally put a strong emphasis on facial features like your eyes  and the shape of your nose and so on  Coming from a 33 y o hoping to get out there everything will start to make more sense                                     Honeslty for me I just did the activity and waited for people to talk to me  Like when I ran marathons I would just run and wait for peopel to talk to me  it too a few years but it  happened  I was expecting it to fly away from him in disgust  Good to see it didn'tI'd recommend a journal of sorts  Next time you have an idea or belief you feel strongly about write it down  Then expand on that idea in the journal  It allows you to take your time in forming the idea by allowing your to work sentence by sentence until you've reached a point where you can articulate it into a conversation    Sometimes it takes me 30 minutes to put down a sentence that I feel best explains what I'm trying to convey  But once I've written it it just becomes a matter or recalling the sentence idea in conversation instead of trying to think of it on the spot  I hope this helps Why is opt out immoral It's unfair  some people can be so dense that money just seems like a priority over human interactions  Rather than a waste of time  this could be seen as a lesson  Not everyone deserves your kindness  but your kindness only reflects positively on your character    I say fuck that noise  live free and slightly in debtI will and always do  Thanks for making me not feel alone  I am a sucker for european features  I am often humbled by asians  men and women  with very strong european features  those people are gods and goddesses to me  same with europeans with asian features    my obsession with beauty standards has gotten to a point I have never had a girlfriend mostly due to the fact that I idolize both men and women with such god   like appearances    Well that and the fact that I have low self esteem and super ugly face At  750 I'm over halfway there  I meet with the lawyer today if I don't get called into work  If you're able to donate or even just spread the word  I'd really appreciate it  and if you go longer than a year   its probably best    like after youre engaged or something     but for real   telling her is a bad idea I prefer younger guys  They're more attractive and also I feel I have more things in common with them as my interests tend to be things younger people are into Don't pay attention to what people say they find attractive  there's an entire lifetime of external pressure mediating their response to these questions  Think over the relationships you've personally observed if you want to know what hetero women find attractive in men     Also dude please stop watching these 'we ask women X' videos  I know from a lot of personal experience that they just spur feelings of inferiority and self loathing  Maybe attractoids can gather validation from those shits but not us     BTW if you'll permit some armchair psychology there's some conscious virtue signaling even when they're asked to be upfront in their responses  The way the Japanese girl responds to the guy at 4 15 says way more about her desire to save face than her personal feelings Hang in there  Being past the 30 mark  I had pretty much given up hope of ever managing to get into a relationship with someone  But it's really never too late if he needs any help please pm meWhat a waste of money to visit a friend and have them ditch you  Sorry man  You write really well  so there's that  When you start to go too fast and try to do everything at once just stop  Sit down  take a deep  cleansing breath and be in the moment  I can't tell you what to study or do  but just remember that there's no rush  Just  be  I mean  its not too bad  I've got a free place to stay  Its just irritating  Sorry if you're not up for talkingThey asked me if i was gay couple of yrs ago and since then they just put their heads into the sand and act as if the topic of me and girls doesnt exist  But at least they arent delusional to the point where they would expect grandchildren and stuff from meI'm really sorry to hear about what you're going through and while it may sounds extreme  I think you may need to let this friendship fade away   You're probably going to object to that  but try to think about why you're objecting   Is it because you really value her as a friend and want that friendship or is it because letting her go essentially makes it definite that you'll never be with her   Unfortunately though  her being taken and moving away already makes this definite   Remember that you aren't doing yourself any favors by holding onto her and it isn't fair to her or her boyfriend either   You're holding yourself back from finding someone who's better for you   Plus  even if you're good friends  that doesn't always mean you two will be good in a relationship   I unfortunately had to learn that from experience   It's going to be hard but you need to try to move on   It's the best thing for you   Good luck and pm me if you need to talk about it more because I definitely understand how you feel I love Santo and Johnny  always liked Sleepwalk  to me it's not sad  just nostalgic  Which is different   for me  How ugly are you exactly Eyelid is a surgery that reduces or adds fat to eyelids and gives youthful appearance  http   drarturovaldez com procedures face procedures eyelid surgery   our company is the most efficient and cost effective source for providing top level eyelid surgery to improve your facial skin and ensure beautiful and natural look  The point is OP shouldn't have been drinking that much  period The above comment is perfect   The only thing to add on is that you should wonder why you deem her to be a source of happiness if  from what you wrote in the post  she's only causing you an extreme amount of pain     Well this person is away from home and living in another country  They come from a  let's say a restrictive background due to culture and religion    And it seems to be the only way I can get through to them  I previously said I would contact family and ask for my money back  But then I got the manipulative   " is that what our friendship is worth  I told you I would pay"  It sounds like you might have some leverage with her family  though it's certainly possible she can manipulate her them as well  I suppose it's just a question of whether you are prepared to go through with it  To me  it seems like you might be    It just pains me  I helped being a kind friend  probably was their best friend and it's all just fell apart to this   I understand how you feel      Well interestingly when I sat with them to go through things  I said I didn't want any drama around this  And asked what "going back to what we had" meant  I said I hope it didn't mean stick around while I don't pay you  And they told me I was over thinking things and was confused  Which made me laugh a lot  At this point I gave up and left because the conversation was going nowhere   You seem to have already figured this all out  Well done for calling her out  That being said  good luck getting her to see reason  I suspect part of the strategy she is using on you is to engage you in a never ending struggle  She went on the attack this time  and told  you  that you were confused  Sounds like it threw you off your guard a little    Bad situation really  Anyway I just hope I can get them to act and pay me back I just don't think after everything I can just disappear off and be walked all over like this  I think a lot of her close friends make her decisions for her and advise her badly   Totally  You know this situation better than I do  but I would be careful about assuming that her friends are the ones pulling the strings  People who are manipulative often believe that they are the victim of circumstance  and that everyone else is responsible but themselves  By processing things in such away as to appear helpless  they are able to seduce others into tending to their needs I can comfortably use fingers by myself but get nothing from it  so I rarely do   but just thinking about any kind of penetration with toys makes me uncomfortable   Concerning the size disparity you are probably right  I am quite petite  and he is big  but it seems to be more psychological than anything else  That was not the point of my post to which you replied   Thanks  I'm doing that now  but only for things she didn't leave me out of on purpose otherwise I just say okay or sure and nothing else  I don't care if it gets awkward because really why should I  But then she starts asking questions  Simple example would be "I went skiing on the weekend with everyone and it was great  What did you do " Kinda seems like she is trying to prove to me that she is better then me  I don't know and I really don't give a toss anymore So your goal is to get an understanding of how attractive you are  right  I asked myself the same question a while ago and this is the best test I could come up with    I'm not going to go into your test any further  because it's shit for the reasons I explained    1  Take a bunch of pictures of yourself  Good lighting  decent camera  neutral background  multiple angles  multiple facial expressions  smiling  not smiling   This takes some basic photography skills  you don't want poor picture quality to be a confounding factor  Make a collage with those pictures   2  Post said collage on an online rating site  I used 4chan soc rate threads and it worked out pretty well  though there might be other options  Put the ratings into an excel chart   3  Do this multiple times  preferably with 2 3 different collages  You need a good sample size or the result is meaningless  At the very least 30 ratings   4  Do simple statistical analysis  Average is obviously most important  but you should also calculate the confidence interval of that    facial features are independent from your fat body ratio  This is 100  incorrect  It's actually one of the very few ways very ugly people can get attractive  By losing weight  How much face fat you lose when going down in body weight depends on the person though I feel like this thread needed a trigger warning my mom says im handsome    I dont know if she will do the same to him  I disagree with that but I do agree with letting her have her time to deal with her boyfriend  You must be at least cuteI used to work in a pawn shop that had this crap happen all the time  Commonly thieves try to put stolen stuff on pawn so it's out of the way till the heat dies down    You dodged a bullet  if you listed these online you would likely get a police visit  I'd call them and explain the situation  Let them advise you what to do  Most of the time they will seize the items and contact the guy in your behalf to tell him what's going on  I'm really sorry that happened to you and I can imagine that it must've been really rough to deal with   The only thing to really do is to take this and use it as a learning experience in the future to try to prevent stuff like this from happening again   Also  try not to feel too down   Think about how sad this girl's life is if she has nothing better to do than to make a group chat and insult you like that on facebook   You shouldn't even feel angry at her  just feel bad for her that her life is so bad that she felt the need to do something like that   Honestly you deserve way better and you'll find someone who deserves you  I promise   Best of luck and feel free to pm me any time to talk   I kind of understand what you're going through and I'd be happy to talk or listen if you just want to vent I would like to express appreciation to this writer just for rescuing me from this type of problem  After scouting throughout the online world and seeing notions that were not pleasant  I believed my life was done I feel like with there being such a light shining on the mistreatment and abuse of kids in Hollywood it's likely going to be harder for people to take advantage because it will be more likely to blow up where as before it was like the Catholic church abuse  hushed up by those around the abuser and abused to save face  Saving face isn't really the culture anymore and being abused isn't a shame on the victim so much these daysI'm not even sure if that's it tbh  I remember feeling these effects since I was like 6 years old or something  I think my issue is that whatever I've had it's slowly affected me more and more seriously as I've grown up becuase i miss out on significant steps of developing properly  I have some sides of social life that I can manage but then others i just can't whatsoever and same with school  It went so well throughout most of middle school but then later grades slowly and then gradually started dropping because as far as I'm concerned I didn't even get what was going on half the time I was in high school  Every class was just me listening to 20  of the overall amount of conversations happening with the Teacher nah   I just rann for a few years   Ended up runnign with a guy who talked to everyone  It took me 3 years before I made my first friend but I didnt mind because I enjoyed running    Honestly dude you need to thank that girl for showing you who she really was and for rejecting you because you just dodged a bullet   Really more of a cannonball   I'm sure she has some good qualities  but is this someone that you really want to be with   Someone who knows how you feel about her and then tells you about all of the stuff that she's doing   The answer here is no   This girl isn't your friend in any way   You need to cut contact with her  forget that she ever existed  and find someone who deserves you   It isn't going to be easy but remember that you need to do what's best for YOU   Not whatever doesn't hurt her feelings   She doesn't seem to respect you and so you shouldn't really care how she feels   Obviously you don't need to be mean  but make sure you put your own needs first   Best of luck and feel free to pm me if you need to talk Ah I'm swooned Nothing you wrote specifically sounds narcissistic  he does sound like an abusive asshole though Wow man I just want to thank you for writing this  It means a lot to me  You really describe my Situation perfectly even though I am only 19 years old I think nothing will change and I'll stay alone when I dont start to change something  "It did however ignite a spark in me that I've never had before"  I hope it will be the same with me     Thank you and Good luck  True because it's not that serious    You shouldn't care what other people think about you   If something is bothering you  then fix it  If the problem is out of your control  then don't worry about it Yes  emailing or calling is for sure the way to go  I've found admissions counselors can be very helpful about how to frame yourself and your application  because if they can frame it in a positive light it ultimately makes their school statistics look better and helps bump enrollment Delivered Thank you  it really really helped me to hear this  I know realistically that this is part of the depression "talking" but it's hard to come to terms with on the receiving end  I appreciate you commenting with your experience a lot xI think I should probably conduct this experiment AFTER I lost weight in that case      I am about 40 50 lb overweight so that might be a huge factor if what you said it's true   BUT from the description of step 1 and you previous comment  you are basically eliminating the weight of any "purposely ugly picture" in an accurate attraction measurement You aren't worthless and should never think that you are   Everyone needs help at one point or another and there's absolutely no shame in asking for it   If this is about your ex fiance  remember that it's very normal to be sad about losing someone important in your life  even if they turned out to be a bad person   Always keep in mind though that time really does heal everything   Do your best to find things to take your mind off of what happened and do what you can to make yourself happy   Try to find some new hobbies or activities like going to the gym or volunteering just to take your mind off of everything and raise yourself up bit by bit   This won't all blow over in a day but over time things will slowly start to get better until one day you realize that you're happy about what happened because you were able to get out before you got married   You'll find someone awesome and then you'll be happy   Just give it time   Best of luck and also feel free to pm me if you need to talk Some antidepressants are really cheap  generic Prozac   let your doctor know you're on a budget  You may need to try a few to find one that works  If you can't get help at your college call 211 and find out about your areas low cost or free clinics and mental health facilities    Hang in there  medication can help Had a really bad day and went to get my pocket knife but couldn't find it   I started getting hysterical because I couldnt relax  I then thought how silly it was that I was desperate to cut myself    Every time after that  when I wanted to  I would think of that time    4 years going strong  Congrats  I'm so excited for you ouch It worked for me  and I suffered from depression between the ages of 10 and 24    That's 14 years of suicidal thoughts  self harm  and a bad relationship with constant demands on top  You'll reach a point where you're open enough for it to work on you  one day Just to me it seems like you're unconsciously distancing yourself from people because you don't forgive yourself for being mean and because you think it may happen again and you don't want to put more people through that   I think it would really help for you to keep some kind of journal or do some kind of writing to try to get to the bottom of how you're feeling   You may also want to try drawing as an outlet because some of the pictures you draw may be very good indicators of what you're really feeling deep down   You need to learn how to forgive yourself for the things that you did and remember that they were in the past   Try to take steps to improve and remember that no one is perfect  but as long as you're trying to better yourself there's really not much more that can be asked of you   I would also actually say that you may want to look into seeing a therapist just because of how long this has been going on   Best of luck and feel free to pm me if you want to talk I have left out a bit of detail being that I moved to this town about a year ago and made friends with her through work and started getting to know her friends so she was my link to the group if that makes sense  Anyway I would have went  I have before  but she said she and everyone else was invited to a persons place I've only met once  She didn't invite me or ask on my behalf or anything   Plot twist  today I found out they didn't even go there  they just went down the river and camped the night which lots of people apparently do in this town  I found out from someone who came into work when I asked them what they did for NYE and said they were down the river and they seen my "friends" their and asked why I wasn't there too  I felt like I had been hit with a ton of bricks because I previously said I had a quiet one and just stayed at home  The annoying thing is she seems like an angel 99  of the time  she just seems to keep using her way with words to get at me  Thanks everyone for the help  Its great to be able to talk to people about it and clear my mind  Kay    She made a fake profile of a guy and pretended to be my boyfriend for two years  She manipulated me and I attempted suicide  cause "he" told me he was doing it too and then disappeared    Last year I asked her about that and she confessed  I'm friends with her since I was 7  then she felt in love with me and started the fake profile  Obvsly  I don't really think she was in love with me  it went all very wrong  She was just mean after all  but I'm too lonely to get away from her  No worries  I always recommend two books to everyone  as they were books that helped me through the battleground of my teenage years  and it was a battleground which was alive at every angle  even the 'safe' ones   These are Sun Tzu's The Art of War  and Miyamoto Musashi's The Book of Five Rings  Go wherever you need to from those  you'll pick up some other titles if you study around them a little I'm so sorry and honestly no one deserves to be cheated on   Just remember that there's nothing that you could have done better and that it isn't your fault in any way   It's entirely her problem   I know it's weird to say  but try to be happy that you found out now instead of wasting more time in a relationship with this girl   She doesn't deserve you and you don't deserve what happened   Look to the future and find someone awesome  then look back and laugh at how sad your ex's behavior was and at the realization that she won't find anyone as good as you   Best of luck and stay strong   Also feel free to pm me any time if you want to talk or vent Lifting weights will make you stronger and more fitOof  the multiple bottles of soda  Been there  I still think back to how bad that period of depression was   Edit  Oh gosh  my first thought was Mountain Dew  not pee Cheating is hurtful because you're devaluing the other person in the relationship as not being worth the honesty or commitment to the values you agreed to going into the relationship   You can choose to be polyamorous  There are plenty of people who choose that lifestyle  but they are happy with this because they are honest with themselves and their partners about what they are doing want to do  Poly relationships have rules too   rules that it would sometimes feel good to break   but people in good poly relationships do not do this either  Nothing different is required in monogamy  honesty with yourself  your partner  and commitment loyalty to adhere to the rules you have set forth in your relationship even when sometimes it would  feel good  to do otherwise  Relationships are about being honest about your desires  setting boundaries both partners are happy with  keeping your partner s ' trust about those boundaries  and communicating honestly if circumstances about your desires change  and then learning to deal with those changes together  Post this over at r disability   they would know  I'm too rusty to remember the rule correctly but it's something like can you preform this job with reasonable accommodation  in which case you could   I personally wouldn't disclose during an interview but please cross post for best answer I'm so sorry to hear about what happened and I understand that it's really hard to go through that because I kind of went through something similar     Just remember that it's ok to be sad and that it's a normal response to this kind of thing   Try to take some time to be sad and to let it all out   Also try to do some things to distract yourself from the pain and lift your spirits  even if it's just temporary   Honestly  the only thing that will help here is time and over time you'll notice that you'll be getting better and better   One thing that I need to say and that you need to keep in mind is that he did love you and I can promise you that   What he said was a complete lie and I don't even need to know him or you to know that that's true   Also remember that you need to cut contact and if he tries to get back in contact either politely decline or ignore him   Do what's best for you to make the healing process go smoothly   Best of luck and stay strong   Also feel free to pm me at any time if you ever want to talk or vent God will not send you girlfriend  How do you expect to break from being single if you just recieve what is given to you in life Dec  baby here still gave me 2016 Inguinal hernia can occur at any age  this is because as you get older  the muscles surrounding your abdomen  tummy  can become weaker and

describes me perfectly How do I pm  I'm on iPhoneJust a thought  how old is this guy  It would cost a little but a strongly worded letter from a lawyer threatening legal might do the trick  Or you haven't discovered how low you'll go  yet  The app requires you pay for it to send messages   that is a massive red flag  that is a terrible app to use I think I should probably conduct this experiment AFTER I lost weight in that case      I am about 40 50 lb overweight so that might be a huge factor if what you said it's true   Oh yeah  with this much weight it's going to make a large difference  Please just make sure to lose the weight in a sustainable way  Don't rush it or do something crazy    BUT from the description of step 1 and you previous comment  you are basically eliminating the weight of any "purposely ugly picture" in an accurate attraction measurement   Yes  sorta   It's important to distinguish between different kinds of ugly images  Those of bad angles and those of bad image quality  When you make the collage you want to include images of unflattering angles but you don't want to include images that have terrible lighting  This way you hopefully eliminate the "purposely ugly picture"   Then in the collage the rating person will both see the more ugly and the more attractive pictures of you that are all representative of the real you  This way they will be able to give you a rating that takes everything into account You remind me of my son  I hope one day he will get over the same complex one day  Good for you and Congratulations     I found college was sort of the middle  there were sorta no cool groups and everyone was really accommodating  You really had to isolate yourself hard to be left out but that was just my experience  I think American college culture is very different  assuming your American sorry    School was shit  There were as you say exclusive cool groups  But I found after school generally the cool kids seem to be the ones who dropped to the bottom of the social ladder  They either didn't get into college because they were to busy socializing and missed out on a more balanced social life of college or were too far up their own you know what that the real world of social life rejected them  Sometimes they stayed in groups but no one else really wanted to associate with them anymore  In the end karma comes around  But to answer your question a little more yeah you can be the cool one but notice the lack of plurals there  There aren't cool groups anymore  just cool individuals so get out and work on it yourself  don't expect to be lifted up by others  Unless you join a country club or something of the like  That's just my experience  I feel my countries culture is very different to most parts of the world when it come to social life so it may be wrong for you  Thank god for that Maybe  I didn't start masturbating until I was 19  Dumbest fucking mistake ever    Oh  the wet dreams    While I am romantically alone  I am lucky to say there would be plenty of people who would be devastated in the event of my demise  Glad I could help  Sounds like you got a plan and that's all you need to start Best bet is to be honest with them  The longer you wait the worse it gets  Remember though  college is about pursuing your passion  and its you who chooses what that is  What do you think might be bad  or what specifically are you curious about  "work dynamic" feels kind of vague    I sometimes prefer to be at work because it's  something to do  and it's the only non internet human interaction I have  Though oddly every day when my shift ends I'm like  rushing to pack up and get out  Then I'm walking home thinking  "WTF was I in such a hurry for  What am I even going to do when I get home "Sounds like an issue for the police   Thank you for your advice  It gives me a lot to think about    It is definitely the worst part about owning a pet  You have to rationalize it  If your pet is suffering   can't eat   can't walk struggles to use the bathroom    then you are essentially doing it a favor and being there with it while it passes  You are their comfort and it's important that you see to it that your pet is peacefully put to sleep I do go to yoga class  But most people are there for yoga  not for talking or socializing    I don't really approach women  I still have some things I need to take care of before I start doing that   I'm not really a good looking guy so I have to work on myself physically some more so I can balance it out and meet the standards all the other guys set This is how a lot of girls feel actually  obligated by their "date" to preform in some way  I'm sure you feel weird for cheating  trying a homo experience and all that but I'd put money on the reason for your squidgy feeling being that you essentially violated yourself by performing when you weren't attracted or comfortable   You found out you have boundaries and you need to respect them in the future  Sometimes it can take some time before we learn how to do this correctly  You'll be ok  I think  Best of luck    Edit to add  Also you wanted to know what was wrong with you  You may just be a teenaged boy  or you may have some impulsive issues  I've basically done what you did but I do have impulsive issues  BPD   If you're often regretful or impulsive actions take over your life you'll want to seek some help at the most it should work the opposite  judge s  decide if the accused is guilty  and popular jury in case of guilty verdict chooses the extent of the punishment in between the min max defined by the law by judging their behaviourBring in and worst case scenario you don't need it What i don't understood is actually how you are no longer actually a lot more neatly preferred than you may be now  You are very intelligent  You recognize therefore significantly in relation to this matter  made me for my part imagine it from numerous varied angles  Its like women and men don't seem to be interested except it¡¦s something to do with Girl gaga  Your own stuffs great  All the time deal with it up What i do not understood is in truth how you're now not actually much more neatly liked than you may be right now  You are very intelligent  You realize thus significantly on the subject of this subject  produced me in my opinion believe it from so many numerous angles  Its like men and women aren't fascinated except it is one thing to accomplish with Lady gaga  Your own stuffs excellent  All the time care for it up She should knit hats and scarves and sell them on etsy Life is not a movie  There is no formula  You hang out with people who make you happy  and approach people you find attractive  That mindset won't help you with anything  Oh  wow  That is tragic  I think you should definitely get away from this person  No doubt that your colon is going to rupture soon  Once you start going though it'll ease up the pain and you will slowly feel better  Right now you are probably experiencing a fullness and slight nausea  Take a peptoSo what If you like your job  be careful about dating your coworker Do it    You won't always have chances thrown at you  so it's kind of stupid to sit one out   Your coworkers are shitty if they don't understand  and the bulk of them would take it themselves if offered  I have never made a post on this site  Hi  Is it Ok if I ask anything kinda off subject  I'm wanting to view this page on my new iPad but it will not show up correctly  do you have any solutions  Must I try and discover an update for my software or something  Thanks in advanceI don't feel qualified to answer this but thought there is a chance you may get something out of it so here goes  Start small  Push your boundaries a little but and keep getting more and more adventurous  Start with something like small talking with people behind the checkout or in line  Once you get more confident work your way up but start small  What is small for you  Maybe you always chat up checkout chicks  so that may be too easy idk haha  Anyway I wouldn't go straight out to a bar alone  I would take a few friends as a safety net  not that you really need them it just helps you be more at ease knowing you can always go back and talk with them if you find it too much and try again a bit later  You don't feel like so much of a loner and if people ask what your doing you can say I'm just down here with my friends so people don't think your some sort of creep trying to abduct someone or some bullshit  If you don't have any good friends maybe join some sort of club  Sports club or art groups but make sure its something you are interested in   Also remember that everyone get anxious in social situations from time to time  probably more often then you realize  When you approach people yourself you are probably making them a little anxious too so try to make them feel comfortable  That tip really helped me   Also remember that as long as you are being pleasant some other people are just assholes and don't want to talk to anyone or care about others at all so if you get a rude response its their problem and not yours  You don't deserve to be treated with disrespect and shouldn't waste anymore time on them   Hope this helps Some of your points and the OP made me realize that I don't want to be a popular or cool social guymfantastic post  very informative  I'm wondering why the other experts of this sector don't understand this  You must continue your writing  I'm sure  you've a great readers' base already Better get your tea leaves read Its probably freeing because if you commit suicide one day then you won't leave anyone feeling devastated over your death  what state  i recommend growing medical cannabis Yeah  that's going to be a big challenge  I'm definitely on the more gentlemanly side At least he'll be there at all    I struggled with this a lot up until recently  I had this vision of who I must become and I never seemed to get as close as I wanted to  Like you it made me unhappy    One day things sort of clicked  I realized we won't ever become our ideal self two reasons   1  We are not perfect and we never will be  Like you said you lowered your expectations for yourself overtime  That is exactly what you should do  Lower the bar just enough to leave room for some self forgiveness and off days    2  Also like you said our ideal self is ever evolving  You have to be flexible enough to roll with the changes in yourself and your environment    Ultimately what worked for me in getting out of this hopeless chase for my ideal self was planning out this idea of my perfect self having a perfect day  Taking the time to think and write it out  This is not a static document  It will change with you  You can erase portions and add portions  And the goal is to try your experiment the best you can each and everyday  My goal is to get up to 90  of my ideal self every day  And since I call it an experiment I give myself permission to fail  Hope this helps  Sorry if it rambled on    How GG my man do you understand why this isn't common practise My sister is about your age and is just now recovering from addiction  She dealt with a great amount of shame about decisions she made in her life  who she was  It sounds like you are hard on yourself  It sounds like you haven't exactly had it easy  so the fact that your life isn't great at 27 isn't a sign that who you are on the inside is a failure  You're still young enough to turn it around   I think when your friends say to stop being so hard on yourself  they aren't saying that you shouldn't try and be better  They're saying you shouldn't hate yourself  You shouldn't beat yourself up  It'll make you think you're not worth it and it'll prevent you from putting in the effort to improve  And it sounds like you're on the up right now  regardless If you think you might be suppressing some Chadditude then try it out and report back  r exnocontact is one of the places I go to   He's an ex for a reason  Make new friends and let this one go I think your health is more important than school  Go see a doctor  get a proper diagnosis and ideally a cure  Everything else is secondary I'm not sure what app you use but if you have alien blue you can go down to the "enter a user" and type my username  then my profile should come up and you can send a pm  Thanks man  or lady   Will do   I haven't been to the doctors yet but I will ask and see if I can do that instead of today because I have been takeing cold meadaice and as I do feel a little bit better not alot  But as for summer school im honestly trying to not have to go to it  If there's a online version and I have to at the end of the year it won't be so bad but right now I think I should probably go to the doctors You are in high school   Don't let high school drama bother you That was kind of a hot read   So idk what to do about this but I can see how it would be a confusing thing to deal with  But you can't help what you're into  and since you can't help it  there's no use worrying about it  But I know it's not easy to just stop worrying   I would speak to a therapist   tell them everything and ask their advice  If anything they might at least be able to prescribe some methods that'll make it so you can figure out what to do Congratulations my dude  Hope all goes wellI definitely wish I had had the courage to do this at your age  Instead I now feel like I kind of missed out on a big part of my 20's  So I really hope you manage to make that change  I know you can do it    Call childs servicesI can't do that because I have a large family  I have 6 siblings and we all live together and vary in ages but most of them are young  Well been to the doc about those and they don't know what's causing it  And they're the one that gave me meadaice for it  Right now though I ment I'm sick as hell and I IV miss alot of school beacuse of migranes  But I have been sick for the past 4 5 days and I might be able to make it a half of day or something today but tomarrow I know I just won't be able to with gymWow  your situation  well    before yesterday  sounds a lot like mine  Just change out the 32 for 28  In about a month  I'll be moving into a new apartment  my first place without anyone else living with me  and I was planning on starting this stuff after that  Thanks for the inspiration and good luck  Hope the future works out for both of us  And if your dad don't do anything  your kid is at risk what  get myself drugged and wander wobbling up to girls  hhahaI'm sorry dude  that really sucks  Maybe join some clubs or something where you could meet more guy friends I honestly think they will turn out like how the harry potter cast turned out not too bad i believe Yep and I just found out today is going to be a sucky day beacuse I can't go the regular doctor beacuse my dad hasent pays the bill so I guess I got to go for 1 2 a dayI think he killed himself for other reasons  This washould not in anyway your fault  It's been a couple of days since I thought about posting something similar on askreddit  I thought about asking something in the lines of "those of you who feel happy and completed  tell us about you"  But I didn't find any good way to phrase the question  which I think is very important to get a post in askreddit upvoted  So if you are up to it  go ahead   Fuck yeah  Nice work   Maybe  Maybe I'll just wait it out  I can be funny again in college I guess  Why  It's super fun   u linamina526  If you remove all of the relationship stuff  I could reinstate it   But for the moment  I have removed it   Please go read the rules i usually dont hate people for being pedophile  as long as they dont act on it  but your brother has done a lot of wrong shit  if you want him out of your life  cut him out  That's a great way of looking at it  Thanks Oh sweetie  I'm so  so sorry  Please take care of yourself  Drink some water  eat something even if it's only crackers  Take a good  hot  steamy shower  You're grieving  and you deserve to take care of yourself    It will get better with time You could add drops of essential oil to the vinegar  Vinegar will kill fungus so it's a good choice  You can also try some rubbing alcohol  General foot health will help as well  Wash your feet at least once  maybe twice a day drying between your toes  Give yourself a pedicure and remove any dead skin and keep your nails short    You may want to look into antimicrobial socks  yikes  trust that girl not to believe in that shittalkYou said to wear clothes with sheep material and then said oil in response to op asking what sheep meant  Neither of these things make sense alone nor paired  Did you mean sheer material or something I hope you two are on good terms  It really sucks if you have a sibling like that   throwing it in your face  Well that's going to be a long life of misery until you realize that caring what others think about you is quite silly   Be yourself and do what makes you happy  if others don't like it then obviously they don't care for you   You must not have many problems in your life to let such little things get to you  If you lived 500 years ago and had to worry about gathering food and not getting eaten by lions  you'd realize how silly and un rational you are being   Maybe you care about what people think about you due to not being "good looking" as you would like to be    Everyone wishes they were better looking    If you want to be depressed and mope around over silly stuff  it's your life  I see tons of non good looking people who know how to socialize and be themselves because they don't care what others think and people respect them for it   You can go to a doctor and ask how to socialize or you can go practice it and learn 1 day at a time   or you can sit in your room and be depressed and wish dang why doesn't the world like me and I'm so weird    You have every right to be upset  If it would be the other way around  youd be instantly called a homophobe   Fuck them  Doesnt matter that they are gay  they are just bad friends Thanks for your time and effort but problem is   i really cant stand a job i just dont want to do a job to get money so i can support myself i dont want to do all that iknow it sounds lazy and maybe i am but i really hate having a jobYeah  why not  Benzos will kill your inhibitions fast and you'll be able to see whether you're a Chad in FA clothing What are you talking about   70 is the new 50 When I started university I pretended like I was super confident and forced myself to speak to everyone  even people walking passed me  people just knew me as that really confident social guy  done that for about half a year and now its just who I am   I still have my insecure demons of course  but hey  I'm getting there   I feel for you  Our dog lived until 18  She was beautiful and it  still  hurts to think about her  or any other pet I've had to take to the vets to get put down  It's a horrible experience  Truly one of the worst things I've had to deal with  There isn't much you can do other than make the most of the time you've got    Although  I do wish we had more photos of our pets  We didn't have digital cameras then  so what few photos we have are precious  So take lots of photos aw   me irl is the Russian roulette of karma  I've seen comments that are innocent that get bombarded with downvotes  and when someone else posts the same thing  it's more upvoted Not really  I don't like parties or even drinking and definetly don't want to do that alone  I prefer a small circle  And since I have no Chance with hot girls  I won't be approaching them  Ddude I dont even know where to start with the partnership this feels like you expect ALOT from me  we need to talk more please feel free to add me on steam  http   steamcommunity com id marvinsbody123  seriously please talk more to me Would I get a moment of silence from a few people  Sure  Devastated  No one I know you've said that you get the cliche of joining clubs  but I think it's a little bit more nuanced than that  It's not a question of joining a club or society that does something you're interested in  rather its more important to join a club with people you're interested in and would be interested in you    For example you might really like lacrosse  but if you don't like the people you're not gonna make any number of friends  Whereas something like ultimate Frisbee  which possibly you've never played before  might have people you get on great with  and from personal experience I've found ultimate to be a much friendlier environment than traditional sports   I don't know much about the U S but I assume it can't be that different from the UK  where certain sports clubs generally speaking attract certain types of people  I would argue that in terms of finding friends you should be looking for groups of people you get on with not necessarily  just an activity you enjoy   Plus the second obvious thing people always say but I think is pretty true  is you have to take the initiative when meeting new people  Even if you suffer setbacks a lot  most people don't get a ton of invites if they're also not giving anything back I have to agree with Tryingtoairsoftlife It wasn't your fault  there's clearly more there in his life that would've pushed him to this  but oh gosh I'm sorry Definetely report and get steam supportWhen I was young  I worked and worked   Before I was old enough to work elsewhere  I worked at home with my dad  the bastard   and every time I did something that pissed him off  I would be punished with work     It wasn't until I got old enough to get out of the house and get a job that I realized that the people at "work" weren't nearly the asshole that he was  Work was a joyful place on the best days  and a satisfactory place on the worst of days   And     I wonder if this aversion to work resulted from something like what my dad used to do   Let me ask you this   If you don't want to work to support yourself  how would you support yourself   Maybe you can do something different   Live off of the land in the national forests   What do you want to do with your life SQL injection  aahhh  the most primitive form of database penetration  I'm really surprised that a university is vulnerable to SQL injection  something that takes literally 1 line of PHP code to fix  How did you manage to do that  Was it as simple as manipulating the input on the web interface  or did you have backend access  Okay   "incessant" was the proper term after I read all the responses This way of thinking helped me    Think of your life like a train operator  You have a lot of people stepping on and off your train  If you become fond of one of your passengers and they get off your train  you keep that train moving forward  Sometimes people step back on the train  sometimes they don't  But you have to keep moving forward  I say leave  if you know what you're worth go out and get what you're worth   I think I just unknowingly quoted Rocky for a moment  It sounds like more stress shit than it's worth so there's no point in staying  Especially if you believe you can find something better in IT  or anything else   Good luck  friend What do u meanIf you had to get down on one knee and propose to one of them right now  who would you choose  That's the one you should be dating  Writers arent born with innate talent my friend  If you want to be a writer you must write every day for at least 6 hours  If you arent even making that effort thrn u have no idea what u r capable of  U will suprise yourself  Everyone has a voice that can be sharpened and cultivated Believe it or not a lot of guys do that  and girls notice 95  of the time  Make firm eye contact and maintain it  I would recommend joining a friendly  perhaps less serious team sport society  At first your interaction with others will be focused around an objective  Over time  this will be a good way to build friendships The biggest mistake you can do right now is thinking she's the last and only chance you'll have at a relationship  because that's a surefire way of screwing it up  She's not  and there are lots of other girls out there who'd be happy to have you    It might work out or it might not  but either way it's not a big deal  Even if it doesn't  at least you'll have learned a lot that you will be able to take with you to the next time  Toss it  You can buy more things  Why does he deserve the girl I second the neurological issue thing  In some ways your description reminds me of my ADHD  It's incredibly hard to multitask with ADHD  ADHD is characterized by a much lower level of stimulation from the mental motivation and reward system  While the name makes it sound like the person can't pay attention to things  the problem is often the opposite  Once that person finds something that finally does stimulate the reward system  the whole rest of the would disappears and they fall into a state called hyperfocus where all they can do is chase that natural high that this activity is giving   a drive that the majority of necessities in life fail to create  This can involve binge working on a hobby into wee hours of the morning  forgetting about meals and bathroom breaks until the body is at its breaking point and can't wait to eat sleep pee any longer  The walking into doors or forgetting things like light switches and vitamins could be a matter of being so mentally sucked into one thing that their mind isn't devoting enough processing power to the mundane things around them   You might check out r adhd to see if it sounds similar to your spouse  I'm sure there are other neurological disorders that have overlap as well so I wouldn't recommend diagnosing him her without consulting a professional  but this could be a launching point to learning effective ways to cope with whatever is affecting your partner   There is a video that really helped me to understand why I have been so broken in all my life  I don't have the hyperactive type of ADHD and wasn't a disruptive child  so I didn't get diagnosed until I was 30 and so sick of being a failure at adulthood and so depressed at not being able to keep my affairs in order  It's 30 minutes long  but this speaker   Dr  Russell Barkley  https   m youtube com watch v Li tcua0AJI   shined such a light on how my brain works  I don't know where I'd be right now without the realization that my brain is wired differently and learning that there are coping techniques and medicines that can bring me closer to normalcy in my life and make it easier to remember important things What's he doing  We should know so we can stay away from it From my experience just being my awkward self was enough  so my advice to you is that you don't need to do anything more than that  All you have to do is muster up the courage to be honest and ask her out on date   It's as tough as wrestling a bear  you'll make a thousand excuses  I sure as heck did  but if you can do that friend you're already taking the first step  Worse case scenario is she says no or that she doesn't feel the same way  in that case you have to remember she is only a crush  I've had a ton in my life  and wait for love to come around again   I'm quite terrible at explaining myself but I really do wish you the best  you seem like a good guy Friend  may I ask you how it came to this  I am new to this sub  and I really do not want to come across as demeaning  but I cannot fathom how this can happen to people     How old are you  What do you do in life  job school      If that's not too much to askStep one  decide what your dream is   Step two  research said dream   Step three  build out a list of stepping stones and objectives to follow the dream   Step four  work every day towards achieving the next objective   Step five  bask in the glory of achievement    Remember to plan for your dream  Be as specific as possible when looking for your goal  and think about it every day  Make it your passion  what gets you up in the morning  If you have a clear goal in mind  and you make that your only priority  nothing will stop you   We have no idea  when we went out to get the cat it ran away  No farms around us have seen  it  it migth have found its way back to his hers owners cabine  where we think the dog came from  Do what you want  But from what i read you are trying to cater for your anxiety not for yourself   You don't need alcohol to have fun  Let the girls decide if you have a chance with them  since now you are just cocblocking yourself  999 hot girls will reject you  and then you will find one that thinks you are perfect  Guess what you don't need 999 girls  only one  to lead a fulfilling life For starters  I don't believe that you only feel anger or hate  If you did  this post wouldn't exist    I think that the first thing you need to do is start listing 5 good things about a person you come into contact with  Then tell them one of those things  See the joy it brings to someone's face when you genuinely compliment them    Also  avoid any friendships that start on hatred  They only make things worse  A 'lifa dry' balaclava might help with the neck  talk to me mandatory at 3 30 3 00 ish today I have school   And you pulled things out of my original response which I hadn't insinuated  Tit for tat amigo feeling left out is the worstYour health as well as others over your education  definitely stay at home   If you're worried you could ask for your schoolwork to be brought to you or switch to home schooling online courses  A great leader will admit when they are wrong  When you feel that there is a disagreement  calmly ask the other person to state their case  If they are correct  admit that you were wrong  And if it is something that does not have a correct answer  agree to disagree  If you have a patient that you want to sifted anywhere in the world  Dont worry Medivic Aviation is best to choose for you  Because we provide advanced  safest and happy services to our patients  We provide fully configured air ambulance with the latest technology that provides best Air Ambulance Services in Abu Dhabi  For more call us  9560123289 and schedule our transport Dude   one day at a time   You may want to seek out other recovering alcoholics that you can relate to because these thoughts are pretty common for those that recently have become sober   Oh  and at 27  time is on your side  it really is  You just need to let it flow and see where it takes you    You are getting control over your life  It's a journey and it's hard  but that's what control brings in the beginning This doesn't change how organs are allocated  A family would still have the opportunity to directly donate  to his brother  for example   You don't seem to know much about the process or Organ donation  you should be cautious which what commentary you put out there  In the US people's lives depend on how donation is perceived  Be honest thats what I want to do but you have to pay for online school I think  But I think I want to to that beacuse 1 I could get my work done faster and at any time and 2 I might only be 15 now but then I can make money online or part time job or something  But I also don't even see that point of high school now like honestly I just eather want to get into a trade skill or do something online like YouTube or veido editeding Reading this reminds me of my previous room mate  That guy was one of the smartest people I know  but he was a little outlandish for my tastes though  Anyways I appreciated reading this  thanks  Will give me something to discuss when I see him If this is for me  I have already done so       It felt GREAT   It annoys SJWs  We do what we can Yep  but I am not going to find that one at a party where I don't want to be anyway   I don't need alcohol to have fun  but I don't enjoy parties regardless of alcohol  Still not seeing any difference Well parties are just gatherings of different people that have come to have fun  You just don't know how to enjoy them yet  However ridiculous it sounds it's a skill  Not very hard but a skill    I've used to think just as you  often felt excluded at the parties and seeked comfort of my small closed friends circle  changed completely since then and i don't look back  Quality of life is so much higher right now  so I made sure to read up on some open ended questions the night before  What questions Are you still living with your parents  If so  do you think that this may affect that at all if you tell your mom Don't put yourself in that situation  He's only looking for one thing and although he may throw you crumbs  he'll end up using you and playing you for a fool   Just sensationalist titties  I prefer Cucumbers    I am happy to know thatthey know what my projects are  they just dont understand how hard it is to do because the school im studying in has a high standard and has high expectationsThere are quite a few online public schools where you don't need to pay any fees  but you would have to talk to your parents about enrolling you as it's like any other school if you're serious about it  If I were you I'd take a look at a few options with my family though instead of just settling on the first one I see on Google  Good luckWell this living situation is not going to get better if they are living with a drunk  The family is stuck until they can leave   For the time being  tell your girlfriend that when she is away from there  it is sanctuary  What ever hell takes place there  stays there  Outside of there is sanctuary   You need to help her see that there is good and bad and they can coexist as long as you never bring the bad into the good   That's the concept of sanctuary  Outside is good and she can leave the bad there I have my family  but don't see much of them  Apart from that I have no friends and no one that cares about me  so yeah pretty much alone  Medivic Aviation organization is exceedingly devoted  talent  responsible and reliable air ambulance sector  Because we provide latest facilities to our patients at very low Air Ambulance Services in Kathmandu  We sifted many of emergency and nonemergency patients anywhere in a Kathmandu hospital we have highly enthusiastic MD Doctor and medical staff that they are well trained in the medical sector  We are 24 7 hours and 365 days ready for moving patients  Thank you  I really appreciate the reply      My friend said the same thing  but I feel it may be inappropriate to ask her out at her work as someone she's not familiar with  My biggest worry is that I don't want to pressure her or make her feel uncomfortable by asking her out like that if it's not appropriate  but I honestly am not really sure   I'll definitely keep your advice in mind  and if simply asking her like that is my best option  I'll make sure I overcome anxiety to go through with it   DNo  I have been to enough parties to know that I don't enjoy them  In the end I did just go there to take a women home and since that didn't happen often for me  I often just had a bad time for nothing     It might work out or it might not  but either way it's not a big deal  Even if it doesn't  at least you'll have learned a lot that you will be able to take with you to the next time   Yeah  that's how I'm trying to look at it So do you want him to change for you or do you want to change for him  The tasks we do on a day to day basis aren't very challenging for someone with 3 years experience  Sure if I was a newbie  I would be amazed  but the stuff I am doing makes me feel like I'm going back on myself    Just looking for second opinions    Love the Rocky quote by the way   r stopdrinking   I'm not a drinker myself  but their community is amazing Okay  thanks  I'll keep my stuff here from now on   I know I'm late to this  but google whatever law firm he works at  see if he's legit  If he is  don't let fear overcome you like so many morons commenting here are suggesting  I've known a few friends who went through this same scenario  and every time it ended with them getting awesome jobs working for these guys  Seriously  if he's a fucking lawyer  he can't even have police suspect him of anything without him losing his license  Fear culture is obscene in the modern world  If he gets creepy  then dip out  if he's cool  score an awesome job  You're totally in control Pope recently declared that cremating bodies is no good for Catholics  Seems you are going to need your body come resurrection time  Cant be resurrected without all your gibbets together Your body  your decision   I'm absolutely pro choice  and people here seem to be forgetting the "choice" part of that Without reading the article  I'm going to guess  since psychedelics are illegal  it's hard to obtain them for research purposes I like work because it keeps me busy and keeps my mind off of being Forever Alone  Most people at work try hard to avoid me  and when they can't they treat me like the repulsive creature that I am  There are a minority of people that are nice to me  but they make it clear that they would never hang out with me outside of work  There is an app like Tinder for sex offenders When u base your self worth on the actions of other people and why they wont fuck you or touch u or hang out u are going to be depressed  Dont be lazy  nobody gave u free value in this life apparently  Maybe u r ugly as shit  Its time to add value to yourself  Looks are so stupid when compared to any great achievement  Honestly  either one would be good  I just want to not have this guilt hiding in our relationship   I've tried for two years to change myself  though  and so far I haven't really gotten anywhere with changing my sexual preferences  I'd hoped my attraction would change as my feelings for him grew  but it has only helped me overlook it  rather than actually become attracted to it  You don't "know you don't enjoy them"  you don't know "how to enjoy them"  It's a skill  Same with girls  You are a hostage of your limiting beliefs  If you or somebody need of medical air transportation  you can rely on Air Ambulance  Medivic Aviation provides you high quality and enthusiastic Air Ambulance Services in Dhaka  We are highly enthusiastic on every phase of your trip  We are the best option for those patients who too sick  We have all latest

    And called it a dayHi  thanks for sharing  It's nice to hear from someone else who has the same thoughts  I'm afraid I don't have book suggestions  I usually just read fanfics on archiveofourown  with the non con filter  of the series I'm familiar with  Eh  but sometimes I read fics that seem interesting as well even if I don't know the fandom    I can link some if you'd like   Also uh myreadingmanga info  tags section below can find you some works of interest  If you have book recommendations or recommendations of any kind  send them my way  Also it's not that they are bad  it's that I don't have any friends to celebrate New Year with  because I don't have any friends This post has been removed    r Health does not allow images  screenshot and other pictures   If you are

idea what my point was about    But fret not  I will use the power of copy paste and we're back on track      You were dying of alcohol poisoning and her friends thought your delusional and painful ramblings were cause for a breakup    I can only hope my girlfriend won't be angry at me when I'm dying and delusional       And this time with the director's comment       You see  I was pointing out that judging someone's behavior  during the process of dying  is a rather ill timed moment to base your opinion about someone on       The additional statement about my girlfriend was actually secondary to the first statement  It served merely to underline the strangeness of being angry at a person on his or her behavior while dying       Your focus on the secondary statement  and stating that this is in fact a reasonable judgment call tells me you find this practice acceptable  which I find horrid    Or that you dismiss the effect of alcohol poisoning on the brain    I was defaulting to the less horrid opinion you may hold    You did not insinuated this    Bit of an oversight on your part then ehIts not even remotely the same  You get to reject others who want to b friends  U arent getting rejected Perspective  something you should try to use      If you're a guy and are into girls   First thing off is that being around someone who acts weak and doesn't know how to deal with adversity is something someone does not want to be around     Maybe you have social anxiety because you know that you're not fun to be around  Nobody wants to be around someone who complains and whines about such unmeaningful things    I know society tries to put a lid on being a "man" but most girls want to be around someone who possesses traits of a man   Being weak minded and complaining is something nobody wants to be around and sure as hell wouldn't want children with someone who's going to teach them to be the same way   Either way  I try to give you a little "perspective" and advice on how to deal with such petty things as caring what "random" people think about you    You would think one would have passed through this phase at the age of 13   I'm assuming your parents nurtured you too much and didn't prepare you for the real world   I'm not writing this to try and make you feel better and to give you some kind of bullshit advice that's not going to help you improve and grow as a person    This is something I would say to my best friend or someone I care about   Most people like to see other people feeling down and depressed because it makes them feel better about themselves  Most of the world could give a shit about anybody and mostly self serving and selfish  I know you might kind of be stating the obvious  but thank you very much  Your words have kind of helped me think of it in a different way  I don't know how to explain it  But thank you  this really helps  Honestly I have an irrational paranoia of older guys hiding the fact that they already have kids since I don't want kids at all that I'd be all over someone if they told me they were a virgin    lol eharmony  They don't even try to steal my money  Both times I answered their questionnaire they said that they couldn't match me with anyone Specifically for you  try lifting clubs or becoming a TA  TAs have super high grades usually don't rage as much and that could be something your comfortable with  General advice tho    If you have the funds  join a sorority   They get shat on a lot on here  but I'm in a frat  male version  of 120 guys  best decision I've ever made  Always someone to hangout with  you meet tons of other kids from other houses  dudes  it's dope gives you a little community   Having dorm pregame also works  like get a few burnetts handles and invite your roommate and her friends  knock on doors of guys you want to hookup with and tell them it's a great way to meet people    If you see a girl in your class even though you have a 4 0 ask for notes  study sessions   Ask your roommate  It's humbling  and most times people are nice  If you didn't say anything first semester she probably thinks you just don't like going out  I'd say "hey girl  I was super swamped with work last semester didn't meet too many people   anyway I could tag along with you tonight" and then introduce yourself to everyone and be yourself   Clubs are there  but it's really about finding a group of people to support you  So yes join clubs  but understand most times it's going to be a few people within that club that are you become close with    You seem like a smart girl that has her shit together just get out of your shell a little more And why did you guys stick to kisses only  Cause she was a lesbian   But was she still a virgin phisically  I used to think there'd be no reason you wouldn't want to be an organ donor  until I heard a story from a family member about how much less time they give you in the hospital to recover from a life threatening injury because every second they wait your organs could be saving someone else's life that is more likely to live  Definitely a scary thought  I'd at least still want to be given the same chance without that sort of bias  Made me even think about opting out  Anyone else heard of this I'd say move  but I'm probably biased because I don't even remember exactly who I was friends with in highschool  and it was only a few years ago for me  If you're going to be attending university in the future then you're most likely going to end up going to different universities  maybe in different states  and you'll make new friends there anyway    One year isn't a very long time  and you'll have a good excuse to focus on your studies more  Okay first of all  I'm sorry that this is affecting you so badly  I have some ideas as to how you could perhaps alter your online presence a little to alleviate the issues    I think some people see 'downvote me' as a legit challenge  Personally I dont downvote for just disagreeing with a point  most subs stipulate that you shouldnt do this  but people do  A lot  I think also that it can come across as a bit antagonistic    The issue is with reddit  is not that its the thought police  but that the voting system depends on sub  user and even how they're feeling that day  some people downvote for stupid reasons  but you cant always stop that    Most people also go into post history  I dont personally  unless it is someone that doesnt seem quite plausible  or I've had some sort of interaction with them previously  e g  looking up past posts on particular subreddits  The problem I see with yours  is that straight away  there's posts about being an internet troll  People will not take what you say seriously if you've already admitted trolling people  also your post history states you troll gaming subs  which is a LOT of your posts  People will downvote trolling  Its automatic to then have a poor karma based on that    I dont think it's your opinion that makes people downvote  I think its the way you discuss things  again  admitting freely on reddit that you dislike and dont trust women  isnt going to gain you any sympathy  I can see why you feel that way  given your past  but a lot of people tend to try and overcome those feelings at some point    My point is you're saying you dont want to be labelled as a troll  but you have done just that in your post history  You labelled yourself already  Perhaps stick to the smaller subs where you can gain nice connections with regulars  Not everyone can spell  or type  or any of that  it doesnt mean your ideas are worth any less  Your comments might be tainted by the post you made calling yourself a troll  Maybe make an alt account  I see where you're coming from  Thanks for the comment  it was helpful     I could very likely get a girl if I lowered my standards to ones that I'm not even remotely attracted to  One can have standards and still be FA As we know that London is one of the most beautiful cities in the worlds but there is no any global coverage air ambulance service provider accept Medivic Aviation  We sifted patient anywhere in the world  We have no any

picture to make mostly negative personal assumptions about the guys  The bodybuilder is probably a meathead  the model looking ones are douches  the young ones are innocent and too nice etc  etc   Also let's not forget that no woman would go on this show and say "I'd fuck em all" because she wouldn't want to appear easy  Also some of them would be incredibly intimidated in person so they are using this opportunity to feel an air of superiority to a situation that would otherwise have them feeling inferior Okay   you have a lot going on  Let's put what you "are" to the side  All it is doing is confusing you   In the old days  you could have thoughts and they would work themselves out  That is  you were not gay  bi  or trans because of your thinking at age 13  you were gay  bi  or trans because that's what you turned out to be   Your problem is you have the internet and that internet tells you every thought you have is normal  That is  the internet attaches a label on you before you are fully formed  before you actually "are"   What is normal for YOU is where you are going  You are not there yet  so leave the labels off as you explore  You are confused and rightly so  Ask you parents to get you into therapy so you can ask questions and be guided   Oh  and that therapy helps them as well so they can better support you As nowadays the infection related to the sexual

realise just how looks oriented this world is Well  we get recycled anyway  Just a bit slower I needed to read this  thank you for posting  I hope to find the same level of comfort and self reliance that you have for myself  This really put some things in perspective for me Lol  this stuff barely has an effect on me anymore  I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing   All of the things I like are male dominated Perhaps I misread the OP  but I'm pretty sure this is a female Congratulations    " I don't want to become alpha  ubermasculine  not sensitive  stoic  manly "  If this was truly the criteria for successfully dating then 99  of the human race would be alone I always have to laugh when someone suggests Tinder   I swipe until I'm out of likes multiple times week  Still haven't had a nonbot match since I reinstalled a couple of months ago   Edit  Today I got match on Bumble   An hour later it was gone  It must have been a mistake and she unmatched me How would you check for history with sex workers Sexual dysfunction is also known as sexual dissatisfaction or lack of interest in sex  However  the sexual dysfunction in women is very common as almost 40 percent of the women are affected because of this and most of them are young  The number of factors could be   Emotional stress  Feeling guilty about sex  Lack of self esteem  Fear of pregnancy   Vaginal infection  Intake of medicines etc  But to overcome these sexual dysfunction problems one can start with sexual activities like oral sex  massage or masturbation etc  Also  you can visualize sex so as to increase the sexual desire in women   In some cases  the sexual dysfunction in women is treated with the help of exercises or having the proper consultation with best sexologists  Maybe you should be the catcher in the rye so they don't fall It sucks  but it's honestly not worse than sitting at home  On a lot of days it is my only social interaction and sometimes I get lost in my work and forget about everything else for a while   People are almost all nice to me and I enjoy talking to a lot of them  The only thing that sucks is that nearly everyone is married engage  or in a long term relationship I will skip meals to avoid eating in front of people  Messy food  I hate messy food  If I could take a pill in leiu of physically eating  I would  Eating is a chore  I don't enjoy it  I often skip it  The way others eat  the noises  the physical process of eating    I understand it is required  And that is my definition of food  Required  Nothing more  nothing less   I completely understand what you've described  I honestly wish I didn't feel this way  It really does affect you socially  If you are in a store for example and some other customer is being rude to the clerk for no reason  you could defend the clerk by doing whatever you may like    I mean  my mother is working as a pharmacist assistant  basically she is the one selling meds at the counter  And if I were there when some jerk was being rude to her  you can imagine the outcome  DAfter watching the documentary about pedophillia in hollywood i cant see a child actor without wondering if he got molested for the part  Some creepy shit  Go advertise your cult elsewhere No  I'm not still living with them I'd happily boot someone in the face to protect those kids  I think they'll be okay  They have actual laws protecting child actors  there's been a huge turn around in people 'turning a blind eye' to this kind of thing    Don't panic OP  I think they'll be alright  The world is an unfair cesspool of maggots  human filth  Yeah well  the ones downvoting are uneducated  they don't know the facts  I used to be one of them  but because I do did my research  I found out that my former opinion was incorrect and didn't go along with research conducted by people much more intelligent than me  so I changed my opinion  I hope this guy gets the mental help he needs to ensure he doesn't go on to abuse any children  continuing the cycle of abuse Offer his parents a reasonable price for the weed Nahh i like being in the city forest and stuff arent kinda my thing haha and yea i have always wondered   What i need to do with my life and i still havent figured it out    and im 21 years old btwThis is what I was trying to say  but you're way more eloquent  I think it's now not such a hushed up thing  and there's advocates and that kind of thing    I seriously think these kids are pretty cool  I was honestly surprised at how level headed they all seem  But still very much  just kids  Welcome to the club man  we understand your pain   I tried to enjoy them and honestly I don't enjoy the things you do at a club  no limiting belief  just a preference Hi   My oldest daughter just turned nineteen  attends a top tier university and  most importantly  in her own words is relatively happy and well adjusted   This is the only reason I feel remotely qualified to respond to your post   I'm very proud of you for trying to find someone to talk to   This was huge and you deserve to give yourself a big pat on the back   And further applause for finding Reddit   There are so many people on Reddit that you won't have any problem finding people who share your opinions and or are able to provide the words you need to help you move forward in your life   But with that vast pool of users comes some bad  too   When I was a kid I had this irrational belief that all old people had their shit together and were kind   They were all sweet grandmotherly types who cared deeply about us and our worlds   Of course this was a pile of excrement   When we're young though we have naive beliefs which make us vulnerable   There are a lot of sick fucks out there   poison and razor blades in Halloween candy for example   so while it truly is great that you have opened up on Reddit  don't let people's responses get under your skin if you don't want them to   As Reddit's userbase is massive there are all kinds of other Redditors who share your opinions on anything   Focus on where you want to be  not where you are right now   This will prevent you from merely wallowing in unhappiness and instead will assist in planning a route to where you want to be   Unless you're in danger of being physically or mentally abused there  I strongly urge you to stay in school   In today's society you need all the schooling you can get and if it's free  take it   Further  school provides structure  a purpose to get out of bed and you can find some of your friends there   Lastly  you will start losing career options if you leave school and I assure you that you want to have as many of those possible   And while obtaining some motivation  guidance and support from Reddit is great  getting this kind of stuff from someone in a face to face relationship can be far better   The statistical odds are such that it's impossible for there to not be any cool people at your school     Everyone goes through a horrible phase in their teen years and you are not any different   Growing into adulthood is a painful process and it's really great that you have identified some of what's going on with you and that you want to change it   The best idea to hang on to is that things WILL GET BETTER     I promise   There's always a light at the end of the tunnel    Good luck  hang in there  and all the best for 2017 Whether youre 15 or 50  you can get the perfect smile at any age  Come in for a consultation and let us make your teeth healthy and straight in just 6 months  https   www

than the classic "to err is to human" and perfection being impossible  another reason why it's impossible is that your priorities will change as you grow  When your priorities change the direction your compass points changes as well   All of this is perfectly fine  as long as you are following the path of your compass during your current phase of life  Knowing my luck  If I was Gay   tried taking one up the back passage  The banana would turn out to be straight       Must admit though  Banana skins have their lubing uses LOLI'm not sure if it's a date but I did went to the movies with this girl I knew and we also  had  mutual feelings  Although I did screw it up way after we went to the movies with my lack of social skills and I think she hates me now  At least I did do something that was out of my comfort zone but I still feel like shit  I'm 17 18 and that was my first time ever asking her to go out There's a view of the world we want to live in     Then there's the real world     You will look back later on in life and remember how much of what I said was true      I assume your parents were very liberal and brought you up to be a super soft kid   You try to talk to your doctor about mental health issues  which you have no idea what real mental issues are   Social anxiety is something we all have  and we all have to get past it   I guess you can stay stuck with it until you hit 40 and realize you wasted all your years loathing around complaining   C ya Look up Polyamory  i get the feeling it might suit you hunWell you can try being honest with him and just tell him how you feel maybe get a dual membership to a gym  Tell him how you feel if you dont eventually its going to come out in a bad way  You cant just supress things youre thinking eventually they do come out whether u mean them to or not  It might take years but one day youll slip up and that will hurt him a lot worse than you being honest about it now  Its just weight and you do love him if he knows its bothering you hell try to lose it  Simple as that  Also i can tell you from personal experience im a skinny guy i used to could eat whatever i wanted btu once i hit thirty my metabolism slowed to a crawl and its really hard to lose weight so you need to do it now while youre young as opposed to waiting  Hope this helps  Dont be afraid to be honest in your relationship  holding things back might seem okay but in the long run it causes issues you might not even imagine until youre in that sittuation I don't know bruh  you just encountered the most dangerous species of women   If I were you  I'd simply tell her that now after saying all those things to each other you cannot stay "just friends" anymore  Tell her that if she really likes you  then she shall make up her mind   Also you should let her know that the boy in question from her home state probably fucked way too many other girls already     Also  what does she mean by "getting her life together" and "being independent"  To me it sounds like "I don't want you in my life and I don't want a relationship  I simply want you in the friendzone  because I am so fucking selfish"     Dude  if you can't say those things to her  better stop seeing her at  all  You are doing nothing but hurting yourself  You don't deserve to get hurt so bad  There are plenty of girls out there  channel your energy on someone who is worth it   Hope it helped  waiting for an update I know it's a normal response  I think about it and I feel a combination of anger and sadness  But I have been physically unable to cry  Which is completely out of the ordinary for me because I am very emotional and suffer from anxiety  I normally cry easily  But I can't  I think part of me is scared to start crying because then I won't be able to stop  I feel so much anger towards him right now  Anger that I have never felt before  He left me at a really vulnerable time during my life  I was raped towards the end of the summer  Guess I was too broken for him  We also live together  back in our college town  so now when we go back I have to deal with all of that  I should be bawling  but I haven't been able to  He's British If topical

https   www drvanas com contact us  Thank you  I hope I can cry soon  It is so frustrating that people can get away with this   I know what you mean about a hassle  I went through something very similar  contacted the council  my landlord and the police and I was amazed that nobody could do anything about it or just flat out ignored my problem  hence I lost the opportunity for an important job interview and lots of travel costs from being kept up until 6 in the morning  and nothing has come of it to this day    At this rate I'm considering fighting fire with fire like you haha  yeah you'll mostly find that authorities don't give a damn about breach of peace  and what's really insane to me is that if I just hinted that they had a bit of weed or something then they'd probably send round a fucking swat team  It's all broken  but I think you may have a stronger case than me if the problem is ongoing and not sporadic  good luckThat's very true  and it's what I keep thinking  It's just never seemed like a good time to bring it up  yknow  Early dating  obviously not  and then after that it seems like there's always something stressful that happens right when I was gonna bring it up and I don't want to pile THIS on top too   I guess there's never gonna be a "good" time  though  I hope he doesn't think I've been dishonest with him until now  I do truly enjoy him and our time in bed  It just gets weird when he sends me a nude and I have to figure out a response that's honest  yet sexy  yet dances around what I'm thinking   PDefinitely i think in this case  you should get a professional opinion and probably talk to an MD or a OBGYN and get checked that theres not some physical issue going on and then if theres not then possibly talk to a psychiatrist to discover if theres some mental cause for this pain it could be either or not knowing more about the situation  The main thing to remember is if youre feeling pain its important to find out why  Its nothing to be ashamed of but please go get checked out to make sure youre okay because it could be an indicator of more severe issues  Im not doctor but but pain whether physical or mental is an indicator theres an issue and its the mind and bodys way of preventing harm whether real or imagined so please go see a doctor  Like i say its nothing to be ashamed of but if you ignore it  it might cause further issues down the line    http   www ourbodiesourselves org health info pain during intercourse or penetration haha fair enough  Was just asking because a few days ago I was at a shop and the lady infront of me wasn't really nice  She wasn't like rude or screaming but like answering everything with one word or being demeaning to the girl with the way she said things  I was just wondering how I could have handled the situation the best Nope never a good time  just jump in and tell him  just make sure he knows you do love him and youre not being mean youre just being honest about your feelings  It might bother him a little bit but thats okay hell get through it and maybe even be thankful youre honest with him you dont know unless you tell him  Honestys always best  I been married 18 years trust me it makes a huge difference I understand  however you've got to understand that you're not becoming a bad person you're removing barriers that prevent your influence on your world  Do you really wish to bottle up your actions  perhaps they need voiced to someone you trust  the therapeutic model  You seek forgiveness on things you've been unwilling to let go of  If you've forgiven yourself there wouldn't be anything to talk about  Don't let anything eat you up  connect with someone who can be a reciprocal for your intimate feelings  to absolve any fears Or you can entertain the possibility and voice your feelings because that's what you truly want Honestly I'd rather have a good job and no partner than a shitty job and a partner The good news is that you've already made it past most of the disadvantages one would encounter in the projects  With guns  drugs  and the violent lifestyle that accompanies these low income areas  it's very easy to get absorbed in that world and drop out of school  But you didn't  You persevered  graduated  and now you're basically one more step away from leaving the projects   The last thing you need to do is what everyone needs to do  get a job and move out  It doesn't matter if it's a shitty job  just find something that will give you some income  Save up as much as you can  then find a place to live  Starting out I would recommend looking for someplace with a roommate  Your biggest cost of living is going to be rent and utilities  so when that can get split by 2 or more people it makes it much more affordable for someone just starting out   Getting away from the projects is probably the  1 goal you should have now  It's just not safe and you're subject to a lot of distractions  Get a job and move out  then see where you're at    After you've stabilized your own life in your own place  then go to your closest community college  at least that's what we call them in the states  not sure if the term translates 100    Provided you graduated high school  you can start taking courses at a community college for much cheaper than a university  To figure out how to pay for it  meet with someone from the financial aid office  To see what courses to take  they should have guidance counselors to help you get to your goal   Now  that's the more traditional route  Lots of pilots also get their start in the military  This could be a good option for you since the military can provide food and housing for you while you're enlisted and then you can get help from them to go to college too  The military might be a preferable choice since you can immediately get out of the projects and get sent to basic training  You'll get paid  have everything provided for you  advance towards being a pilot  and advance towards a college degree   Here's a website that talks through the basic steps of what it should take  http   study com become a pilot html  Congratulations on graduating  People take it for granted  but it's especially a good accomplishment when someone comes from the projects It's that initial step that counts  Many never get to this point   By the way  I highly recommend Tinder or any form of online dating to people who are looking to get back out their and slowly gain momentum    The negative stigma of online dating has disappeared and now everyone is on it  I hope you have a wonderful year as well  DWell Dan

Health  if you have any questions or concerns  How are you single   You seem like a real catch Before they have a chance to know and accept a real 'you'  they will need to go through a checklist of socially expected validated things about you  Having no relationship experience after 30 is definitely not in this list and usually gets you dumped long before your personality has a chance to shine You should probably talk about all this to your partner  Because as of such you haven't provided much details in your post  So none of us really know what's up  Talk to your partner and try and express yourself to her  Maybe she could help you out better    Plus dont think that you will be worrying her  She will only be happier if you both are happy together and that will happen if you are happy by yourself  All the best    Well he doesnt want me to give him money  but i know he needs gas money to get back and forth to work  Its only  20  30 at a time  Hes had a bad experience moving

commute  Until mid last year  I was commuting an hour each way to work  and one day realized that I was spending 10 hours a week just driving to and from my job  That is two hours per day of my life that I could be using for more practical things  So  I moved closer to work  Now my commute is a 15 minute drive  I don't have to get up nearly as early  and I get a lot more sleep   and then when I get home in the evening  I still have time to do other things   Friends are important  but there are ways that you can still stay in contact with them  I think the practicality of being close to school outweighs the need to be close to your friends  It's going to be so much easier on you  your family  and your sanity    I hope this helps  and you'll be in my thoughts and prayers today What's happened since now and last year  No one heard from him at all for almost a year  I've been online gaming forever and as a female I've had a ton of verbal abuse ranging from the mild "girls shouldn't play games" or "shouldn't you be doing your make up" to severe name calling where I've been called every bad name you can imagine and people telling me to stop playing because they hate me so much  It used to bother me but I know that's exactly what they want so I used pretend that it didn't bother me and say "is that all you've got to throw at me  "  Now I've heard so much I'm used to it  I'm not saying you'll get used to it and I'm not saying what people say online is acceptable by any means    Over the years everytime it happens I've realised these people mean nothing to me so their opinion of me as a girl or a gamer doesn't matter and therfore I refuse to let it hurt me  Yes it's hurtful when people say horrible stuff to us but you already know that you are a good and nice person  you said it yourself so why let some throw away comment from a random person hurt you  It's not easy to push this out of your mind but you have to because right now it's not helping you at all is it    If you want to delete or block the extreme ones then do it  protect yourself a little but the best thing is to remember these people are not your real friends  they are just people they don't mean anything therefore anything they say doesn't matter  You are stronger than you think  please don't let this get to you  Why again when you hate it I actually like my job  I drive 400 miles a night by myself  I essentially get paid to listen to music and podcasts  It's quite frankly a perfect job for me and it's going to allow me to finally move out in a few months It sounds like you're saying she's going through a difficult time  but the major concern is your confidence and self esteem  I don't know this woman  but I am one  And if my mother just had a stroke  I would probably start to fall apart  My advice to you  if you care about this woman as a lifemate and not as your personal boost  be there for her as much as possible  Be someone she can lean on  not someone she has to carry  You don't have to force yourself into the situation if you aren't welcomed  but you can let her know that if there is anything to be done  you are the man to get it done    If it is over though  congrats  You're feeling everything a person feels in a breakup  Time time time  It passes  Not very profound  but true nonetheless  Good luck  throwaway account man   Thank you so much for your comment  it is very helpful and I'll be thinking about this as I make my final decision    Also I'm not self concious about myself  I don't think I'm ugly or anything but I still feel like I won't be

Fuck  OffEveryone is repulsed by me  not just kids Half of it sounds like from some teen targeted rom com  up to the oh so cute tiny details    I don't get the hype for self pity porn like that  it

Marketers love every one of them My first crushes probably don't even remember me Did you try it with rice since she just had a bad attitude I don't think there's anything you could have done besides

using them  Remember that your relationship with the company you work for is a business relationship  and this is part of the business agreement you made with them  It's that simple  Society wants you

no trouble regularly getting sex  of course it's not a big deal  The nerve of these people  Had to login to comment  I thought I was the only one but it seems my predictions appear a lot less than yours  Mine are quite rare  but regardless I can tell you I can feel the future events somehow  But these events would only happen recently as such in a span of one month max  It seems human conciousness has some way to do this  Actually  in my opinion think the responsibility lies on brain being capable of caltulating the future somehow through maths  Are you good at math  Of course not  I've survived so far by primarily goodwill and charity  however human nature is complicayed  and businesses exist to earn a profit for someone  Even nonprofits must look at cost affectiveness  and while I have learned many coping skills since  it was not so long ago I was turned away both as a volunteer  and as a self employed seller of my own goods at a local market  Both times it wasn't because my work or goods was unsatisfactory  but because some person was afraid of how others would perceive me  or how I might affect others  If I can't volunteer  I find it hard to believe I'd be hired    You spend a lot of time in your story blaming your father's girlfriend for his behavior  He is an adult  and he 100  put himself in the situation and made these choices  Your father is putting people's lives at risk  Please call the police on him and make sure he doesn't do this again I had a similar situation with my own father at 16  I told my mother and she didn't believe me after speaking with my dad  It was very painful  For a year or two my own father basically disowned me and wouldn't speak to me and my mother  who I believe was too in shock to cope with the truth  would even call me names  She accused me of just saying that to ruin my dad's career  She couldn't understand why I wouldn't take him to jail over it   He only physically touched me once  most of his abuse was trying to bribe me like "I'll let you do whatever you want in exchange for this sexual favor "  and still he was my father and I had two brothers 14 and 9 who I felt responsible not to ruin their lives either    It's been 10 years since all of that and I've learned to cope with the fact that my family may have never acknowledged what happened  I learned to forgive them anyway and understand they were just too weak to cope with the truth of what happened  Personally  I would try to bring it all out in the air because they are your family and who better to talk to than them but just KNOW if they still can't cope  they may be in shock from it  Nobody wants to believe their son husband relative is a pedophile  especially and incestual one    There's a book that helped me cope with all of this because instead of my family isolating my father  they isolated me  My brothers eventually found out and just being young boys they would also mock me and call me a bitch and a brat etc  it was very hard  The book is called "Anatomy of the Spirit"  It helped me heal some of my emotional issues I had held on to for too long  It doesn't deal only specifically to this issue  It talks about all physical and emotional issues  Anyway  hope that helps    TLDR  This behavior from them is common  Just know in the end you can only control yourself  Work towards accepting reality which is they may never acknowledge what happened  They're not bad people for that  per se  just in shock    This  Close Thread  Sam  drop the mic  There are many apps and sites that will show you where sex offenders live in the US   The wife and I use Life360 not specifically for this but you can flick on an option to see sex offenders on that for example What you're feeling is okay  You just have to find ways to create a healthy outlet for yourself  Get yourself into the local BDSM scene and find ways to do this that are healthy  happy  and consensual  And get into therapy Are you high I am tallish  pretty average looking  I hope  and awkward  so I'll have to go with the last one This guy gets it I would love to be able to  but the age gap is a massive issue  Normally I don't care about age gaps  providing all is legal  but somehow this one is a factor Yes I agree  Voice your feelings before it's too late  I was in this situation  I think I lost my chances I meant like activity clubs  Like hiking  camping  book clubs  rowing  games  the are clubs and meetups for everything Get an amazon fire thing   Pretty nifty and does all of that  I thought it was an app for sex offenders to find each other and get their nasty on I see  Unfortunately out of those I only like games  and that didn't work out despite my attempts  Should I pretend to care and join then I'm thinking about making myself eat an apple before I pig out on other foods call a local vet and describe what's going on  he she will have information about your options   Take responsibility for your dog where your parents can't  you can advocate for the dog Put in some laps  When you're driving I'm assuming you feel better than the rest of the time you're alive  so when you feel down or feel like you're loosing yourself just take a drive and find that 'happy' place behind the wheel  It helps me a lot  Track days are the shit   They just can't accept that Trump is superior and they just shit talk him all day when he shows up on TV and I feel judged because of that and it makes me really sad   There's your problem  Don't feel like that  People are entitled to their personal opinions without having to fear what others think and feel about them    I think that's one of the things Trump is trying to make a point out of  really  There's a word for the talent you're describing  Apathy    In my experience  apathy frees me while empathy is like an Achilles's heel  it'll destroy you    Apathy FTW  that will show her  talking behind her back  p but yeah you're probably right  Just though there was something I could do I'm so torn this time  I like her as a person too  and I don't want to mess that up  But I can't help how I feel  I'm scared that with the age gap people will think I'm taking advantage or something  Which I would never do   I also know that she has no intention of being in a relationship  and I get her reasons why there's more to relationships than looks   She's probably used to relationships with real jerks who only want her because of her looks  but in your responses you treat her like a person   don't undervalue yourself or what she needs expects from a relationship   You've learned a lot in your life as an observer and that makes you interesting   She's probably felt alone and uninteresting herself  if every other guy thinks she's out of his league or really isn't interested in her personally Sounds like you're equating drugs with screwing up  Does that apply to people on prescription meds  or is a guy smoking a spliff a total screw up  Say it was not you and stick to that story  Photos get photoshopped and leaked all the time  Just say it was not you  Don't forget to lift another shower while in the shower while being  confident   otherwise it will all be for naught Sit down in a quiet place free from distraction  Set a timer for 20 minutes  For that 20 minutes  study  read  go over flash cards  re write notes  whatever you need to do  When the timer goes off  walk away for 5 minutes and do something else  After that 5 minutes is over  do another 20 minutes of studying  Continue this cycle for however long is necessary  Once you're finished  do something you enjoy  Play video games  watch a movie  go for a run  etc  I used to think that the pains I had at a young age  were normal for people  I have migraines  sometimes a searing pain in my head  like someone burnt a very specific part of my brain  I got diagnosed with MS when I was 22   I get extremely tired after a routine exercise  Running can be exhausting for me  and yet I want it  I constantly have cuts on my hands  and sometimes legs  and they talk a lot of time to heal   over a span of weeks   I look really old  for my age  28    I am still glad the MS hasn't taken over  Just going through life as best as I can Maybe get some flood lights that point directly at their bedroom windowwell  he's not superior  but you're free to think he is   Tell them you feel invalidated when they disagree with you or tell them you need to excuse yourself if when you feel overwhelmed I think you will at least feel better about your body Tell them that he's in first grade and it's not a big deal  Also  tell them both to each go and eat 1 entire bag of dicks  It's okay  The first few years were not that great  I was the "weird one"  rarely got invited to group dinners parties  If I was invited  it was from this couple who took pity on me   Now I am as distant as I can be in my group  Just do my work and head back to my room  There is nothing much to ask for  really I hear Fed Up is pretty good too  No  you are not fucked  unfortunately I would just say sorry  we've told him not to write on other people's property  And leave it at that    If they question it beyond that  tell them the kids are 6 years old and shit happens  And they should really let it go Kids are hard to deal with for many people  hanging out with adults can be much more relaxing  or the right adults for you    It's ok to not worship children or not handle them well  they can be draining   Some people are energized by them  some handle them  but you need to take care of yourself when you feel overwhelmed by them  As for saving money  try not spending it in the first place  and by that I mean get creative about how you spend your money   Pick up furnishings for free or super cheap if you can  see if you qualify for reduced cost services  do your research   Asking for help from others is the right way to go  you're not alone trying to handle situations at home Have you tried Skyrim yet  I love it and I also loved Oblivion and Morrowind I'm a 21 year old second year university student in England  I'll go through your points and try give you as much info as I can    From your question  yes it's worth going to uni  we have older students on our course and I know many other people at different uni's who are in the same boat    Bare in mind firstly that essays   assignments can get boring and difficult  that you'll need to do extra curricular stuff to get the full experience and stand out for the crowd if youre applying to a 'graduate job'    Different Universities have different entry requirements  so there may be one that accepts that qualification  all depends on what you're studying  they may consider your work experience if your going into an IT course for example  but if you're planning in doing something different I wouldn't think so    Have a look at UCAS  Google it  work out how many UCAS points your qualification is worth  calculator on the website    UCAS is the website that you apply for uni for  I personally did A levels to get into Uni  so you may have to do one A level or something at a community college to get in  if your BTEC isn't enough    Students loans in this country are only payed back after you're on 21k a year and I can't remember the exact percentage but it's quite small  You have a tution fee loan which is 9k a year and then a maintenance loan which is anywhere for 3 10k a year  to help with living costs    You've either got to decide to commute from whether you're living at the moment or live in student accommodation  or find somewhere privately near your Uni of choice  Student 'halls' are normally very party orientated  Obviously up to you what you want to do on that front    Uni is what you make of it  but will almost certainly help you in later life  I'm 32 and wouldn't even want to meet talk to a 18 year old  Or fallout 3   4  Oblivion and Skyrim with guns Sure  would be appreciatedObviously dont bring it up  but also dont lie about itTL DR  Be well rounded   Make a change to break out of your rut   Find motivation   Profit    Not sure if I can really answer this  but I can tell you my experience so far   I'm in my early forties and in the US  just to provide some context   I was always fairly smart  fairly creative  and generally OK at just about everything I tried   But I was never great at anything growing up and was always overshadowed by my peers   So I kept trying new things in an attempt to find my thing     I tried art  musical instruments  martial arts  computers  cars   Was still never the best at any of it   This was very frustrating because I was always told that everyone had a talent  so I just had to find mine     As I entered adulthood I was generally pretty successful   I began to stand out among my peers and I wasn't really sure why   I was surrounded by smart  motivated people but for some reason  I got the attention of my leaders     Well  it turns out that by trying all those things  I became well rounded and had a lot of diverse skills   This apparently allowed me to adapt to changing situations and apply different skills in a lot of different tasks   So  I got shit done and was able to support other people because I didn't just have one narrow focus   I would say I'm still not the "best" at any one thing  but as a result of my experimenting with so many things  I have a pretty useful set of skills and experience   And remember  I didn't set out with a goal to become a Jack of all trades   Now  having said that  the more I have accomplished  the more insecure I have become about my place in the world   It is full blown Impostor Syndrome  look it up if you aren't familiar   and intellectually I recognize that   But I still sometimes feel like a huge faker   I mean how could I  who am never the best at anything  have the career and life that I do   There are so many things I could be better at   And it's not perfect   I recently got divorced  so obviously I don't have that aspect of my life nailed down yet   So  applying this to your post   You speak Russian to some degree   You are an artist to some degree   You have morals that are important to you and motivate you toward a career   I'm assuming you aren't homeless and unemployed  so you seem capable of supporting yourself   You recognize that you should be more physically fit  which makes me think you used to be more so   You sound like a pretty well rounded person who just needs to find a little motivation   And maybe you need some sort of catalyst to shake up your life a bit   Maybe you should start looking for that job that fits your morals  regardless of where it is located   A move to a new place and a new job could be the kick in the ass you need to break out of this rut     Maybe you should join a CrossFit gym and commit to doing it for at least three months   Make a friend hold you accountable    Maybe place a wager on your attendance   Or join a cycling club   Or an art club   The point is  make a change in one area and you may find that it will spur you to change other things   Or maybe you will realize that Russian just isn't that important to you   Or that you like having a beer gut     Tell me those are just refelction of the glowing computer screen  Good advice  Thanks very much for the reply   Being a Female and trying to play a game online must be at least 10 times worse than being a dude  in terms of verbal abuse and unwanted attention  I don't even get on the mic anymore  although that doesn't mean people still can't yell at me over voice chat      It's just a different medium for people to insult me on  Although voice abuse is worse than text since it humanizes the person more  instead of being the anonymous troll behind a keyboard  they now have a voice  too  So I guess staying off voice chat is one way to go   but that's also part of gaming  using voice to strategize against the enemy  So I don't know   don't want to let these people ruin the games for you  but they have so many ways to ruin things  Argh  it's so hard to enjoy things in life with a holes everywhere  It seems like it quickly comes to a point where it's just easier not to play games  Shouldn't let jerks dissuade me from enjoying my leisure time  but it seems like that's just how it is  Maybe it is easier just to stop playing these games and having to interact with these horrible people  Of course  a lot of people just game and don't say shit  or are respectful and good sports   and are fun to play with  It only takes one turd to ruin it  though    Here's a similar thread on reddit  https   www reddit com r SeriousConversation comments 4nz16a how do you deal with online strangers who bully   from a while back you may find helpful  too Isn't it strange  We go about our day  go out to buy groceries  maybe some go to work  and perform as an apparently functioning member of society  But we are carrying all the depression  all the negative thoughts with us  all that time  And no one cares  It's so alienating  When we try to feel  the only feeling available to us is sadness  Apathy is the only defence against it Find someone to talk to     Your school should have counseling services  Talk to them  don't try to go thru this alone and stuck inside your own head  My family saw me like this for years until they all left the religion  one by one  Although I missed having a connection with my family during that time  I knew how happy I felt and that it was the one thing they couldn't take away from me I work early in the morning to early in the afternoon  Me and one other guy and we usally make breakfast for eachother or lunch  The only people I talk to are for taking invoices from the delivery vehicles  so it's very nice  Or maybe they don't realize it's in every goddamn thing they eat including flour  Maybe it has something to do with big sugar buying science that states it doesn't contribute to diabetes or obesity  Maybe it has to do with big sugar buying government insiders to have thier product declared safe by the FDA  Maybe it has something to do with the massive subsidies we pump into sugar so a pound costs  2 and a head of cauliflower cost  5   Passing this off as a problem of pure consumer apathy is really ignorant  Sugar marketers must love you Do you have any close friends that are girls  Maybe have them help "train" you  Like condition you to stop looking with a light kick to the shins every time you

dick   hand would be too raw  you have to alternate between masturbating  netflix  videogames  eating  napping  etc  What would be some tips you would give in order to have a good first date   I'm definitely not the right person to ask  but most of it is common sense  Be polite  be interested in her and what she says  and try do build a conversation around the answers she gives you  It sounds like you've already made a pretty good connection with her  so at this point I think it mostly comes down to personal chemistry once you actually meet  I hope it turns out well for you too    Keep trying  Rejection is an unfortunate but normal part of the job hunting process   As for your shoplifting record  if you know they will be doing a background check  try being proactive about it  Mention it in the interview  explain what happened and what you've done about it since  and why you feel that incident doesn't define you    If they're going to find out anyway  best to tackle it head

org   It's a volunteer organization   You can drop in on support groups for free and if you contact them they'll put you in touch with counselors in your area who can help out   What helps me is thinking about topics I like or opinions I have about something and thinking through what I would really tell someone  Do my research  adjust it based on facts  and think about what I would really want to say to someone  That way when that time rolls around I am not stuck stuttering and I also have my facts straight    Why rice Go on   Why not go all the way and try to check out at 35  Reproduce put some todlers on this earth and blow your vmbrains out  Terribly effective  no hassle and good for the environment God gave doctors wonderful minds to develop treatments for disease  It would be a waste of their God given talents to not make use of them The population size of nations such as India and China says otherwiseOf course  I understand how that can be really upsettingYup plant based diets with sufficient omega 3 and B12 are the best diets known to science  Exact life expectancies cannot yet be calculated because such diets only recently became available but similar groups like traditional Okinawans and Californian Adventists live well past their 90s  At least I did do something that was out of my comfort zone but I still feel like shit   Just hang in there  Some day you'll look back at this and realize that it meant absolutely nothing  It's all part of growing up  You try new things  you screw up  and you learn something  The fact that you're actually trying is what's important and more than I had the courage to do at your age     I think she hates me now   Unless you did something insane  I doubt she even remembers it  There's just one way to find out That was surprisingly lighthearted and positive  Take it down REEEEEEI feel like that wouldn't work out very well   I could be wrong  There are benifits to buying a dog and benifits to rescuing a dog   If you plan to buy a dog  do research on that breeds temperment  Regardless do research on dogs in general like body language and training    It's a huge investment in both money and time to care for the little buggers Oh I'm confident  but I really don't like going out just because I've tried everything and would rather sit inside reading or playing games  Also work  Damn  this is fucking triggering  It's just wonderful being FA  Being ugly is the biggest All you yall can have my sugar  LEAVE MY BEEF ALONE    I don't care if it's a walking farting greenhouse machine  keep messing with my steaks and I swears to all that is holy we will have riots and mayhem in the streets  If you cared for people then you would care for what they have to say  So that's the problem  there is nobody you care for  You're probably surrounded by acquaintances  associates  or colleagues  No  actual  friends    Seeing as the problem seems to be getting your foot in the door  evaluate your likes and interests and see if you can meet someone with the same commonalities as you  You're more inclined to put in the effort with someone you find interesting  Once the ice is broken and you feel comfortable around them it will become a friendship   The beautiful thing about friendship is that you become so comfortable around them that it doesn't even feel like you're listening to them  Ah shit  look at that  guess i just read right past thatRemember the "half your age   7" ruleI would say she's blocked you in FB but is avoiding adding you  Snapchat no  I stop talking with her  you are wasting your time if she's being the way she's being That's my speculation but I do plan on asking her friends to know what she really thinks of me since I did try to ask her but she never gave a straight answer  If she really does hates me and wants to avoid me it's fine and I'll respect her wishes   Thanks for the encouragement and advice man  Hope you're doing well yourself This is intended to be helpful and not offensive     you have a personality issue that needs to be addressed  It might be an autism spectrum disorder or ADHD or something else  There are behaviors you are exhibiting that people don't like  I can't tell you what they are because I haven't been around you  My best advice is to go up to the people who rejected you and ask them what it is that they don't like about you and go from there  Warning  You must ask in a polite way or this WILL backfire  If you need help drafting what to say  I will write something for you copy and paste  My immune system seems to be quite good  I usually avoid clods and flues  there was a vomitting bug going around my region recently  I didn't get it  I encountered quite a few people who had it and I didn't catch it  I went for about 3 years without getting a cold at one point   Well I don't know why age is an issue  Perhaps contemplate that   What if it's not for her  what if she prefers older men She doesn't want to talk to you anymore    Stop harassing stalking her Pull up a chair darlin  we're going for a ride  Your sadness is a measure of your love for her She decided it's too late for you two to have something romantic   Move on   You need to start pulling the trigger on these girls and asking them out instead of having them on your mind whatever that means Stay away  He is going to manipulate youWhat kind of university limits internet access  Well the good news is that it's not too late  If you go to a community college  not sure exactly where you are but the suburbs of Philly have plenty of great ones  and keep your grades up  you can definitely reapply in a year or two  Save some money while you can  and you'll come out with the same degree  but less student loans to pay back  It seems horrible now  but this will be a  huge  consolation when you're a little older and trying to get your own place and find a "real" job after college  I think it could be that she is still at school  Shes of legal age   and I'm more than 10 years older  I know she has a thing for older men  but Ive not heard her mention anything about 22 23 Right  that's the plan  I wouldn't be comfortable lying to someone about it  but I'm definitely not bringing it up If you don't want him  then just say no  You're going to hurt his feeling if you are too nice to him and downplaying yourself this early in life is not healthy for you    Just because he has autism and probaly has been the only boy interested in you doesn't mean it is only special people who are attracted to you  Literally any guy here would wish upon a star if you were in their area and age group    You are looking for someone who is smart i presume  Then look in online places  Most guys who are smart are also introverted and will open up if they find someone they like  I think you may be looking in the wrong places if you're using Tinder or someother mainstream app  I think your Mom and brother going to fight  And it's going to be bad  I would be aware of this  Best of luck OPPrediction  He's gonna pressure and manipulate you hard to have sex with him and since he's 50 and has propably done this to a lot of teenagers he'll most likely get his way  You're gonna feel like shit afterwards and it's gonna haunt you for years but you'll be too embarassed to go to the cops since you "technically agreed" Thanks for sharing your experience   You did the right thing   There is no reason to wallow in your sorrow   Let this be an example to all the virgin FA's I just like to say darlin  Is there anyway we can just move the fuck on from that  Jesus H  Christ in heaven  some of ya'll are some petty little titty babies  We have REAL fuckin issues going on and some of ya'll are throwing a hissy fit over darlin  It's going to kick off considerably  don't know if there's something I should do to soften the blow or whether I should be the one to tell her      Thanks for your well wishes  That's huge man   Way to go  Fake it  Till you make it Politicians have no choice but to be corrupt due to issues of funding Let me tell you that your post resonated a lot with me  I'm in a similar situation regarding what comes next and "what ifs " We haven't kissed yet  though I feel like we're both waiting for the other to make a move    I definitely feel like it might put a damper on things if I were outright about the whole situation so I'll keep things vage  Other than that I feel we're pretty well matched so I'm hoping for the best  Good luck to you Do you think people understood just how bad it is  I grew up thinking that sugar was better than fat  I remember eating low fat deserts  crackers and cookies  thinking I was being healthy  I thought that sugar would maybe make me gain weight    I had no idea the list of negative outcomes sugar was related to  until I started researching health and nutrition  I think its a great write up of how good sex can be personally and don't see why it would be downvoted Maybe try advertising on a website like fivver  and see if being paid helps you feel motivated   Or you could just simply leave it be  being good at something is not meant to be a burden  and who knows later in life you may come back to it   Do what is right for you It's all a bunch of bullshit  These people act like you need to be a self actualized and enlightened before you can consider being in a relationship  yet forget that tons of emotionally immature teenagers are getting into relationships everyday  There are people who love themselves so little that they are constantly jumping from one relationship to the next because they are scared to be alone   "Don't try too hard  It'll happen when you're not even looking "  "You have to make an effort  You have to work on improving yourself  You have to approach people and talk to them "Thanks for giving me advice from "the other side"  I will indeed apologize if I see her again    Apparemtly the new Legend of Zelda game is like Skyrim but better  I haven't played Oblivion so forgive me Man buns     just no I was wondering for how long did you stop jacking off before that day   Thanks for the story  it made my day   If someones cheats on someone that they 'love'  then they'll do it to another person that they 'love'  That's just my philosophy though  might not be true for everyone but generally that's how it works out in my eyes The only other people I've seen who write like you do have a schizophrenia diagnosis  I'm just saying  If you're a person with an obvious and untreated mental illness  it's not surprising that others react to you the way you describe  It's really hard and frustrating to relapse like that  but there's nothing wrong with going back on antidepressants if they help you  I used to do this a lot  where I'd stop my antidepressants when I felt better  then feel worse and have to go back on them  It was hard for me to accept that this is a chronic illness I'll be dealing with my whole life  My depression has been so much easier to manage now that I'm always on them  I hope that  if you and your doctor decide that medication is best  you feel better soon and become the poster girl for recovery with a little help from science  Let them fuck each other and leave other people alone  I am looking into government grant to cover the costs of producing this vital service Really depends on how close you are to your family  If you're close then probably they won't disown you  But still insist you chance your ways  I dunno  That's just my opinion  Good luck  As not moses said  giving yourself partial doses will help to alleviate some of the withdrawl effects  They'll like still be there  but they'll be more managable  and you'll avoid the worst of it   Honestly  and speaking  only  from personal experience  smoking weed helped a lot for me  A lot of the side effects I got were at night  and often came with a heaping amount of anxiety  even when I knew what was happening    I know that's probably not the most recommended way to deal  but it worked pretty well for me  I hope you feel better soon Have you had anyone  and I mean ANYONE  significant in your life since 2006  I understand we fall really hard for people and some even haunt us for years on end  but most of the time it lingers because there's no one else in the picture  The woman you're fixated on  while probably lovely  seems like a case of infatuation gone too far    The best way to try and move on is to replace her  Good on you for managing how you feel and such to not be creepy  now take another step forward and find someone worth dating that isn't from 10 years ago  To me  it seems like you have blinders up and regret that you guys didn't work out  That she was the best you could do and is a constant reminder of your loneliness and failure in love  Move forward  mingle  get out there and find someone to take her place  I'm self employed  so if I didn't like it  I'd have to yell at my boss to make things better hahah  when I feel that myself I swoon at my crush They're a lot tougher and more comfortable I think if you learned from the experience  it was worth having   Long distance relationships are hard  I think cutting ties might be a good option if only for keeping your sanity  It would also force you to move on and grow from the situation instead of getting mired in the "what ifs" and sutff like that Yes  the police Personally I do not flush the toilet at night sometimes when I pee to avoid waking anyone who is sleeping in a room that is close to the bathroom   I see nothing wrong with flushing it after I pee when I wake up   I do also work at 5am so I'm always the first up   Second  I bet people didn't know that they were using your toiletries   The host provided brand name stuff and yours probably was too   Unless you have told people what stuff is yours how are they to know   Get a basket or something to keep the your products in and keep it in your room  that's what I did when my laundry detergent was emptying quicker than it should   That's all I got  the other points are entirely valid Buy an old iPhone or similar   Heaps on eBayI wonder if that's because they weren't really part of the Hollywood scene  the Potter movies were all filmed in the UK  I think Thank you for your kindness and helpful tools  I'm sorry I am just now replying to your comment  it got buried in the hundreds I have received over the past 24 hours  I hope you and your brother are well and are doing whatever you can to combat your struggles    Please don't let your mental health keep you from having children or doing anything if that is something that will make you happy  Having my son is probably the best thing that has ever happened to me  next to marrying the love of my life  Parenting is fucking difficult and draining and I'm always covered in some sort of goo but I wouldn't ever go back  My family helps keep me grounded  especially when I have my really bad days  My son and my husband are my reasons for sticking around when I feel like I can't and it's truly a blessing  My son has brought me so much more joy than struggle  Do what you feel is right for you but don't let your illness hold you back from doing something you want because there is a chance of failure  healthy parents struggle all the same because kids are just difficult    Be well friend Of course But who the fuck takes polls though     I guarantee you wouldn't want to sleep with any woman that has ever taken a poll  You can't do much  I mean you're still a teenager so your probably confused or something idk  Just don't care for it since you've already done it I guess Maybe try and match with her  How do i know if i got the passion for food or being a chef    I love the people around at work   they teach me many things   I try to put flavors together   i try to remember what they say  I'm like a "work donkey"    in service i'm everywhere and helping everywhere    I don't got college  I got my 9 and 10 class and then i started working as chefstudent    How should i tell my family and my collages and such  I'm working at a top 10 restaurant in the whole world and i don't seem to be passion about it    there is hope  i'll not play out your fantasyIt is time to move on  but it would be better to have a gig lined up   even if it is your own side business  How about the JET program  Do they often have people they sponsor to be in Japan just vanish You presume she is capable of using it  From the sound of it  a tablet is her limit  Well the choice is yours ultimately  it's your situation  If you want her  If you want to let her go  There's no incorrect decision  just a life where you don't like unrequited feelings I would guess next to none  Lately  whenever I put pressure on my leg  I get sharp stabs of pain  It's very painful to walk  and run  The pain is on the outside of my right leg  right below my hip  Any suggestions on what I did  and how to heal it I have a friend in therapy and his therapist says that anytime your mind goes to a weird place like this  it's a smokescreen for a deeper issue that you're not dealing with  Only you would know what that could possibly be This is your best bet  Etsy people will buy hats made in China if they are cute enough  so a hand made hat should command a price  This is about a tribute to him  and a lesson for you    1  Do not let yourself feel guilty  You did not know enough information to make the the right choice  and even though the right choice of words may have changed the short term outcome  and given you a chance to work on the long term outcome  he had problems   2  Words have consequences  Something as simple as I love you  By itself  those words mean alot to people  Simply reaching out and connecting is important  If you suspect someone is having a down day  something as simple as saying I love you  and sitting with them and drinking a cup of cocoa is important  Something as simple as holding hands  one of life's little pleasures that is more important than money  or having stuff   3  Do not try to negate the reasons that he gave in a suicide note with accusations like "he was cruel"  or "he was selfish" etc  If someone feels strongly enough about something to commit suicide  those feelings have weight  Saying someone is cruel when they have caused the ultimate loss to themselves is inherently selfish  Of course you cannot go back and connect with them  they are dead  But respect their last feelings  Imagine if he had committed suicide because he had an accidental drug interaction that messed with his head  Simply calling him cruel because he did the deed without thinking about the problem trivializes the reason and does nothing to teach you how to handle the next possible scenario where this could happen   4  Remember  this is not about pointing fingers  It is not your fault  because you had no knowledge  It his not his fault  because he was emotionally disturbed  This is not a shift blame fault game  This is about understanding  paying tribute  and giving him a good send off  It is the best we can do   Destiny is PS4 only but it's really great  Look  maybe I'm creepy  but when I was like 15  I experienced with a lot of homemade things  90  of them is worse than your hand  don't waste your time with those  The only enjoyable was the Fifi rubber glove  either you blow it up or roll it into a towel  But that is decent  everyone should try it out once  the blown up version kinda has the feeling of a vagina   not

Filthy Frank I mean really  what we really need  is an army of fuckable robot children   Every time I've clicked on one of the blips it's a middle aged man accused of inappropriately touching a minor in one way or another If you're covered under your parents' health plan  ask if you can have a full physical because it's a new year and you want to start it off right  Also say that you want to go into the exam room on your own like a grown up  When you're alone with the doc  tell him her what's going on in your head and that you want to be referred to someone who will help you  If it comes from a doctor  it may be more palatable to your folks than you telling them this at the kitchen table So as an outsider  the age gap doesn't seem weird  You've given me food for thought  thanks Do you see a therapist  If not  you may feel better if you get some short term therapy to put this into perspective Are you on Prazosin  If so  is it working at all  http   www webmd com a to z guides prazosin for ptsdThank you for the information Have your doctor first give you a physical to rule out an organic reason for your distress  such as thyroid and or a vitamin D deficiency  Then ask your

concerns  And when you say inappropriate  what do you mean It's most likely not going to make much difference with girls  but you will feel better about yourself  My bad  I felt like I heard that it was  Even better  more people can play it  Be friends with whoever you want to be friends with  Don't date jealous people who will give you a hard time about it I found an ADHD self report checklist test yesterday and we did it together  Problem is  our definitions of "sometimes" and "often" do not align  At least it wasn't a fight  I'll check the sub and video  Thank you very much  I heard there is place in FL where they all live under a bridge because there is other place for them to live You have nothing to look forward to  You've made your life work work work  then sleep  You need to plan a life for yourself outside of work that does NOT entail sleeping  Set up some enjoyable things for YOU    after  work  Even if it's going for a mani pedi or haircut and color  you need to nurture yourself  OP  None of that is going on here This is the sucky part  but at some point you will have to recognize that she is suffering and that you have to end it for her to be humane  When the time comes   use a visiting vet   Do not take them to the vet or a shelter or anywhere else  Do it at home and do it right  That is what you owe her in the end    And if you think this sucks  just wait until you have a human loved one who starts the decline  The only thing that makes a dog worse is that they are innocent creatures Why I don't play it anymore but I believe the dlc is ps4 exclusive before it hits the Xbox One I don't know  they just give me a weird vibe  The one was talking to me the other day about putting ass cheeks on a cold toilet seat    Just weird and uncalled for in my opinion  Not something a 23F wants to talk to a  new  35 year old male coworker about  I totally agree with this  Before I used tinder  I didn't try talking to girls because I figured they wouldn't be into me  but once I tried tinder  I matched with girls I would never imagine would've been interested in me  had we meet in real life  I'm actually dating a girl I met through tinder so I'm happy I gave it a shot  Congrats to you OP hope it all works out  Thanks   Yes  I read a lot of things on the internet and no matter how hard it is  the best way to go forward is to learn from the experience and work on the future  I know my mistakes  I know hers too  I can only use these to prevent them from happening later You're better off letting her go to avoid drama  imo  You always have the option to continue forward and it might even end up in your favor but there's plenty of pitfalls to ruin your current standing with her and your friend  Unfortunately this is one of the downsides of juggling your options around and being indecisive  The only reason you sprung into action is because one of your prospects were leaving  Maybe she was the most promising or the best one and it forced your hand to not let her go    Currently you might not be sure if you care so much because you like her or because you're scared of losing her  Maybe it's some weird form of greed where you don't want to lose your prospect  Whether you actually like her or not your options are very clear  Risk 2 friendships and go after her when the indications are your friend likes her and she might like you both  but still rejects you  or move on  In my opinion moving on is better  she might be a lovely gal and all but if you didn't feel compelled to go after her until you got jealous then you should wait for someone you cant help but want instantly    Best of luck  Maybe this is a lot of projection so sorry if it sounds very presumptuous  Hope it all works out in the end for all 3 of you When you are starving  all you can think of is food   This is also true with sex   I wish sex work  prostitution  is legal and regulated all over the U S  for the safety of the women and their customers   It is so in many European countries currently  Austria  Germany  Netherlands  Switzerland  etc   but only in some rural counties in Nevada  U S A   This outdated morality has kept many American FAs in misery   For FA's who want to explore sex work in Nevada  check out this book  https   www amazon com Official Guide Best Houses Nevada ebook dp B00K1KERJ4 ref sr 1 5 ie UTF8 qid 1483459077 sr 8 5 keywords nevada prostitution  5 years ago  aged 33  substitute OkCupid for Tinder  and I wrote a very similar post  under a throwaway   Congrats I am an FA girl  There's an entire sub of FA women     Rule 2  May I ask why You must be worried about third party judgment  Let me reassure you  if someone is judging you  they're doing it wrong  You're the best judge of your character are you not  I can't gain entry into your head except for what you allow Prostitutes  or "hookers"  are women who are paid cash for sex or other sexual services  which is also illegal in the United States  I can't speak for other countries as I'm not sure    If you want to be in a relationship with a woman whose entire career involves being paid for sex by several other men  most of whom she doesn't know anything much about  that's your prerogative  but I would imagine your friend is just trying to warn you of the risks  sex workers have a much higher risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases which she could pass on to you  If you enter into a relationship with one  that most likely will not change how she earns her income   through illegal  in the United States  at least  exchange of sexual services for money  Do not enter into a relationship with a prostitute  hooker  with the expectation that she will stop hooking   It isn't a classification of her as a type of person  it is a classification of her career type  Your question is really similar to  "Why do we have to classify people as teachers or doctors  It's wrong to classify people this way " It's a career  You call the person who taught you high school math your teacher  you call the person who prescribes medications your doctor  you call the person you pay for sex your hooker  It isn't like calling someone by stereotypes such as "hippie" or "stoner" or "jock"   it's their career  It's just the name of the job  you can't just decide she isn't a "hooker" because you don't like the way it sounds   My advice would be to steer clear  nothing good will likely come of this "relationship" you mention It shouldn't be a burden  you're right  But  part of me really wants to get back into it   except there's nothing to back the thought up  Being paid for it wouldn't be a bad idea  definitely something I can look into My cat is awesome  And way sweeter  And much cheaper  That's pretty mild and typical adult talk  Nothing uncalled for or inappropriate  Great advice  Sounds like her home is a contributing factor  You don't owe them a damned thing  I raised three children and gave them every advantage I could afford on a middle class income  and  they  don't owe me a damned thing  I had children because I wanted them  not because I needed someone to support me in old age  Your parents are toxic  Give them nothing Hang out in the lounge  keep your door open  walk your floor and see what people are up to in their rooms and ask about their day  Around dinner  walk the hall and ask if anyone wants to go to the dining hall   Source  It's what I did freshman yearIt's just his entire vibe all together that I don't like  I don't want to be talking about asses while in my office calculating numbers  especially with a man that looks at me and every lady here funny  Alright man no problem In a sick way  I do want him to be shattered  But how shattered could he be  now that he can officially date her  The wonderful woman who has been emotionally supporting him through our marital difficulties   But to his credit  he has been adhering to our agreements to avoid meeting and generally staying away from our home out of respect for my wishes   He could have come over and started moving out the expensive stuff in the aparrment but he didn't   I guess I could still trust him that he doesn't want to hurt or inconvenience me in any way  I supposed he still lived with shame and guilt for crapping all over his marital vows   Inb4 someone mentions it    I will only change the locks after he has moved his bigger stuff out  I didn't forget  Has she tried joining groups at her school and making friends that way  And if her eyes make her look mentally disabled  has she tried wearing dark glasses  No one should rely on just one person for friendship and no one should keep a friend around as an emotional crutch  Check out Witcher 3Ok  I see now  I was not educated on sex before  thanks Looking back over 6 decades  yes  I'm an older Redditor  we exist   I'd say you're going to reach an apex within each decade  You can make a million plans  but life can truly get in the way  don't be so hard on yourself I say "salut " It's better anyway  Who needs to involve a god Lots of things also don't have good low no sugar alternatives  Anything fruit related has fairly high sugar content  even when it's "no sugar added" Go to the doctor  You might have a tumor Well yeah  but that's because natives on those countries don't exactly have access to a lot of white guys  Compare it to North America  and most of them would choose a white guy over their own race Sugar isn't inherently bad  most things are fine in moderation with a balanced diet   http   www bodybuilding com content the science of sugar and fat loss htmlI have it  Can't live without  Me and my dad are on the internet at the same time and I download a lot of movies and series You're just getting to know her  relax  It's only wierd because you're focusing so much on getting to know one person  Let things happen naturally  Be genuine in your interest and in time you'll figure out whether you like her or not Then tell your supervisor that Once I found how out how little data I was actually using  thanks to wifi and app settings  there seemed no point in unlimited data  I haven't had to contain my usage at all with an 8gb cap  I'd recommend you take a look at your data usage  AT T app will show you  over time and decide for yourself  though Thanks  That helps  I still don't know if I'll say anything  but at least I'm not going to rule it out so easily Not wasting it at all  What do you think you're missing out on  You have money to do MORE things with a good jobListen  Truly listen to people and be genuinely interested in what they have to say  Also  become an observer of life around you and look for the funny stuff  I have a friend who is the center of attention because he has the knack for observing interesting human behavior and reporting back to the rest of us All of this is a long way away  but she isn't nearly Vietnamese enough to do any of that  she is trying to distance herself from it You are among the lucky few  Don't give it up   If you feel like you're "Missing Out" then take some time off  and use your banked money to go on vacation or something http   imgur com a0hLIsKThanks Ill try that outYea  well  that's what I did  Perhaps picking up new hobbies such as going to the Gym if you don't already  That way you are forced in different environments you're not used too making you feel less uncomfortable around others e g exercising at a Gym puts you in a place where others are trying to do the same thing  and I'm sure if you're interested in exercise others around you will like similar things  You could break his arms and legs with baseball bat What about "Those of you who feel content with your lives  tell us why"   Well her parents don't accept any of that added you  accept me when you get the chance   I shat    a lot Oh  thanks for the technicality   asshole  Reported That escort thing happened over two years ago and I don't plan on it ever again  I know this girl im with is golden and it would tear me up if things ended over some pussy  I highly doubt anything will happen between me and my buddies girl  I probably would pussy out of it anyway   If we break up naturally then thats that but I wont be the cause of it with cheating  I am insecure as fuck and I felt that this other girl wanting me kind of throw me up in my ego like you wouldnt believe  Ive recently began to think im getting ugly and I'm fucking 5 foot 3   I feel like no girl but my own likes me now  That if things were to go sour ive lost my prime and going to be alone forever    Why do we classify women this way   It's more like classifying a job  A plumber is still a person  but their title is plumber  If you're saying "hooker" is a derogatory term for a prostitute then I don't know what to tell you  It is what it is and "classification" of people as their job titles is normal  If you want to date a hooker then that's your prerogative but there's a reason they are mostly looked down upon  No one dreams about being one  it's a job you fall into when you have nothing else going for you  A majority of them have some sort of hardship where they have to work for easy money  be it drugs  school  a loved one  etc    If you see nothing wrong with dating someone that will sleep with other people every workday  then go for it  Most people can't handle it for obvious reasons  In short  Hookers are not always terrible people but are most likely in terrible places in their lives  Trying to use morality or the "we're all just people in the end" route is incredible naive  If you want to date a hooker just do it  but if you can't handle a friend telling you it's a bad idea  it is  then you should back out now  I promise you that worse things will be said about your relationship if you go forward  She used to wear dark glasses  Those also did not help at all  she has attempted to make other friends  but those people turned out to not be the nicest of friends  One of them invited her to the movie theater and left her there by herself to see the movie with her boyfriend saying "she wouldn't be able to see it anyway" and the other friend she made stole money from my sister  so it hasn't been going well  Obviously we all know using her as a crutch wasn't great and we kept on telling her to stop putting all her eggs in one basket and to make more friends  but it is incredibly incredibly hard for her  I will say that how people treat my sister has made me become incredibly jaded towards teenagers  If you do get a purebred pug make sure to clean their wrinkles  And get one with the longest snout so they won't have  too  many breathing problems  To echo what another person said  pug mixes are the way to go  My dog is a pug mix and he's the best  but I am biased  They are very intelligent people  its just that leads to arrogance  The main argument I've heard from them personally is "No one in Vietnam has depression "Damn  sounds pretty nice  So I take that if a white guy moves to any place in India or China  he'd suddenly get every girl he wants    Oh wait no  that's not the case Do any of your friends have younger siblings  Maybe put together something with your friends and their siblings with you and your sister  Due to budding health problems in my 50's that the doctors said was normal  just getting old  deal with it  I changed my diet  By the time I was done  I have stopped wheat  corn  soy  sugar  and dairy  Beef also as it makes me sick    there are LOTS of other meats out there  thawing an on sale  after Christmas duck right now  Now 66 and doctors  dentists  peers are amazed at how good my health is  Most forgot when I had problems years ago and now say I must have good genes and I am just weird for eating the way I do    Sugar is probably the worst evil out there In a similar ish situation  Joined clubs and made acquaintances  talk to people in class and in uni  but nothing I really consider a proper friendship  Shit sucks  I'm in the same situation when it comes to not being huge into clubbing and more into just hanging out  catching movies or just having a drink but I can't seem to find similar minded people  It's a bit scary to see many having their proper groups of friends already  Like being left behind   Only difference is that I'm in a foreign country and living in a studio alone as there are no dorms  Why should you care  You have a pretty good idea about what she's trying to do so just move on  There's nothing to gain here  there's not even good gossip to gain from talking to her  my course is ass  I go to NHC Hitchin and it's bearable  but I'd definitely like to swap it out for an apprenticeship and some philosophy A levels  you  I don't know the UK specifically but I do know there will always be a need for people in the field  There is nothing wrong with wanting a vocational career I think this helps out a lot  I think my only concern is  because it's not something you can just get back after you drop it  I don't want to keep having to buy more and more data every month if I go over    But it's a good step to look into that more  Thanks At least it's show business Move   you'll make new friends and you're able to keep up with your old ones  You can still text and call them and meet up with them   You'll also develop some important skills  making friends in a new already developed social structure   This will happen again in life when you start a new job   Aww    you both are lucky to have each other Well  I would go for therapy asap  Are you still living at home  If so  start saving and making plans to move    Your relationship with your parents will never be the same    You have to take care of yourself  Your father is an enabler  so I would be suspicious about his motives     Please  go for therapy and move away  This family situation is extremely toxic and dangerous  Truly   I'm happy that you have good friends in your current high school  but eventually you'll have to part ways with them  Move or stay  you won't be hearing much from them after you graduate   I moved high schools three times and it wasn't that bad  The refreshment brought by the change even helped me motivate myself to study better  Long commutes on the other hand are a pain in the ass  I've worked and studied in places that took over an hour to get to  and the stress was unbearable Yeah for me I don't download stream a ton on my phone  but I could  I hadn't thought about that aspect of dropping Unlimited data  That can really rack up the GBs quickly   Thanks for the feedback How to end time  die Like I said I'm used to it now and it really doesn't bother me   I just try not to get into situations where it can get nasty  I find games like GTA5 online particularly toxic   I do think that you should continue to do the things you enjoy  don't stop gaming because someone says you are rubbish at it  There is a saying "Opinions are like butt holes  everyone has one "  Just because it is someone's opinion that you are bad at a game  that's their opinion  you have to choose whether or not to listen to it  If these people are your real friends they would try and help you out like "try this gun or use that perk or stay over there" ect  People just being nasty aren't worth your while and you're better off staying away from them because they won't be of any help to your personal feelings   You could be the best player in the world but you just had a bad game or 2 or 3 and that's ok  The most important thing is to enjoy it and have fun  and when the fun stops then change something whether that be the game itself or the people  Yes sometimes being off mic is good but don't make any of your experiences stop you talking or being who you really are   You are right  there are alot of horrible people everywhere in this world and it's worse online because people can hide behind their computer  Be strong  surround yourself with good people  Like you said there are some genuinely kind and amazing people in this world  I've met some of the nicest people online that have been my friends for years  The ones that weren't are a distant memory  Remember  everything in life teaches us a lesson and we are still learning  Let decades pass  You'll likely get over it Thank you  Your perspective means a lot  I'm sorry things didn't work out the way you wanted them to   I have noticed denial is extremely common between family members when it comes to rape abuse incest and I don't really understand why   I definitely wouldn't react that way if I was told something like that  but I wonder if I'm just different because I think like a victim  Either way  we both deserved better in this situation That sucks man  but tbh the first time is 50 50 anyways  If you're feeling down about yourself  remember that everything that was good and worthwhile about you before that hapoened is still true  So take your time to be down  then pick yourself up and get back out there  You've learned to compartmentalize which has no reflection on your character or mental stability  My detachment from traumatic situations has allowed me to be helpful to family and friends in a more productive manner  I have the ability to think things through in a rational manner without being paralyzed with emotion  You can be the shoulder that people cry on  which is just as important Most state DMV web pages will tell you exactly what you need to bring with you No unfortunately notPhysically  I'm short  scrawny  middle aged  and so ugly in the face that people react comment on it in the street  In the 90s  I made the mistake of uploading a picture to an early internet website and for many years afterwards it was used as an example of an exceptionally ugly person and was featured on websites like fugly com and other sites specializing in early internet snark  I can still find it today if I look   Emotionally  I am a solitude loving  extremely selfish and  when I believe I have been wronged  an exceptionally vindictive person  I am miserly and do not like to share   Socially  I am a member of no group  I am not religious  not part of any ethnic group  not interested in watching or participating in sports  not interested in group activities in general   Geographically  I live in an area that is predominated by retirees and ethnic groups  both of which I do not identify with   Professionally  I am the holder of a position which really requires no interface with other people outside of a computer   Sexually  I never wanted to father children  In addition  I am endowed with a borderline microphallus which I suspect would limit any interest by a MOTOS in me  Furthermore  my sexual appetite has never been high and now  in my forties  has diminished to the point where I hardly even masturbate anymore   I am simply not attracted to any of the MOTOS in my league  To expand on that point  the imaginary MOTOS I have in my head during masturbation may as well be from a different genus and species than the women I could get in real life  It would not be fair to myself or that person to feign interest   Finally  and perhaps most importantly  I'm quite happy with the way my life has turned out  I do not desire to change This must be a truly great experience  The lack of punctuation says it all wow lots of usI wish I had your problems  I'd be happy with 20k to pay off student loans   Anyway  if I were you I'd rent the apartment  You really don't want to blow your cover  Once it's out  there is no way to put it back  If after some  Time you trust this person then tell them  but for now your secret should come first Dude awesome way to start 2017 Thankfully I have already been able to move away  Can't afford therapy at the moment  but would like to go back to therapy eventually A lot of these end up on TumblrThe post that spawned this talk can be found  here  https   www reddit com r socialskills comments 1hv1ut former shy here i recently did a 30day social   and is still one of the most popular posts of all time on this board   I wanted to say thanks to r socialskills for making it possible for me to give this talk  and for making it clear to me that social skills education is something that people want to hear about  and an issue that we need to address   In order to help as many people as possible overcome what I did  I'm currently developing a workbook course related to the 90 Strangers idea and am thinking of pursuing a master's in developmental psychology  I envision myself doing individual and small group coaching someday soon  taking people that suffer from social anxiety out into 'the field' and guiding them through making conversation and small talk with strangers out in public   So basically  thank you again reddit for helping me realize my purpose in life  I hope you enjoy the talk congratulations  people overlook how tough body dysmorphia can be to live with  well done on seeking help I work on a college campus  and I talk to some   Some are great  but for a relationship   It'd be like going with children   Edit  I'll specify that I'm 'way old Agreed  I thought i was shooting myself in the foot by getting a 6 GB plan  Between that and the WiFi I use  every month I have about 4 GB of data rolling over  3

for women who have been sexually abused  Where I live  there's a place called Independence House that serves abused women for free  You would certainly qualify You know your usage  The trick would be to see if the other packages support the amount of data you use a month The issue has been that there is limited communication with his family  During the time in which he was leaving  his mother also moved away from the states back to Samoa to be with his father  The remainder of his family lives in New Zealand and there is no social media presence to speak of  It's just odd that he disappeared completely  There had been no online activity  his phone has been turned off  and last I personally spoke to him was around Christmas 2015  I'm just wondering if Reddit detectives are capable of helping me find something about his possible whereabouts I envy you  I'd just pick him up in one of your cars tell him it's a car from the company you've been investing in or a car you bought off them for cheap after their lease was up  Companies switch cars all the time and lease them because it's less expensive with tax etc  I'd base how I'm going to treat him of his reaction to the car  Craigslist hits  Post his number looking for 'casual encounters'  Order A LOT of pizza with his number and address  Respond to escorts  tell them to show up at his place  Post 'free xbox 1' and write about how your son's a little shit and to punish him you're giving away his xbox in the description  His phone will get blown the fuck up You're 19 years old with a well paying job  I know 30 year olds with nothing  dead end jobs   Litetally  youre years ahead of the majority of people  You're not old enough to experience any real fun yet anyways     Stick with it  accumulate time off and then use that time to explore  vacation and fun     yea  fuck that that attempt bullshit   on another note I agree with  the guy posting I've  tried for a year straight and nothings worked out    I  am  so  sick  of  this I'm still in Year 10 but I chose Art for a some stupid fucking reason  I'm bad at it but I'm hoping I scrape atleast a B with it after I leave High I'm so sorry to hear about that and overall I know exactly what you mean   My ex left me when I really needed her the most and while I was  and still am  sad about it  I'm also just so angry that she could do that to me   I think that anger may be why you can't cry   Don't force yourself to do anything though or think it's weird because you're "supposed" to be reacting a certain way but you aren't   Everyone is different and this may just be how you're handling it   Just remember to accept who you are and try not to confuse yourself by forcing emotions that aren't there Sounds to me like you need  " Dialectical Behavior Therapy  DBT "   It's a form of therapy that focuses on changing behaviors such as  Mindfulness  Distress Tolerance  Interpersonal Effectiveness and Emotion Regulation  Please research it  http   psychcentral com lib an overview of dialectical behavior therapy  I imagine Nurses got a busy schedule with all the work they have to do  What do you think the negative effect will be But if you "put yourself out there"  that's a form of "looking for love"  so it's all hypocritical why's he giving me that look at the end is he gonna fuck the butterfly YOU don't have basis for contacting the HR department with your fiancé's company   You are not a party to the issue as you are   a  not an employee of the company  and b  are not the one being harrassed   On the other hand  your fiancé has a solid reason for filing a sexual harassment claim with the HR department  That's a sad thought  but probably why I like long  hot bubble baths That's a terrible self help guide 32  I'm working on it  I wonder if the fact that it's a Netflix original will change anything It really doesn't concern you though Anywhere there is some interaction with people who aren't your close friends or family   The opportunities are really endless  which doesn't mean frequent       What really helped me was to realize that technically  as long as I didn't shut myself in too much  an opportunity would come up eventually  numbers game    What was more important than thinking how to make it happen was to be ready for when it did happen    We don't all look like Brad Pitt maybe  but you don't have to look like Brad Pitt to be clean  wear nice clothes that fit  eat a semi good diet that helps your complexion  and sleep enough to have the energy to be sharp  Then it's just a matter of keeping your eyes open for opportunity and making the most of them when they come   If those things seem difficult or even impossible to do  you almost certainly have depression anxiety and you need to start treating that before anything else  You are most likely stuck in negative feedback cycles as far as your thoughts are concerned  and your brain needs to be 're wired' as to how it automatically reacts to certain thoughts   It sounds more complicated than it is   but it is a commitment and requires sustained effort to before it bears real fruit  But if you make looking after yourself  and having compassion for yourself your number one priority  everything else begins to fall into place   Cognitive behavioural therapy is quickly becoming the standard treatment for mood disorders  quite simply because it works   Look into Mind Over Mood  awesome book that helped establish CBT as a treatment  Look at the resources over on  r mindfulness  Do a Google search on your local area to see what resources are available  this is most likely your most effective option  a person you can talk to and can coach you is really your best bet   Speaking to a doctor could also help point you in the right direction      If this strikes a chord with anyone  feel free to message me  I love chatting about how it changed my life and want to spread the word   So did you "make it"  No longer FA or have a lot of friends   Some mild social anxiety here and gay too  so it's hard to meet others  I was afraid I'd have to convert to an extreme social butterfly  But that seems like the only possible way to break FA for good  2017 goal  be social as fuck even if it feels awkward and I seem creepy Supposedly  Chris Columbus  Producer on the Harry Potter series  interviewed the families of the actors before he made his choice because he knew he was basically handing the lottery to these families   He did the Home Alone movies too  and wanted to make sure the kids didn't end up like Macaulay Culkin   I'm sure to some degree this was selfish  also  If you're going to do a movie series as long as HP  you want to make sure your primary actors are healthy the whole way through since  by the nature of them  you have to film them as they grow older  It wasn't like LoTR where Jackson could film multiple movies simultaneously  or back to back to back to back My favorite game is Oblivion too   uh  we have literally been still talking hanging out  SHE added me on instagram and re added me on snapchat     I'm thinking more that she is hiding somethingWhat makes you practically a wizard Thank you for your response  I am a religious person  I agree  talking to a priest or joining some sort of life group within my church may help Depends on what you mean by "bad"   For those reading that article  probably bodybuilders   sugar can be useful   For something like protecting against DNA damage or longevity  sugar only seems to do harm Thank you  it's really a relief to have gotten this off my chest  I believe that this occurs as a form of coping with my emotions  which I have a hard time accepting  Is there any way I could get the help that I need without talking to my parents Cool  Good for you for having a non jealous boyfriend  Ignore what your parents are saying  They sound old fashioned  Of course it's all ultimately pointless      But if you are able to find joy  bliss  something you are passionate about  and someone who will miss you when you're late coming home     Find these things and the journey is amazingly fulfilling Unfortunately the best way to ensure pictures aren't leaked is to not send any at allMaybe try giving her a note so she can approach you first Back in the 1960s  a sugar industry executive wrote fat checks to a group of Harvard researchers so that theyd downplay the links between sugar and heart disease in a prominent medical journaland the researchers did it  according to historical documents reported in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine  One of those Harvard researchers went on to become the head of nutrition at the United States Department of Agriculture  where he set the stage for the federal governments current dietary guidelines   All in all  the corrupted researchers and skewed scientific literature successfully helped draw attention away from the health risks of sweets and shift the blame solely to fatsfor nearly five decades  The low fat  high sugar diets that health experts subsequently encouraged are now seen as a main driver of the current obesity epidemic   http   arstechnica com science

treats you differently because of it  he's not really your friend  Maybe ask how they see that increasing over time In my opinion  attempting to negotiate or raise the salary they offer at the interview is never a good idea ahaI used to have a really cynical view too  I saw no point in continuing on  But I was suggested to take on hobbies I enjoyed  So I took up lifting  Been doing it for 3 years and it always helps me see life in a healthier perspective whilst giving me goals to achieve  If you want to have a point to work for in life  find something you enjoy  that helps you escape lifes problems  stick to it and get involved in the community  You make new friends and tend to forget your problems more often I agree with this  First step  see your GP  they'll rule out any physical issues   can write you a referral which will help with insurance coverage  If they are unable to make specific recommendations you should then be able to find specific providers through your insurance network  Once you have that list you can Google the doctors and read online review which may help in choosing the right one for you  And remember  if you start seeing someone   you don't feel that they are working for you  you can try a different one u til you find one who is best suited for you  I went through a couple before finding someone who I thought was really helpful  Good luck Nope  Don't have any  Otherwise  I wouldn't have this problem You don't want to get those demons that enter your soul when you sneeze  Well  teenagers are assholes  if you're planning to pursue art into college or uni don't worry it'll be a lot less academic there  and i know it's a cliche but on a genuine note pick something you'll love to do as a career even if the pay is shit  trust me daddy  don't spend the rest of your life doing something which is just pure dickIt may not sound easy it may not be easy but that's what needs to happen I've been there and if you don't just move on it will kill all your future relationships and make you a very unhealthy person both personally and to be around for anyone elseWell  you could start with making your own appointments  You're 18 and an adult after all Well if he blows my cover   i just don't want loads of folk beating a path to my door   Sorry  I believe I answered you something different to your question  A lot of people share similar problems to you  more than what you might think actually  It's normal to feel like this when you're going through a shitty situation and sometimes it helps you become more confident in other aspects after seeing the 'other end' of the tunnel  You begin to feel isolated at times and look through a narrative perspective as you're constantly on the edge about what you're dealing with and as I've said before almost everyone goes through this  How do you view sugars in fruits  5  hours per week is not bad for health  Where did you get that misinformation  And  are you male  because if you can't do straight pushups then you are way too weak  Eat a lot and get stronger  man  You'll love how it makes you feel Thank you for the advice  Thankfully I already have a therapist in the event I can't handle it I've been married for almost 10 years now  It's a marriage that I don't see making to 11 if it continues as it is   One of the biggest things I've learned from being married is that you should use these early relationships to learn what your relationship needs are  as well as what you should do to make sure you have successful relationships  Use this time to find those things you like in a partner  along with figuring out what your relationship strengths and weaknesses are    Like you I had a lot of self esteem issues growing up  I never had a solid  meaningful relationship with anyone until I met my wife  I only dated one other girl before her  and reflecting on that relationship after it ended made me realize that I never had one with her  that it was mostly a sexually charged relationship  There was love there but even looking back on it 15  years later I realize there was so much more I could have done with her    I can see where that lack of relationship experience has brought me to in the relationship I have with my wife  When I proposed I really felt that it was my one final chance  I was 30   I never went out to try to meet women  Being shy with low self esteem made me hold myself back from going out and meeting women throughout my young adult life  I also struggled career wise  I never could figure out what I really wanted to do so I had doubts there  I'm a bit socially awkward too so that certainly won't help in some cases   Anyway  having that lack of experience in relationships has hurt the relationship with my wife by not giving myself the understanding of what is important for me in a relationship  It's made me rethink my entire marriage  as well as what I may do going forward as I try to salvage it  Things may be a little better than they were but it's hard as hell now  and has been for almost 10 years Alright  I try to deceive myself all the time  but instincts are massive  Now I wonder whether there is an end to this depth If you don't love her  why did you say yes to her proposal  Maybe you should show her all aspects of your life  dark ones included  Then her unconditional love may not feel "wasted on you" as you put it  I don't want to pursue Art but I want to get a masters degree in graphic design  I thought having Art down on my report would be good but I chose Graphic Design AND Art  I am not enjoying Art as I thought I would and it's not because it's academic I don't think  I think it's because my teacher expects me to do better but I can't  I don't know how to  He just expects to look into things such as Expressionism and makes us copy a famous artists  Then you got these girls in my class who get sad because they get A's and not A 's    Hi sorry you have to click on the Help Fight Traumatic Brain Injury and Major Depression  but here is the link it self https   www youcaring com emilypierce 727102  Thank you for responding Kind Regards  EmilyThats what I thought   Thanks for confirming my opinion ahah Good idea   Thanks  Contact the JET program would be your first step  Contact your embassy in Japan and let them know that your friend is missing  Contact the police or even INTERPOL  If they ignore you  keep calling  Keep bothering them until they start looking     Does he have any friends in Japan  Have you tried talking to them  When was the last time they had contact with him  I think I am near this point  So much "nihilization" of the theme  that I hope  really  to be successfully not attached to it any longer Oh man  I'm so sorry  I can't believe I didn't see this ages ago  I'm not on Reddit often     Sorry to hear about your mom  that must've sucked to hear  It sounds like a pretty insensitive thing to hear  If you wanna talk more about it  I promise I'll be more responsive this time  p  I hope things have improved now that the holiday is more or less over  Happy New Year  Hope your year is better than 2016   understand  I do  It's actual physical pain  a burning sensation in the arms  it's hard to breathe etc  Can't cry though  for better or worse How I feel every time I send a nice  thoughtful message and get ignored or hear a cold "not my type" They're largely responsible for the person I am today  It'd be foolish to say that had zero impact on who I am and how I respond to things  I haven't really talked to them in a very long time  I'm guessing they're disappointed  I am so ugly that people feel physically sick looking at me  they've said this themselves   people  men and women  have crossed the street to avoid me and that's not to mention the taunts and disgusted looks I get  I know how you feel This guy is emotionally abusive  Block him on all media   try to move on  Staying in bed too long is a sign of depression  but when you're depressed it's the only place you want to be  An endless cycle You really need to make it clear how much it means to you  I'm sure you have  but make sure they know It's serious stuff  That's exactly what service animals are for   My little sister attempted to take her life when her cat died and nobody saw it coming  She was in a coma for 5 days and doctors said if she ever woke up she would be a vegetable and we should start looking into care home facilities if we didn't want to pull the plug    After she recovered my dad got her a new cat and she's been pretty well between that and seeing a councilor  but even now I've heard her mention that she doesn't know what she'd do without her cat and her previous cat was a huge thing that kept her going in life  It gave her a sense of purpose  to take care of it The worst is hearing "just join a group"  Been there  done that many times  Full of much older  married  or straight people  Sigh   I mean imagine  "Hello  thank you for arriving on time etc   so you seem pretty qualified do you have any question you want to ask us " "MOREEE MONEYYY"It's okay   Being an IT job  I have to interact with WAY more people than I wanted expected to  but it's useful for developing my social skills I guess   It also distracts me from the sad thoughts that constantly fester in the back of my head  so that's pretty nice  then ask how her dad is   Ok  you're just trolling I think nowadays  especially for younger people  the issue with abortion isn't a moral religious whatever one    As someone above posted it's more to do with the fact that they personally couldn't have one  For many people  the second they find out that they're pregnant they feel responsible for that life  Even though rationally they know that it can't feel etc    Many women who are planning on aborting still find it to be a huge deal emotionally and will continue to eat healthier and avoid alcohol etc  until they've actually had the abortion  Lose weight  take regular breaks to drink cold water  or just embrace the sweat as part of the job I get all of this  and actually this is why I think it's so important to remind people to take the morals out of this decision and consider all of your options  If you just decide that you can't have an abortion  fine  but don't let that decision be at all the result of some moralizing by someone who has questionable morals and motives Well taking someone  else  would definitely ruin everything  so   Username checks outI guess the question is what do you want to do  For many the right thing is to pick one and scale it back with the other  why the  s    The cycle only gets worse when you add in anxiety then its becomes why am i so depress  oh yeah i have anxiety so bad i can't talk to people in real life and why cant i talk to people  Because my depression keeps me in my bed all day Yeah  My roommate said he posted on Facebook that he wants to make amends  I just laughed  Here is what I would do  go speak with your doctor  you can do this without your parents  this is your right   Talk to your doctor about a therapy animal  there are many that are trained to help with anxiety and keeping you calm before you know you're about to have a panic attack   If your doctor agrees that you would benefit from a therapy animal  which are highly expensive because of their training  have your doctor speak with your parents  If they don't want to doll out the money to purchase a therapy animal  ask if you can adopt an animal from a shelter  These tend to be much less expensive and come fixed  micro chipped  and up to date on shots  Which means  they would spend 100 to 200 dollars rather than 2 to 5 grand  Thank you  I try so hard to explain to my mother how much Lucky meant  and she answers with "well it's not like he's dead" or "Well you've had problems for four years and lucky's been there since five years  so he's not that much of an help" she doesn't understand it would've been ten times worse without him  And it's not about him being dead or not  it's about the presence  the life that he brought to the house    I hope I'll get her to shift her mind  I show her pictures of bunnies and tell her about how little care they need compared to a dog    But she thinks I'm exaggerating    And I'm so sad  my uncle and grandfather committed suicide and two other uncles have made attempts  How could she take my pain so lightly  So   you DO want to get better  you just wish to succeed at it  Good  This is step number one  Forgiving yourself is number two  I know it's hard  but if it was someone else writing this message and you reading it  I bet you would wish this person to keep trying   That's what I wish for you  Forgive yourself  fuck the past  Its a horrible sensation that i wouldn't wish on my worst enemy Hello u notveryhelpful204850  Your post  as all the posts I've got  was helpful really  Thank you  I'm now concerned and I feel a little better now  But the problem is that I can't tell this to my family   My family is the only group of persons who have always loved me and they gave me and did everything they could to raise me as a normal and healthy person  although they didn't got it  After all these things I can't get to anyone of my family and tell them that I feel attracted to little girls  I just don't know what could happen and I love them so much to take the risk   But I'm decided to succeed against this and I will look for therapy Everyone is beating around the bush here  if you're attracted to children more than adults  then yes you are  You need help to control it and maybe you can have a normal life  You won't be turned in as a threat for just being a pedophile  If you tell your therapist there's a little girl on the street and you don't think you can help yourself  that's the threat that can get you in trouble  The younger you are to get help  the better off you'll be  Keep yourself busy with hobbies  being creative and being healthy like going to the gym  Meet people and socialize  Make friends and move forward  Sex with women might not be all it can be for you  but there's more to life than that  There's plenty of help out there  you just have to find it  Good luck Correct response Bring it up to him   Make sure he knows you are grateful that he is in your life and it doesn't change how much you care about it   There's no way this is real  It's a new user and this is the only post  Yes  That's what I'm planning to do  I told my psychologist  but my parents won't take her advice so I'll go ask my doctor  Wish I had the balls guts    to be vegetarian    Pushing him to eat meat is very inappropriate  I applaud him for not eating meat  even if he decides to eat meat later on   If he is healthy who cares  Just make sure he gets proper amounts of protein and other nutrients  Do yourself a favor and stop worrying about what it is  People get so hung up on labels that they don't see the bigger picture  PTSD  treatments have come a long way especially with drugs like Prazosin  As for Bipolar Disorder its a very popular diagnosis but a very rare condition  A true Bipolar person is unbareable to be around  They're like living with a drug addict who is depressed part of the time and others times they're happy draining their bank accounts  There are hundreds of other behavioral disorders that are left undiagnosed only because the arsenal of medications at the moment is focussed on Bipolar medications  The use of antisychotics and anticonvulsants have become common in the treatment of everything from sleep to depression  Doctors hate prescribing "controlled substaces" so they give you drugs like Seroquel that will ruin your life  Doctors will offer you Lamictal and Seroquel for the treatment of Bipolar Depression  Some may even toss in the new drug Brintillex or Ability  In the end you'll be fat and suffer hellish withdrawals going off  Each drug will rob you of a year of you're life going on and coming off the drug plus trying to lose the 50 100lbs weight gain  As for antidepressants they can be just as bad or worse  Perhaps trying therapy first  Something like DBT can work wonders and is not diagnosis specific  Best of luck Try not to have any activity with him  especially trading  that might get you banned alongside  because they think your account is also his  Hello u thefreakisin  Thank you for your advice  I'm looking for therapy now and I hope I can forget all these things in order to become a healthy and normal person   Don't worry for me abusing a child  That will make me the same kind of monster who did this to me and I simply can't do that  I already keep away from children and always that these feelings comes to my mind I try to think about anything else because I don't want to feel like a monster   Thank you for your help Anytime you have this kind of reaction  you're experiencing a fight or flight response  Which means that a primitive part of your mind thinks that you are in danger    There is probably a similar fear you've experienced in the past   A fear that you are not valuable or worth protecting  This may stem from a traumatic experience in which those who you relied upon to care for you were not available  leading to a fear of abandonment  Abuse and neglect are also common causes  A child might think that if they were more valuable they might be able to prevent abandonment    This associates survival with being valuable  The child changes his behavior because he fears being abandoned by those who are caring for him   Any evidence that the child is not valued or that the parents are unhappy with the child causes panic because it may  in the child's mind  lead to abandonment    The child carries this into adulthood and remains on constant guard for evidence of not being valuable  Anytime anything even touches on this  it causes panic  anxiety and or depression  The original reason for the fear eventually gets forgotten   Knowing that you are actually safe and exploring and understanding what is and isn't abandonment might help  Therapy would be a good place to work on this  For a little background I texted her  "Hey  let's talk " After a pretty long hiatus of not talking  I guess you could say "ghosting"  Got frustrated she didn't reply deleted the message thread and the she replied like 8 hours later  and now you see her new replies Heh  a body building website is your citation  I guess I should handle life that way and become an adult finally or else I will  never get out of this  Thank you for your advice so much I know what you're talking about OP  If I take a pic from far away and with good lighting  I look decently average  But  if I take a selfie in the wrong angle  I look like an orgre  It's like I have two different faces and I don't know which is the one people see most of the time Um  pretend it's your mom What an asshole  Sadly people really don't realize how serious suicide and depression really is  My father really doesn't understand it at all which made it very hard on my little sister  My dad's very logical  but sometimes has a bad tendency to not believe things if he's never experienced them  Her attempt was an real huge wake up call to him   Perhaps let your parents know that if they don't want to get you a pet you would seriously want them to consider seeing a councilor   Tell your mother immediately  Also  cut your father off  He put you in direct danger and refused to acknowledge any of it  You don't need this terrible person in your life  Making you Jealous  Isn't it obvious  Block him and move onThen I will  I just want to improve with this and face my life now and I'm decided to try whatever I need to I'm the same dude who posted  this  https   www reddit com r ForeverAlone comments 5kxn77 looking at some old fb messages found this gem  utm content comments utm medium user utm source reddit utm name frontpage  last week so I thought I'd continue my series on my tragic love life different girlThank you u usernameblankface I feel better now  despite yesterday at the time I posted this I was in tears  I hope therapy could help me with this Psychosis is a very distinct illness  It lasts for a long time and is accompanied with severe delusions  paranoia  and the inability to reason  If you become psychotic you will wind up in the hospital and will need anti psychotics to bring you out of it  What you're describing does not sound like a psychotic episode to me  coming from someone who has had a few  I think maybe it's just some weird brain chemistry going on when you wake up 100  agree with you  Basically the only way my body functions normally is to be a vegan that eats animal fat  It sounds like you don't trust him enough at this point  You might in the future but not now   You don't want to tell him about your financial situation and you are under no obligation to do so    If he asks questions about your nice house and your nice lifestyle  just be vague  Say that you've been investing and you've been very fortunate    Something to consider  Can you go visit him in his city before he visits you in London    Something else to consider  Do you want to be friends with this person  What kind of friendship do you envision  Will this friendship make your life better  worse or no change     Thank you   I'm hopeful about the future and I'm decided to get help and solve this  Your support has made a difference Thank you for your support words Life must be tough as a meme  I've never expected this amount of attention  It was really hard  I broke in tears twice and I also thought about deleting this post a lot even after I published  I'm glad I didn't   Thanks a lot for your help He probably knows you are still looking at his social media because of your text Isn't the same Why don't you seek a mental health professional I had a relative who proudly low balled an offer in a white hot market  against our advice   was turned down and ended up buying a home  again against our advice  that had a basement finish that was a DIY without a permit and against code  We advised him to gut the basement to remedy his problem  but he is "waiting to see" if it creates a problem  We live in an area of expansive soils where basement walls need to be floated to account for seasonal expansion and these floors are not  He will be lucky to have a habitable house in a couple of years if he doesn't heed our latest advice  Don't worry I've already found thanks to all who actually cared about this post and gave me serious advice Have you got a place to stay  stable job etc  I only ask as it seems you're living with your parents which would normally be okay   I would find a place to live etc and then drop the truth bomb in your mom  No offence to you but she's an idiot  how sheltered dumb could she be to not know that her eldest is a felon and pedo    Please make an update edit soon Are you in MN   Roads were an ice rink last night   I watched a guy do a 360 through a red light and miraculously not hit anyone else or end up in the ditch Is this a copypasta that I just have not seen yet  This response is way too long  thought out  and self deprecating to not stick out to me Unfortunately I know little about anything since he arrived  When we talked he said there was a lot of chaos with getting started  I attributed the lack of communication to this but became concerned when his sister posted on Facebook about his mother trying to reach him Lol  I mean the plan is either her or no one  Based on the unanimous vote from these comments  I sent the invite to her  Now I play the waiting game I actually get a kick out of it  how many chicks can say degrading shit to me to get me off their case  Usually around 2 3 months is when they start getting restlessThis is a real account  I made it to ask one question which I have  I don't even understand why he does this   I'm pretty sure you can't be vegan and eat animal fat If she loves you  and is upset that she was pining over you  and left because it hurts   are you sure she knew how you felt about her    I'm going through something similar maybe  from the other end of things  Same here  I am 23 and still live with my parents  All of my friends have all moved out and are living on their own and it makes me feel like   less  Less what  I have no idea   Just remember  you only are as old as you feel  If you feel like you aren't accomplishing enough or don't have enough experiences under your belt  then go out and get some   Great post though  glad I am not alone Just remember that it's not real  That is not how real sex usually works so when you get in that situation don't think it's going to happen like that Yeah I bet it is no big deal to them but to me it was freakin amazing Cool  or you could accept that different people like different things  If you are not into playing chess  you are not too dumb to enjoy it  you just don't enjoy it  Simple as that  The same goes for dancing  drinking partying  loud music and long nights   I don't judge you for liking them  its good that you found what you like  bit it is not for me and thats not for lack of trying and not everything you don't like or can't do is a self limiting belief It's an addiction  Every smoker out there knows it's bad for you  but they smoke anyway   edit  https   www google com  q sugar 20effects 20on 20brainI'm reading the  stupid  comments in this thread about assaulting him or playing a silly prank and I'd like to suggest that you don't do something that is a crime  You could check with the online seller to see if there are any ways for you to have your money refunded and his account with the seller blocked  like if you sell things illegally on Amazon  eBay  Failing that you could see if your bank will do anything about the purchase and refunding your money  You could even get the police involved for the misrepresentation of goods and  or theft  etc  though the latter two are long shots  It's difficult to give actual advice  not just "hurr hit em wit a train that'll show'em" when you've not provided us with very many details     Atop that there's no guarantee that the information he gave you is the correct information and you could wind up ordering a thousand pizzas to some uninvolved strangers house That career bit struck close to home  Been working in IT for a few years now  but I'm still not sure what I really want to do  Thanks for sharing  and I hope it all works out for the best for you Thank you for this comment yes it explains alot about my post history and how it affects my karma  Does it feel weird then that people are using their raw talent and hardware horsepower to dive into people's post history for dirt  No obviously this is just normal behavior and I myself am just a reflection of past experiences  problems  lack of living in one area and always moving  I have a major outsider complex mixed with habits of seeking attention  No i don't think i will make an alt account  one of my worries is that my words are my portfolio and will be seen by a hiring manager regardless of how hard I try to hide my tracks  I then need to take responsibility  trolling gaming subreddits is an illness I've latched on to due to years of poverty  jealousy  bitter suffering I do not appreciate the same values of gaming that a normal gamer in this day might have  That creates alot of problems for me and many misunderstandings  I am conscious of my negativity towards these subreddits but I am struggling to change that perspective due to the easyness of feeling protected by anonymity an illusion  Edit  ill send more edits to this post The day of I didn't once  I did it once the day before in the morning  no problem   Yes  I think about sleeping with other people every day   I've never tried to do anything about it       but if an opportunity fell in my lap  I hope I would be strong enough to resist   Years ago I was in an open relationship   We both frequently talked about people we thought were hot   and we fantasized and role played sleeping with others all the time   A couple of times a year we even invited someone else into our beds       How does this square with my first comment   Well  a couple of points     1  It wasn't cheating   All extracurricular activity was shared  discussed  planned and we had a set of rules that helped protect the relationship       2   The relationship was really strong  We shared everything  talked all the time   and knew each other well enough to feel confident in the relationship     3  We had control over if and who and when our partner slept with someone else   That control stemmed both from rules mentioned above and from the degree of transparency we shared   we each had complete access to all accounts  electronics  bills         and  as I said  we spoke openly about people in our lives whom we were interested in       Later  we had children and decided to close the relationship   After 20  years together the sex life faltered  our closeness faltered and realities of life  career problems  health issues      lead to depression and bad decisions that ended the marriage   This is where i learned how much infidelity hurt   and the damage that it does   So my lesson learned is that if the relationship is rock solid and the communication is excellent  and the relationship is well balanced  an open relationship can work   But  YMWV       My current partner is a wonderful lover   But we are not nearly as close and she is not open to sharing fantasies   which I regret   So no other partners for me       but being in a healthy relationship is worth it I just explained that it isn't a moral issue  It's an emotional issue    Absolutely fine with other people having abortions  I honestly don't understand why their is even an issue with the 'morality' of abortions in the first place  It seems obvious that every woman should have autonomy over her own body    However  I'm a little less fine about preventing one of my potential children from being born  That's nothing to do with guilt over ending a life or religious fears  It's because that foetus has the potential to be  my child  however inconvenient that many he for me    Edit  Out of curiosity are you a guy or a girl  I'm only asking because it's much harder for a guy to truly empathise with this as he's never going to experience it first hand  Well  at least you got a hobbyIt could be reactive airways  which is sometimes considered to be a mild form of asthma  As the previous commenter said  see another doctorThat's actually really sad people think it's down to genes  and therefore believe that their issues can't be fixed  Healthy diet and lifestyle is the way to go  You're missing the point      A diet isn't one size fits all  It's about the right nutrition customized for every individual  For me that means a limited list of vegetables  largely vegan diet  along with animal fat  Paleo diet  in order for my body to function at its very best    Maybe my wording was ambiguous  but I work with him  he sought out my fiance at her place of work to talk with her  So he and I do work for the same company and she is the third partyYour best bet is to call the USDA and the German consulate  Agreed  Lithium stabilizes mood whereas Lamictal is used for treating severe seizure disorders  and for bipolar disorder with more depression symptoms than manic symptoms  Its also weight neutral whereas Lithium is not  I strongly recommend trying Lamictal being that its incredibly effective in shortening depressive episodes  Lamictals titrating on and off process is time consuming but it was worth it  I've been on it for six years and its still working Yeah  this is why I said that I'm not trying to tell people to have an abortion  I'm trying to destigmatize the procedure telling them to remove morality from the decision He's your ex  so what he does now is none of your business  If you blocked each other  how were you seeing what he posted anyway How has what I said lead you to believe that their is a stigma or a morality issue Someone's addicted So how do you get the fat  just cook your veggies in bacon grease  Usually veganism is related to some sort of moral stance against the treatment of animals  If your goals are purely nutritious  why not just eat the lean meat with the fat What It actually has nothing to do with what you said  I'm telling you what my intent was for my comments that you responded to Everyone has to start somewhere   If it's really what you want to do I say go for it I came across this quote the other day   I think it's appropriate to what you're feeling   "I know people who graduated college at 21  and didn't get a salary job until they were 27  I know people who graduated at 25 and already had a salary job  I know people who have children and are single  I know people who are married and had to wait 8 10 years to be parents  I know people who are in a relationship and love someone else  I know people who love each other and aren't together  There are people waiting to love and be loved  My point is  everything in life happens according to our time  our clock  You may look at your friends and some may seem to be ahead or behind you  but they're not  They're living according to the pace of their clock  so be patient  You're not falling behind  it's just not your time "   Julissa Loaiza  I'm 27 and it's so hard not to compare myself to my peers  especially with social media where everyone only shows their highlight reel   It drives me crazy sometimes that I can't just focus on my life and be proud of my own accomplishments and realize just how hard I've worked and how far I've come  so I really liked the perspective of this quote  I'm really trying to take it to heart    And before you can say  "If you molest child then you are "  This wouldn't even be true  You can be pedo without molesting or molest without being a pedo   To me it seems like you are a paedophile  Paedphilia is nothing more than attraction    Qualifications  I'm paedophile myself and I know a fair amount of other paedophiles  He is definitely a paedophile  but possibly not beyond help Yes  I get it  I'll try to do what I want   It's so frustrating to know that such a little thing could help me give purpose to my life  but it is denied to me  I'd do anything to get a rabbit or a dog    I have to confront them before it's too late for me  Try the Beatles   Definitely will make you happy even if it last only a minute I made some significant changes in my life many new years ago because I was somewhat in your shoes  These are the changes I made   I started to exercise regularly  I started to eat much healthier and pay attention to proper  nutrition  I started to meditate daily  I began to practice daily gratitude  I slept earlier and started waking up at 530 am every day  I started practicing mindfulness in different areas of my life  I changed my daily routine to become much more productive and structured  I started practicing visualization daily  I forgave myself and others for mistakes and imperfections  I eradicated frivolous habits such as watching junk TV and replaced them with more positive habits like reading  These changes have made a huge impact on my outlook  self confidence and overall happiness  I think the changes compliment and reinforce each other so they have a quantum effect  Of course  changing 1 or 2 areas of your life is still a good thing  too   I hope this helps  I wish you well I do eat fruit  The powers that want us to eat sugar try to make us think all "sugars" are equal  Not  When I eat fruit  I eat the whole fruit  No juice    I simply cant  but I also can't stop to be attracted by little girls   This to me sounds a lot more that he is attracted to prepubscents than pubscents  Where did you get the idea that he is attracted to pubscents from You probably never will  just know that he knows he's causing you pain   he does it anyway  imo that's not someone you want in your life  No  Hebephiles are attracted to pubscent children  paedophiles are attracted to prepubscent children SpamThe biggest thing you have in your favor is that you want help and you are willing to seek it  I wish you the best as you find your way forward Yeah sorry I didn't respond  We were gonna give him a few hours before we contacted the police but he used the woman's phone to log on to Facebook and messaged one of us   So everyone ended up safe and I just forgot to respond  Thank you to everyone who answered and tried to help though  There are some threads dedicated to posts that were catfishedYeah  it really sucks when you realize a lot of people in life are pretty lousy until something serious happens  you just have to realize that and how upset everyone would be if you were gone though and understand that taking your life is never the right answer It gets a lot easier when your parents know about it  Speaking from experience here But i don't post on r chess that i'm stupid and i hate chess  and you are here on r socialskills posting same depressing stuff every couple of days  You should read an article before critiquing it     It was written by Layne Norton PhD and he cites scientific studies in the article Yeah  since when did that start  I'm guessing Game of Thrones  You should post this or other advice you've got on r LifeProTips   That sub is the better one for giving advice I heard that one of those websites does that automatically if you indicate you're an Atheist And this is why I don't even try Just invite the person to hangout with your really close group of friends once or twice and then without them after you build some sort of relationship It sounds like you don't have much day to day support    I'm sorry for that   Is there any way your family could help you out more   I am a patient for life  albeit not for something painful  so I kind of understand  and I constantly don't know what my prognosis is  if you can't handle a friend telling you it's a bad idea  it is  then you should back out now  I promise you that worse things will be said about your relationship if you go forward   No  I can  I just wanted other viewpoints on the topic We're just talking statistically here  maybe the majority of women on tinder will find that a turnoff  maybe not  better Dodge the question in the first stages of the relationship Gotcha    In this case  you and your fiancé together need to contact HR  you because you're the employee and she as the victim  If you need one more class then regardless of the reason why it's needed  and who's fault  you need to take it  I would put forth a complaint against that specific advisor though I wouldn't risk it  Just leave It totally sound like  r iamverysmart There's more to life than food bro  stop focusing on your stomachAlright so here's what we do  you route me all your money and I'll let you use my house to visit and problem solved The criminal consequences are quite extreme  I'd suggest STFU How do you know unless you try    Honestly it is up to you  There are many ways to meet women  but for me having a hobby I enjoyed was the easiest way    I joined a running club  I slowly made friends  I later became a coach  I was able to make one friend then another and another  Mostly without trying to much  When I had a strong friend base in this group and I was a known person  it was way less hard to talk to women  I knew everyone  I was confident in what I knew    But this was a ten year progress and I tried a bunch of stuff before I hit on running    Although I had to at minimum get into okay first to start a lot of these things  So you may too    But the other options are obvious  Cold approach or dating websites  Friends of friends    Not that any of this mattered really  I have friends but I'm still FA  But I'm a FA who puts himself in situations where I meet women    Yw    Roll a towel up  hand towels work best  with a unrolled condom in the middle  leave an inch sticking out the end  Then stretch the end of the condom around the outside of the towel  pour some lube in  I used vegetable oil   Voila  I doubt it  I don't try because    I can't even tell what reason I have   It just all seems like he bragging like almost everything and anything has that girl name in it  As well she be liking or commenting on everything that's on his page too  He even has her family members as his friends on Facebook  Last post I seen it was saying dear side chicks all ya'll fired cause I got bomb AF Christmas gifts this year and he tagged the girl name in it  Then he was like I seen one of my ex's at the store and she got fat  life is great and the new girl commented on it and said "Seen't Her" and he said yeah seen that bish fall off  Then he made a status saying he was out eating with the girl I am telling you about  and he said I need to date more people who don't judge me for the love of cranberry  His parents had told me he takes this girl out that like him sometimes but it's nothing serious  That he is finding himself and don't think he ready to be serious with anyone right now cause of the way his life is going as well as karma  But the way he post stuff it sound like they are more friends with benefits rather than lovers   Where in all of this does it say how you see his FB posts if you've blocked each other   Since they are issued by the state  you should look at the requirements put out by the particular state where you are getting the permit   They are not a national or international permit so it may be different in different places  How do you know unless you try    Who says I haven't tried I know there was a rumor about that with eharmony years ago but it's always been refuted  Still  I wouldn't be surprised ì know i should  i guess i'm just worried he will find out it was me Oh  snap don't wanna sound like  r gaming  but fallout 4 is a great shooter with extremely light RPG elements  It's a fun game  just not a good fallout game My family is very supportive and thats great  but I am an independent person and prefer to look after myself and pay my own way  It's difficult for me to rely on others sometimes  I feel guilty about it What is contagious that causes migraines   Are you sure you're on safe medicine  who gave it to you   Have you been to the doctor lately   If your condition hasn't improved in 20 days you need to go to the emergency room and bring what you've been taking   Your parents could be poisoning you  or there could be a carbon monoxide leak  or something else  He tells kids he wants to trade for a cs go item and then tells them he'll give them a code for a steam card or something  then he scams them and blocks them so they can't report him    He justifies it by saying he buys games for his poor friends  but 95  of the money he uses himselfi mean  this is a childhood friend  he isn't a bad guy  i'm just hoping to teach him a lesson Why not   you can do it  let's start to learn making videos making ideas from YouTube you can learn anything and then try to make a videos    all the bestAfter watching a documentary about how wide spread pedophilia is in Hollywood I pretty much worry for all child actors  I mean I knew it was a problem  but not such a wide spread and scarily common problem  he has offered to buy me games with this money in the past  but i say no every time  i don't want his blood money Not that much  why tho  lolYou are a sick individual  I hope you are joking but if you are not  you should seek therapy for yourself    OP  please do not listen to this person    Remember  this is not about pointing fingers  It is not your fault  because you had no knowledge    This is so wrong  It is not your fault because it simply is not  There is nothing you could have said or done to change this  You do not control anyone else  no matter how unwell they are What did you try  I know for a fact that it's not a tumor     Maybe muscle pull Oh no  but surely volunteering will fix that    s  But that's what family and friends are for   When my wife and I had cancer  she had hodgkin's lymphoma  I had have papillary thyroid cancer  soooooo many people helped us   We moved in with her folks to be close to treatment and to save money  we had friends and family bringing us dinner during chemo weekends  and we had a gofundme set up in our name that raised enough money for us to have no medical debt   Sometimes  "looking after yourself" means letting others help you   You would help them if they needed it  right i think that's great26 27 was the age I felt a sense of urgency like "FUCK I'm an adult I NEED to do something with my life"   I realized that I can no longer use youth as an excuse and that I'm at that point where living with mom and dad is an embarrassment  I was embarrassed for myself as I had friends my age living the good life  traveling  buying nice cars  while living on their own   I really started taking my life goals more seriously and actually working towards those goals instead of thinking "when I grow up     " I'm 33 now and I'm just as accomplished as many of my friends who once surpassed me   Great thing about adulthood is that nobody can hold you back from what you want to do You're right  I don't try because women run away in disgust when they see me I believe that no one is ever "truly happy"  Even those without mental illness  Just ask yourself  what is happy   I just want to get to a stage in life where I have some good moments  And then I want to get to a stage where the good moments feel like they are worth waiting for through all the bad moments   I think this is possible  and that's what keeps me going I am so sorry this happened to you  but please do no internalize it this way   He killed himself  and that is tragic  but if he was in a mental state where being told he was loved by an individual is the tipping point between life and death  he was already on the edge  You did not bring him there  and lying to him about your feelings would not have helped anyone   I understand how you must feel  I experienced something similar when I was in high school  So I can promise you from experience  healing can be found here   I am sure this is very shocking and will take a while to get over  but please don't regard this as something you did or something that was in any way your fault  If you are starting to feel that way please reach out to someone you trust like a friend or a counselor to discuss it  Don't leave it bottled up   Stay strong OP  good luck Exactly  I enjoy buying tons of produce because I like voting with my dollar  That's good  Don't do anything stupid  You probably can't change what you are attracted to  but you can always refrain from doing things that will hurt others or hurt you  It is always good to have someone to talk to who can help you with this Did you make sure that the university is counting all the credits it is supposed to  Did you ask your adviser how the discrepancy happened  Did you really name your child that  My wife and I believe that he deserves to have his choice respected  regardless of his age  He's old enough to make his opinion known  It upsets him  Feeding him on a vegetarian diet isn't difficult  he's not a fussy kid and he eats pretty much anything put in front of him  except  y'know  animals   He is happy to drink milk and eat eggs  It's the start of developing his understanding of respect  and choice  and I think it's incredibly important we take him seriously   Late  but you are good parents  I think this is really important  It's a similar reason to why I always make sure I ask my niece and nephew before I hug them  They may be kids  but they're still people  They deserve to be treated as such  So tell your friends to stop talking to you about him and stop showing you what's on his FB  How do you know for a fact  Are you a medical doctor and have you done an MRI of the area  I think we both know that during interview there is usually a time when they ask about salary expectations and being underpaid is not fun but may be the only option given the lack of jobs  Oh  that's right   Silly me   Recipe for success  shower  lift  have "confidence"  and volunteer flip items that you buy on craigslist and sell them on ebay  I did this with golf clubs and made about 10k my senior year of highschool  You could make even more if you start with more than  200 in capital Yes Thanks  I'll try my best to hold on    Actually  I was trying to compare sex with food Woaaaah  Woaaaah man   Ok  there is some shocking stuff in there  And let me just say  John sounds like a frikkin asshole  Advice  fuck that guy No longer a factor  not a person of interest  You ain't got no time for that   Mary sounds like someone you are legitimately into  It sounds like you should legitimately ask her out  be open about how you feel and see what happens  Only she can actually tell you what she wants  If she is going to confess all these other things  respect her to be honest with you now   Or  if you really aren't feeling it and do not want any drama   cut down how much you speak to these people   Find some way to get regular showers  Not looking or smelling homeless will do wonders for keeping you from being harassed  and it'll keep you from getting fired for "unprofessionalism "You are welcome  I hope it helped bc she may overreact and think youre a fucking weirdo to be honest  or itll be too much pressure for her    What food is there left to eat when you remove wheat and dairy  I mean seriously  I tried going without both of those and I didn't make it 24 hours  What does your typical day's worth of food look like Seems like you're an incredibly insecure person who likes to take the spotlight off yourself by insulting others  Vanity and bitterness go hand and hand  It's a weakness of character that usually has a misery behind it  You are definitely not a Narcissist because you would feel no need to justify these behaviors  Everything you do  all the lies and drama point to having a vapid lifestyle   There's no drug that will make you mature and learn how to filter your feelings appropriately in social situations  Try reading some books on DBT therapy  The way I see it  your choice is not between her or him  But whether actually do something about your feelings towards Mary or not  John seems to have a toxic personality and I think you already know that some distance there is a must   Now   taking the leap with her will expose you to rejection  and maybe you should prepare for that  but I think your story with Mary needs closure anyway  Good luck UPDATE  RCMP and Royal Mail have got nothing so far  The RCMP noted it  mostly in case something happens in the future  but that's about it  Sorry mates  I guess we are never really going to find out   What's wrong with a body building website Hi friend    Yes  you do need to be honest  I'm proud of you for being able to identify that  However if working in this field for several years has taught me anything  it's that clients won't be fully honest unless they feel completely comfortable  There are sooooo many therapists psychiatrists out there  all with different models and techniques they use and all with different personalities  It seems to me that you haven't opened up completely yet because it hasn't been a perfect fit  Some things to consider   Do some reflecting on what it might take for you to feel completely comfortable with someone  Not really sure  Bring this up with your new therapist  We can help you sort through your thoughts    Be clear with us about your expectations about therapy  as well as what you have liked and not liked about professionals you've seen in the past  Like when we are direct and stern in an attempt to hold you accountable  Feel an insane increase in anxiety when someone asks 'why'  Expecting us to be able to fix what's going on for you  All of this is super helpful information and can facilitate discussion which may help increase the therapeutic bond    Ask us questions  Of course anything super personal might go unanswered  but if there's something specific you're curious about  specifically their professional background or if they have ever struggled with depression themselves  feel free to ask    Be honest with us  and with yourself   if you feel like it's not a good fit  Give it a few sessions  as it really takes time to build a relationship  but if you just don't see ever being able to open up with that person then let them know and ask for a referral  At that point they know you at least a little  and might be able to recommend someone who suits your needs expectations a little better    Let me know if I can be of any more help  The fact that you keep returning to therapy speaks volumes  and I'm sure that once you find a good fit things will absolutely start to be helpful  Best of luck to you xoI think maybe they meant vegetarian   as in vegan in relation to the diet and not the philosophyAfter experiencing a traumatic event and then living through those after effects like depression  anxiety  panic attacks and all the little things that go along with those o too have realized I'm very cynical  I don't seem to have a lot of feelings about daily events because it's just something to distract from dying  I don't have drive for school or any real excitement other than I made it through another day  It is some depression  or your minds way of telling you to keep going  and keep searching for someone or some thing to bring some peace  It's just a rough journey at times  young or not I think everyone goes through things and cynical thoughts  For me it was like this bubble I was living in where I thought nothing would or could ever happen to me suddenly popped  and now i hang around realizing there's a lot out there that I have to get through  I'm envious of people who drive carelessly or don't care what cigarettes do to them or just go about life  all while I'm like what's next  What do I have to get through now  Just gonna plug  r keto  Been on a ketogenic diet for a while now and am learning a lot about what is in foods  It's astounding the amount of things that have added sugar  I bought some beef sticks from the butcher the other day  no nutritional facts   had to throw them out after realizing corn syrup solids were listed as the second ingredient   Unfortunately  it's cheap to manufacture sugary foods  The notion that fat   bad is also still running rampant when most people don't know the difference between saturated and trans fats  I am so sick of seeing 'light' and fat free sour cream  yogurt  etc  that just have a ton of sugar added to replace the fatYes you should tell him  It's probably pretty difficult to find gay guys in the wild  and especially one who you know is gay and who you also happen to have a crush on  These opportunities don't come around often  so definitely go for it   However  I wouldn't wait for over a month to do it and then do it with a little poem about your feelings when you two don't even really talk much  Instead  I'd try to talk to him a bit more in class  then maybe after a week of just talking and getting closer  then catch him after class one day and say something like  "Hey  can I ask you something  Sorry  this is a bit awkward for me and I don't do it very often  but I've developed a bit of a crush on you in class and I was wondering if you'd be interested in going on a date sometime "  Bam   simple and to the point  If he's into it  great  You win  If he's not into it  then you know for certain where you stands  so you  stop daydreaming about him and start directing your efforts somewhere else  If he turns you down  it's not an "unbearably awkward situation" and it wouldn't be disastrous for your social skills  If anything  a rejection would likely do wonders for your social skills   As a guy  it's pretty much on me to ask the girls out  I was terrible at this in high school  and pretty clumsy about it in college  But by the end of college and then the time after I graduated  I got really good at it  The way to get good at asking people out is to simply get experience in it  Yeah  you might get turned down  but that's life   100  of the girls that I've been turned down by were always really nice about it  No one laughed in my face  gave me an "ew" look  or went around gossiping about me to their friends  Instead  they all said something along the lines of  "Aww  that's sweet  but I'm sorry I'm just not interested" with varying degrees of emphasis on how sweet I was or how sorry they were  At the point that you know they're not interested  that's when you dive in and say  "Hey   no worries if you're not interested  That's totally fine  completely understand  Just thought I'd give it a shot you know " Then smile and leave off with a quick  "Hey   I'll see ya tomorrow "  If you do the plan where you put thought and effort into your asking out "proposal" it's just going to feel like a bit much and a bit overwhelming to him  Whether he likes you or not  getting a poem written about you by someone you're not even dating is a little unbecoming to receive  Instead  keep it very casual  Make it easy for him to say "no" and walk away if he wants  and that takes a lot of the awkwardness away from the situation after the fact  It's  not awkward to be asked out and turn someone down  But it can be awkward to get this big gesture from someone about how much they like you  only to turn them down and then have to continue on with them knowing how they feel and how you turned them down   If you keep it casual  it's not a big deal at all  If you ask him out  it's a win win  Either he says yes  or you get some experience at growing a set of balls and asking guys out  haha   sorry I had to    If he thinks the transgender thing is gross  then hey  what are ya gonna do  You don't need to worry about the reasons he turns you down  all you need to know is if he is interested or not interested   If you do nothing  then it's a lose lose  You miss out on dating him  or you miss out on at least the experience of asking people out   A lot of this boils down to your fear of rejection  Everyone has a fear of rejection   it's natural to feel this way  In my experience  the only way to conquer this fear is to face rejection  Once you get some experience being rejected then you realize it's not the end of the world  People aren't going to be huge jackasses and make fun of you  but instead they're just going to politely turn you down and then you can move on  I understand you probably carry a bit more social anxiety that accompanies the judgement of being a transgender  but since you're able to share that with your class then I think really the only thing getting in your way is the standard fear of rejection   Go for it dude  Good luck Used to have the same problem  eventually I realized that every second has value because we are all going to die eventually  My best advice for you is stop being a brat and making excuses for yourself  I'm sorry about your childhood situation but by making excuses for yourself you're giving the people in your life who hurt you more power  the best thing you can do is succeed for yourself in spite of them  and that in turn will make you happy  Choose a direction for your life  even if it doesn't sound super enticing  nothing will when you're in your current state of mind  and get the hell after it  Create a meaningful life for yourself with real goals that isn't focused on people and memories  but instead on skills  interpersonal relationships that are non sexual  and goals  Hope this helps and best of luck Maybe say plant based instead of vegan  Veganism is a lifestyle that does not sum up just one's food diet  but all their ethical purchasing choices  It would have to affect everything from the clothing worn to the cleaning solutions purchased  entertainment pursued  no zoos   etc  Then I guess I'm more a hebephile than a paedophile because most time are girls about 12 13 years old but sometimes even are 8 years old  Anyways is not something concrete or specifically and I also feel atracted to girls near my age or few years older  Not sure if this will work  but you could tell him that your home is a "perk" from your job  Tell him you were renting  a pipe burst or there was a radon leak  and your boss is letting you use this fancy townhouse until you find a new place to live or until your landlord has the problem remediated  Claim the cars are your boss's cars and basically  just chalk it all up to having a great employer who's helping you out in a difficult situation    My guess is that he'll hang around for awhile and then you two will drift apart again  Maybe that's just how it goes with me  but whenever I've reconnected with old friends  we catch up and then move on with occasional texts or chats  Congratulations dude  But Jesus Christ  could you at least use periods and stop using paragraph long sentences I would just let them know that you are there for them and that you are sorry for their loss   I'd also go to at least the viewing hours to support your friend It's a memeDon't continue to give someone advice when they clearly don't want it  But that doesn't mean you have to support her in her choices  If you think she's behaving badly  tell her so and separate yourself from her  Tell her you're still her friend but that you can't be around her when she's making these horrible choices  Being adamant about taking medication for such a condition at exactly or almost exactly the same time daily is not unusual WTF  I am so mad at what OPs "friend" did  My eyes are tearing up just after reading this  After agreeing to deny it and then fucking him over like that  How can you even do that  I cant even comprehend how they could ruin someone's life like that  That's what they say  isn't it  Get a hobby where you can meet girls   I think OP has it down to a tee  But that's not healthy  You're broken up  and it's time for you to move on  He can do whatever he wants  No kids  So I've got some time to be more than a cog    He's not a bad guy  He's stealing from others  This really isn't a " no big deal   it's nothing"  Have you attempted framing each instance of avoidance as a "loss" to yourself  He's an academic  advisor  he gives you advice on what to do  but ultimately it all comes down to you to ensure everything is correct  I don't mean that in some sort of ethical sense  I mean in terms of most tertiary courses I've known of  ensuring you undergo the correct subjects ultimately falls on you so that they don't really have to take the blame for mistakes like these  They can fire or punish the advisor if they are at fault but they can't just make up a class   The bigger problem is that a course requires specific requirements you must satisfy  Its not a maybe or close enough or approximately x amount of subjects    Like most tertiary education must discuss with each other to ensure that the course you are taking is the same and meets the minimum requirements they expect from someone taking that degree  or else your degree loses meaning     Imagine for example the requirements to gain a degree for a course is to do 10 science courses  It doesn't matter what the advisor says  or any other mistakes  unless you fulfill that requirement  or equivalent through say summer school or credited from other unis  I don't think they can give you the degree   I do think it sucks that happened to you though and its a bit of a cop out to say well just do an extra semester but I just don't think they will credit you a whole subject over a mistake  You're more then welcome to try fighting it  I don't know what your university is like so I may be completely wrong  but I know at mine they'd tell me tough

incredible teacher  I was in high school at the time  who told me there were much better things later in life to look forward to  Over time and with lots of good discussion about philosophy  life and experiences  I learned there's so many other things to focus on instead of the little things that trip us up  Keeping my head active was key    I also really wanted to wear shorts without having to

happens   In life also we tend to always want more and more  it can be healthy  or it can be a disaster   This is the problem that I see      We all want to be happy    we all give different definition what means to be happy  Some people don't know     we all have different means to achieve that happiness  Some people don't know   Sounds like a two fold issue to me  someone with some experience in the things you're saying   1  you gotta heal yourself girl  Understand that a lot of what you are experiencing is possibly derived from the moment s  you were abused and your actions and behaviors are from that space  As someone who has been exposed to a lot of childhood trauma  I'm constantly in fight or flight  It takes effort to be present and work at it  I can elaborate if you're resonating with this  You have to work on yourself  Forget boys  girls  saviors  helpers  obviously doctors and professionals aren't what I'm talking about if they can be of help   Focus on you  What do you need  what do you want  For you  from you    2  ask yourself  what part of me  or who in me wants to stay in bed  And conversely  what part of me who in me wants to get up and do things  Forget shoulds or should nots  Forget guilt over what you have been doing when you think you should have been doing something else  Relax and go easy on yourself intellectually  Clearly you've needed rest and relaxation but your mind has guilt tripped you by contrasting it with what you think you should be doing  Love yourself anyways and accept the contradicting viewpoints but elaborate on them  Explore them  Where they come from  beliefs  people  ideas  etc   and why they have a feeling of power over you       If you are attracted to girls around your age then I don't see why you should even be concerned about this I will try at my own first with therapy  I will say somewhat like it's because of the stress or something but I really need my family to stay with me now  As I said they have spent many resources and time trying to raise me straight in spite of things and I'm not sure if they can handle this right now   Maybe later if I make improvements I will tell them but not now I think it's just a reflect on how some people text like they are illiterate or 12 year old girls   Personally  that is a big turn off Thanks a bunch  I got a lot to work with from this comment  I think it's going to be alcohol that fills that spotThat was my first thought as well  I didn't even get a reply on Tinder until over a year of using it on and off  and I didn't get a date until over two years A groups setting would be best I think   "Me and so   so are doing x fun thing  you wanna come "   Or if that isn't an option just something like "I would like to do x on Friday  would you like to go with me "   if she gives a hesitating stare interject "just as friends" This will likely be my birthday present to myself in 2018 at this rate Keep your head up  You may be the only person who regrets it  but ask yourself why  Was it really the act itself or the details of what happened that are bothering you  was it that you shared your husband with someone else  are there religious aspects to your regret  perhaps it's because you were the one who initiated it and that isn't something you would normally do  or perhaps you're just scared of the side of you that came out when all of your walls were down because if the pot and alcohol consumption    In a lesser situation most people have experienced that post masturbatory regret where you finish up  look at what you just came to and feel disgusted  but at the time your brain still reacted positively to it  This is very similar to that but there's always a reason why we have the disgusted reaction  Mainly things that go against a social norm  a taboo  something we feel people would judge us for  Others it's that we allowed ourself to cross a line we drew for ourselves and we start to question our morals and ideals    Sex is a weird thing  We can draw lines  say I would never do that  However when presented with the right situation  mood  intoxicants  our walls drop and we give in to a new experience  After those walls come back up and we have that post whatever regret and disgust  but generally it's not because of the activity itself but because we broke our own rules    Reflect on what happened  and mainly ask yourself if you enjoyed the experience  If you did  and everyone else did  no harm no foul  you may have just opened a door that you may enjoy more of in the future when you confront yourself about where you draw lines  If you didn't  than you learned threesomes are not for you and that's okay  because you don't have to do it again    At the end of the day it was a one time thing  reflect  breathe  and accept  Shit happens  if both your husband and friend are okay afterwards and your relationships remain the same then just accept that this happened and try to move on from it like you would any other unexpected event  LOL  awwwww  butt hurt widdle baby upset that others have different opinions  Loser  Fuck off  Try asking this question in  r gamedevredirect your obsession to yourself  make yourself the most important in your life  the center of your universe  care for yourself and make relationships with other people for YOUR benefit  not because you think they are perfect  Take care of your body  which means eat healthier and quit smoking those cigarettes  drop alcohol completely until you have a better control of your life  Find hobbies that you enjoy and that are productive hobbies  learning an instrument  a sport etc  rather than consumptive hobbies  television  social media  put away some of your paycheck each day as savings and use it when something that will actually make a major change in your life becomes available  Lastly  keep working on reading  Try every day for some period of time that gets longer as time goes on  ADHD is a real problem and condition  but it is not helped by our instant gratification society where web pages load in less than a second  it hard wired our attention span to be shorter and shorter until all you can do is consume  movies  tv shows  wiki pages etc I'm ugly in most of the the random pictures I see of me that unfortunately have ended up on facebook  so either I'm very unphotogenic for some reasons and look better irl or I'm just not that good looking   I swiped right on 1500 girls on tinder and got no real matches I'm so glad that worked for you  I've tried giving my knife to a friend but there are too many sharp things that I can use it didn't really helpYou have to try to come to terms with the fact that the person you like so much doesn't really exist  Meeting people and cultivating real relationships would help for sure  It sounds like a part of you is pretty lonely  Do you have a lot of friends From someone who had a conversation with you in another thread and downvoted you  the problem is not your spelling  The problem is your attitude  You come in blaming everything and everyone for your own mistake and get aggressive when someone brings up facts to prove this was your fault  You refuse to take responsibility for your own mistake and slowly become more and more of an aggressive troll while grasping at anything you could blame for what is solely your fault     people are using their raw talent and hardware horsepower to dive into people's post history for dirt  Once again  what are you even going on about  Looking at your comment history is as simple as clicking on your name  Anyone could do it on any device with a browser  Takes 5 minutes to get some very basic understanding of what your general tone is that is just enough to make an appropriate response    I have any small opinion that might contradict theirs in any way  It's not that your opinion contradicts anyone else  it's that it is wrong and you refuse to admit it even when everyone around you starts with bringing up facts and physical proof that it is you who are wrong  The whole thing could've been done in a much more polite and civil way if you didn't start off with sounding so arrogant and close minded  Your response is not to change your point of view  but to get defensive and aggressive progressively until you bail  still holding on to your opinion  And you expect your comments to change anyone else's opinion while clinging on to yours no matter how wrong it is   Work on your attitude towards other people's opinions and acceptance of theirs  Be more open to accepting your mistakes and learning from them instead of turtling up and refusing to accept facts that don't repeat what you want to hear and you'll see the change in how people respond to you   And stop looking for someone to blame  First it was Sony for you making an uninformed purchase  Then it's Reddit's voting system for getting downvotes on your comments that were nothing but defensive without any reasoning and simply aggressive towards those who were trying to help you understand your mistake and learn from it  But you clearly do let him get to you if you're asking your friends to show you his posts and you're posting on Reddit about him  What kind of advice are you even looking for  The only right thing to do is to move on and never talk to him again  If you tries to contact you  don't respond  If he talks shit about you to other people  say "I don't want to hear about it  He's just making drama " Haha  please tell me the way you talk in real life is exactly like you type  AND that

hope so too  They're all incredibly talented For the majority of the year nobody sees the scars because I hide them  they're on my shoulder   They only see them in the summer when my shirt comes off and ever then I make excuses and lie my ass off  Only a few people have recognized what they are and fewer have actually tried to help  I think it amazing that you've found someone that loves you  that gives me a lot of hopeis recycling ever bad hey good luck  I started my first ever psychoactive prescription yesterday  and already seen side effects  but I will be alert vigilant and continue and make it to 3 weeks appointment back to the GP  Its scary  but I'm going to try my best and give it a fair shot  Go back and talked to your advisor again  Sometimes they know that an "elective" you took actually counts for a requirement  but only if the requirement is not filled  That might've happened in your case   If not  I don't think there's much you can do about it  Advisors make mistakes too sometimes  The only thing you could really do is let your advisor know so they can update their information and check on other students who they might've given wrong information to  Neither of those things have anything to do with sugar Thanks for the advice I thought this would be the place to give this advice but then after I posted I noticed people normally come here with their problems looking for advice Not creepy  but a bit goofy   She seems pretty cold   Just move on   Not too big a deal   All of the remaining vegetables  fruits  and meats probablyNah I didn't mean it that way  It was really late where I am from  and I knocked out lolI've tried gaming but it only delays the stress for me  putting it off till later  I also work really late so when I get home my parents are asleep  It's great that you've found something that works for you  what do you think the government wants your organs for  to built an altar to the heathen gods of old  they want it for science  or to donate to other people Do it  Since you're posting here about it  you want to do it  so just do it  Now come on  I know looks play a great role when it comes to attractiveness  but respect  I have made the experience that people start respecting you once you respect yourself  That means not to beat yourself up and whine over everything in the presence of others  Trust me on this  We are just like wolves in that regard  The alphas are the ones that are calm  stand tall and defend their position If you lost your SS card there's a process to get a new one  I would start it ASAP since it takes a while  Sometimes I'll just heat up the backside of my knife and burn myself  I feel like that's safer then cutting  I'm really happy you found something that works for you wow thanks  i really needed to hear this  hopefully i can put at least some into practice   hobbies wise  i play guitar four hours a week but have always lumped this together with the other bumming type activities i do at home  i used to volunteer regularly over a span of two years but it's getting increasingly difficult to find motivation for that these days   Thanks we were too  Thanks  I am also a junior in HS  I feel like before I send something kinda risky I should take so time to think about a reaction  And you're right  people do always forget about it  Thank you  Btw my day isn't just bad because of that  I scratched someone's car  almost dented their trunk   I wasn't in the car   I also broke another kids TV  I have never ducked up so bad  Thankfully I broke a close friends TV and and his family laughed it off as it was a spare  I'm still payment for it though  Thanks for the support Is it really warm  soft and wet like they say I don't really have anyone in my life that is physically near me that could help me talk through things   Stop answering her and talk to her friend instead  So her response to let's talk was "Why should I"  Jesus  you can't get blood from a stone  man   I'm sorry I think people know  they just don't care  I thought maybe telling them that I'm a lesbian and trying to introduce my girlfriend to them just before I leave might be a good idea   This doesn't sound like a very good idea  It puts you and your girlfriend at risk  It also makes your girlfriend into a scapegoat for your family   your family will look for someone to blame and she'll be an easy target   Just leave and tell them when you and your gf are safely away Thank you I appreciate it  I guess this is really all you can do in these situations   Thanks for the update OP I'm going note at first that I was always invited to party smoke pot  drink and so on  I have several friends at school who invited me every time there was a party  but I refused to go because I'm not a party animal  Even now  as someone your age  I drink alone in my solitude but I don't party  I don't do drugs at all    I thought that I really needed to get out and hang out with people  but I realized that I tired quickly of clubs and bars and parties and the like  As fun as it might seem  it's not always all it's cracked up to be  First things first  I would ask yourself whether you  need  to home out a lot and stuff to be happy  If you do  then you should totally contact some people    It's easy to reconnect with old friends  You just send them a text  facebook message  or whatever  "Hey  long time no see  how're you " Then ask them to hang out  You never know what people are doing with their lives  I've reconnected with old friends before  Sometimes they've changed drastically  Sometimes they haven't changed at all    It doesn't hurt to try  Sometimes you get somewhere  Sometimes you don't  You already have like zero contact with them  so the worst case is the status quo This really helped me  Thanks Thats why I am an organ donor   But I decided that   No one decided that for me and said "say no if you don't want us to do it"   Congrats  I'm in a similar boat  What are some of the open ended questions you had success with Hmm that can be risky as well right  just not a good fallout game   What aspect of Fallout 4 isin't great I agree with those who suggested that you talk to a professional   The following might sound corny but it is true   the innocent child was violated twice and the older you is still carrying around the scars that the child self endured   So think of yourself as having two sides   the angry adult part and the injured child part  WHO DID NOT DO ANYTHING WRONG    When you seek help  this should be the approach by the therapist doctor   People might tell you to grow up and put this behind you but until that part of you is healed  the whole you will not heal   By no means am I discussing split personality   I am just saying that within each of us is the wounded child and it is our responsibility to resolve the painful issues   I hope this makes sense OP I'm guessing the small company is your first serious job in your career     You have to look out for yourself     Your company is just trying to turn a profit for the owners and if they like you enough to treat you well  then they should like you enough to let you go  assuming that's what's best for you    If you start at entry level wages and make 3  raises every year  it won't be long before inflation outpaces you and a new entry level hire  at the same small company  makes   more   than you   If the small company can't survive without you  it's time they learn how   You can still leave on good terms I you give them a full  or more than  two weeks notice and leave behind written guides on how to do your specific job   That's what I did and they still loved me enough to hire me back for remote freelance work once in a while   However let's be realistic   You are not guaranteed a job at the new place   Your resume is short   One of the key reasons you  should  take it is for the experience for your next career move   Most folks agree 2 5 years is a good amount of time to stay at a company  without much job title growth    You shouldn't let yourself get complacent in one place   Once you try someplace new you'll have some better comparison to determine what makes a good boss etc   Yes  there are many important factors  beyond money  to consider before changing jobs  but how can you really tell how good or bad it is anywhere with a comparison   Here's a decent article on the subject   http   money cnn com 2016 04 12 news economy millennials change jobs frequently Playing guitar is a great hobby  Volunteering is an amazing thing to do as well  but it has to be because you want to and because it makes you feel good to give back to less fortunate people or beings  like puppies  and not because you feel like you have an obligation  Especially avoid the cigs  alcohol  and drugs if that's something you do  they're temporary band aids that are hurting your body and mind  Plus just think of all the other things you could be doing with all the time and money you spend on them  Try adding maybe another hobby or two to guitar as well  and try to find groups with relate able people who you can talk to about your hobbies  Hope i was able to help   He will appreciate it more if you are open and honest   Legend of Zelda  Are you talking about LoZ   Breath of the wild  honestly it's not really worth worrying about as much as you might think  i failed my maths but still got into college without a single hiccup  and within the month i started my course i got offered a job  GCSE's are really over hyped  you'll be fine as long as you do them

 you can blame reddit admins for making life of people like you just a little bit shittier    Yeah you can feel the warmness on your dick its freaking amazing Why would you keep messaging someone who wasn't responding  If she ghosted before  why would you be surprised that she didn't respond positively   Dude  is this is like what kids do where even negative attention is still attention 30 million really isn't much money nowadays  You can live a modest life and not work but your luxury spending and paying a staff of 3 seems outrageous  If you won right out of school then you need to last around 60 years with that money  I would recommend that you start a business and work for yourself  Not only is it the common sense thing to do  it's also going to give you purpose  Not to mention your "secret" status wont have to stay secret any longer  I've seen people  lottery winners  with way more money blow it or get screwed over by bad investment advice and who are also much older than you   Source  Wall Street investor turned entrepreneur  Well  unfortunately I don't get to see her stare  like I said our interactions are mostly online  I don't see her in a daily basis like I do with my other friends  that's why I wanted to hang out with her more and rebuild the friendship  I rarely see her and would like to change that  And I really mean it  I'm not just trying to make her change her mind  I'm over it  I really wanted to fix the impression she has of me and get closer to her  It's really easy to say no online  specially after what we've been through  but like I said I'm serious about it  I want to improve our friendship  nevertheless I need to make a cautious approach because I might have to convince her of my change  A group hang out would be good  but she would probably not feel comfortable around my friends and I didn't want to put the weight in her to have her plan something with her friends and invite me  Also  she would have to spend a day with me and she could feel uncomfortable about it  I wanted to take it easy for now and slowly regain her trust  that's why I thought about something as simple as grabbing a coffee  We can chat like we usually do  I can show her that I'm happy with the friendship and it doesn't have to be a long hang out  she can simply leave whenever she feels like  considering the coffee shop is nearby her house   If it goes well we might go out for a coffee some other time or start planning bigger hang outs like beforemessage me asapWell  they obviously don't find us attractive  What else could it be I have learned one thing in my life and that's "if you get mad you lose"  Simply put when you get mad  you suffer and you make others suffer so that makes you look bad  I'm still at home at 26  Three years into my career  third time filling in for a maternity leave  I often feel like a man child as well when I see some of my buddies nab higher paying gigs and move out  But only a select few have even been able to do so  It's the curse of our generation inheriting a tire fire of an economy  you are not alone Who knows  I have no idea why I posted that  LmaoYeah I tried Tinder and got bots and women looking for sugar daddies  guess it proves I am just a loser who will die alone    As everyone else is saying if you get into it time feels faster and it takes your mind off everything not if you do it the correct way  you just need to become an expert on a niche subject so that you can detect fakes and identify the condition and quality of the items that you are getting  You can assess demand and prices for a product on ebay by looking at the completed listings for a keyword and it will tell you what did and did not sell  as well as the prices that sold items went for  With a couple hours of research its really easy money  i highly recommend it It sounds like you need to get away from all of these toxic people  I agree 100  with third paragraph    Comedy posts on this sub make me laugh hard It's a copy of something I wrote approximately two days ago I am so sorry  Anecdotally  I once read an article written by someone with post concussion syndrome who was helped by neurofeedback  you may want to look into that Same  It amazes me how much men here idolize tall guys but that has never helped me in my life  And I guess I'm kind of attractive and that has never gotten me anywhere either  If I weren't so shy and may be had just an ounce of luck at some point  then I wouldn't be in such a sad state  The grass is always greener I guess   You're pretty great  Really appreciate this Yeah you're right  He's having a really rough time right now and we're going on holiday with some friends in a couple weeks but after things have cooled off I'll talk to him  Wish this could be more easy   I'd say it's normal  You probably don't share as much about your routines as you did before  Talk to your SO about it    and maybe find some hobbies or new things to do to keep it interesting if you're worried It only counts when it's someone they find really attractive  I'd be glad to be somebody's first choice period  And for some extra clarity about my dad  he has a giant charitable spirit  if he thinks someone is in need  he will do everything in his reach to help said person  be it friends or family  and some people will take note of this and exploit it  as it happened before with relatives and friends of him This is debatable   If you're wise enough to know that you'll never be complete  and that growth and struggle are necessary to thrive  then you might be able to achieve an ideal self that incorporates such incompleteness You sir  are living the dream  One day I hope to have enough to that I can spend out my days collecting art If like you you have looks  I swiped right one every woman for months  don't even have any friends and spent the holidays alone even when I asked not to be   do not give out false hope because some of us will never be in that posistion  I think you need to not just to "bring it up" but start working with him on getting healthier   Mindless snakcing  Replace chips with almonds  or dried fruit   Keeps saying he'll go to the gym but doesn't  Don't nag him to go  ask him to work out with you   Expressing that you are worried about his weight won't do much to build self esteem or desire to change It'll more then likely drag him down and just make him feel shitty Which then feeds into a negative feedback loop   Ya'll are a team  and weightloss happens more in the kitchen then the gym  It'll be difficult if you don't work together to improve  Why don't we count FA   That's why we are here bro   Nobody takes us into account  we are just a throwaway character in someone else's story It only counts if they find the other person desirable I'm curious  you mentioned that you still weren't being upfront about your emotions  Does your tinder profile reflect your shyness  We're you upfront with her about your lack of experience confidence That person thinks that they are better than you and therefore  in their mind  they deserve better  They know exactly what they are doing to get attention  They get on Facebook and say " I'm alone and nobody loves me wahhhhh" and yet they are baiting people to notice and respond to stroke their own ego  If they really felt that nobody cared  then they wouldn't be posting on Facebook because they would truly believe that nobody cared  It's that simple Has it completely dried up  The first part is 'catching up'  sharing points of view or interests  Mutual discovery  There's a lot of ground to cover     After a while though   you're caught up  You have a solid grip on how the other person thinks  what they like  what their routine is  And a lot of the day  work or school  is routine   Not a lot of stuff there you have to cover more than twice  Conversations get shorter because there is less new ground to cover    So while it's important to stay on the same page and make time for conversation  it's a totally normal thing for that new relationship energy to mellow out and mature into something deeper and more comfortable  Not all things need saying  and not all silence is a void that needs to be filled  Being together over the long term means sharing all kinds of moments  quiet  contemplative  exciting and serene  It's okay to just be     Super normal  Super healthy  Nothing to worry about  Very inspiring Ted talk  I hope one day I'll learn these skills like you have done  I also agree that they should teach social skills  like they teach Maths at school for people who do not develop them like me First response was a joke  none of what I said is illegal How would he  The guys who he scammed also will be reporting himIf you like MMO's  give Elder Scrolls Online ago   took me awhile but I'm really enjoying it even without friends to play with  From what I've read  this is fairly common in rape victims   it can be a way to extend denial about the rape  to help you pretend that it didn't really happen    I've never been raped  which honestly surprises me given how many women I know who have been  but one of the main things that many of the people I've talked to try to do is blame the rape on themselves  because that gives them some sense of control over the event  It's because we want to believe in a world where things happen for a reason   one of the scariest things for humans is to recognize that we are all incredibly vulnerable  and that sometimes we have absolutely no control over what happens to us  We want to believe in the "just world fallacy"   that we live in a place where everything has a logical cause and effect  Many people would honestly rather blame themselves when something bad happens to them  than accept that we live in a world where bad things can happen to good people through no fault of their own  If bad things can only happen when you do something wrong  you weren't careful  you smoked drank too much  you wore the wrong thing  you were in the wrong neighborhood  then we have the ability to protect ourselves   https   en wikipedia org wiki Just world hypothesis There has to be mutual attraction  not a one sided infatuation The dude is 32  He would fuck a chair if it offered  His time for standards is over  He needs to just have one healthy relationship with the opposite sex  Then he can start being pickyThanks for the advice  I really appreciate it  I'll post an update when a bit of time passes Struggling with internal issues  Why not   zoidberg   downvote and not voice your troublesthe settlements  the dialogue options  dumbed down decision making  oversimplified karma system  bugs and glitches still galore  quests aren't as complex as earlier games  of course I don't own the game  Just played it on a friends PC and for some reason it didn't quite feel like new vegas or fallout 3I could be very wrong  never tried it before  but I've been told to always ask after they've offered the job    So usually you'll have the interview  they'll mull over who they want to choose  Then lets imagine they pick you  they will call you or email and tell you they're offering you the job  This is the point where you can accept the offer or reject or ask to talk more about salary    This is mostly because they've already picked you  so now you have a bargaining position  usually they'll really want you at this point  so asking for more could possibly work at this point  usually more so then the interview stage   You'll also be able to say you are very interested in accepting the offer and would like to know the full details of salary  holidays etc to make your decision  then maybe discuss from there   Though theres always a chance they'll just reject you  but usually its much harder since they've already offered you the job lol If that's what you're looking for  lifting is definitely right for you  I gained about 25 pounds from lifting  I was really skinny when I started  and I can tell you it gives you a lot of confidence   I'm still not particularly strong  but due to low body fat it looks alright  It's a great feeling to be able to fill T shirt sleeves with your arms  You will feel very confident when meeting other guys that are "smaller" than you  Try r gainit  And don't be scared of getting "too big"  I guarantee that won't happen  It feels really good to be strong and lifting is an awesome hobby but don't expect it to increase your chances with women  It didn't for me and generally doesn't for anyone else I feel the same way  man  I have been with my company for almost two years and HATE taking sick days  I always feel guilty and anxious the whole day  Of course  when I go into work sick  however  my boss gets mad and tells me to go home so I don't get more people in the office sick  I just try to remind myself it is better for the company and everybody who works in my office if I just stay home  Veganism is a set of morals and a lifestyle choice  The diet is called plant based  It would be much better to say you are mostly plant based with a little bit of animal protein as that undermines the meaning of vegan   That's the agony of FA  you can't just stop wanting companionship or a relationship    Well put  It's a goddamn curse I was swooning yesterday for sure  I mean like wtf are you supposed to say when they ask "Why "   I usually just shrug and smile without saying a word Lucky husband  Down vote this comment if you think all wives should have FFM threesomes with their husbands  thank you so much    that was

great start  I would slice your backstory into a few keywords  add the word 'therapist'  the name of your city  and drop the whole mess into your favorite search engine  Read up a few of the therapists' websites  and add subtract keywords until it feels like the therapist knows what they're talking about  Then call and visit a few of them until you think you've found one that is 'good enough'    You can work through them and your GP to get most medications that might help  They can usually refer you to a psychiatrist should more complicated meds be necessary  I wouldn't go to a psych directly   I've been that route and they seem to just throw meds at you hoping one will stick without trying to understand where your mental state came from   My experience with PPO's is that they are pretty cheap when in comes to mental health  They have very few psychiatrists or psychologists on their list  and the ones that are there are extremely busy and seem to prefer quantity over quality  Very few therapists accept insurance  and PPO's in general allow payment only for a specific  generally short  time period This is your parents' fault  They are enabling her by not punishing her and not making her take responsibility for her actions  You need to sit them down and talk to them and tell them how this is making you feel and ask them what they plan to do to get her to stop stealing  It's so disgusting that in some places women can't get in trouble for rape  I'm so sorry  friend  With time things will feel better and I wish you the best on your way to being okay   Prepare an official letter of resignation and go in and tell your boss that you've appreciated working there but you're moving on to another position  Make sure you give at least 2 weeks notice Originally I wasn't going to say it but    no  he doesn't have great aesthetics   That thing has the dead eyes of an animal   It's disgusting to look at     You can look at it and see that whatever is inside of it isn't human   This is what a  handsome male human face looks like  http   worldversus com img george clooney jpg  Just work to the best of your abilities   Use common sense on things that you're not 100  on  and the things that you have no clue   Ask and then retain that knowledge  It may also help to research your position on your off time to get a better idea of your tasks   Otherwise   Just fucking relax man   As your co workers have said  No one expects you to know everything in your first week   Hell  even in your first couple of months  No matter where you work  it's always going to be the same as NO education can prepare you 100  for any field    Just try your best  ask questions and learn a little more each dayI'm living with my boyfriend and we are financially stable  I feel bad for her honestly  it's ridiculous that my dad would never tell herEverything in moderation  Including moderation Try this book  a philosopher's notes  It's like a massive summary of all the great books divided into pint sized pdf's you can swallow within a few minutes  I hope that will help you with the healing part  I feel your pain  in a way  But that's a really lazy way to see the possibilities out there  There's life outside of wheat and dairy    Remove bread  pasta  pizza  add sweet potato  normal potato  white rice  vegetables  keep the burgers  fish and so on    And do think seriously about doing it for your sake  A lot of minor health issues can simply go away by eliminating wheat  dairy and excessive sugar  A lot serious health issues can also improveFor them  being someone's first choice is less of a challenge than us being any choice that someone would make    She probably just posted in hopes that some super hot dude would notice  Or she had someone in mind It can  depending on the context   Usually someone would say "a visual" when used to mean the same as graphic  For example  "I don't understand this by just reading the text  I need a visual "  If someone says "visual" without the "a" in front of it  they're usually using "visual" as an adjective to describe the method by which something is being experienced   in this case with sight Ever since I moved out almost 8 years ago  I've been using a 42" TV as my computer monitor  along with a wireless keyboard and mouse on my couch and haven't looked back   This lets you put on a movie or video and watch it on the big screen  as well as gaming on it  If you don't want to do this  You can get an android streaming system or build one using a rasberry Pi I always find it weird when Asian people use English names  I feel it more appropriate when people introduce themselves with a full name and provide shorter and easier pronounciation  Yep  I've massacred myself  Hugely overweight  Grotesque body  Crohn's Disease   major surgery 5 years ago  latent since but just waiting for it to return Sex barely comes with the guilty feelings associated with watching porn and when done with the right person  at its worst its light years better than the best porn video  Well that is pretty pricey but I have a lot of disposable income now my job is starting to pay me pretty well and I'm too much of a pussy to get a girl illegally and pay less and she was high quality in my opinion seriously amazing face  amazing body she was super tight and she gave me the girlfriend experience Look  again  I don't have a panacea  I just offered my own experiences to try and impart some perspective  You'll have to be willing to try  anything  to escape that level of depression  though  and unfortunately  that's despite years of no success or however long you've already tried  There's no workaround    Have either of you tried any kind of research based therapy  Meds did and do absolutely nothing for me  DBT  on the other hand  was huge  It comes with a much more regimented methodology than "let's talk about your problems and go in circles for an hour a week " It is specifically designed to give you the tools to reshape your own perspective on yourself and your depression  Things like this are another option that most people don't even know about    Therapy's not even the only option to begin with  though  You need to analyze your life circumstances and figure out what's contributing to your depression  then formulate a plan to change it  All of this is easier said than done  but you need to have a little bit of gumption to get this done  because nothing is going to give it to you  You have to be willing to fight for yourself if you want to feel better  and frankly  if you've been trying for at least a year  you certainly are perseverant  so this is within your reach  I think I've just grown numb to it  to me the rejection hurts more than the loneliness  so I've pretty much stopped even dreaming about it First of all congratulations  I've been working my ass off since my parents decided that stealing 3k and kicking me out at 16 was a good idea  The debt thanks to that pretty much stopped me from going to college and doing anything I planned to do since a place to live on £4 an hour was all I could manage  Still trying to recover from it now thanks to council    That being said the solution is pretty simple  Meet your friend away from your home  Just go to a pub or restaurant instead   Never met a guy yet who wants to visit a house that much that he will turn down a restaurant or pub trip  Mm  yeah  They fucked up and clearly don't reciprocate your desire to maintain your friendship  To keep in contact with those guys is like putting strings on a corpse to make a shitty smelly marionette  As a short term solution  look up "compression shirts" on amazon  You should be able to get one for  15 20  and they work wonders for making you look "normal"   You have to do something to break yourself out of the cycle you're in  Getting out  getting a job  going back to school  working out to "fill in" some of the loose skin you may still have from losing weight    doing   something   positive with your life will get you into a position where you can solve whatever problem you're having    If you can't make that first step  things will never get better  So if what's holding you back is embarrassment  solve that one thing   even if it's a "quick fix"   Then move on to the next  and the next  and eventually   whether that means surgery or whatever   solve it permanently   If you can't find the motivation to do this  your problem isn't gyno   it's more than likely depression  See the comment from plzsendhalp I don't think he put me in danger  but he is intentionally trying to keep things from us because he is ashamed of his son  We have talked about it a few times but it always ends with him saying something like "you don't know what it's like to be a parent" as an excuse for not cutting my brother off completely  he moved back to this state so he could bum off my parents for money and shelter  he's living in my grandparents old house in the middle of nowhere and they gave him one of their cars   despite this  i still love my dad and i would feel extremely conflicted about cutting him off  I wonder if its easier to get into civil engineering  I do know that software engineering at my uni has the same subjects as civil for the first year and a half so might cut things down a bit in subjects    I don't know anything about architecture  you mean buildings not computing architecture right   but I don't think your too old  Architecture strikes me as one of those areas where you'd probably hire the older guy then the young guy because they seem like they have more experience lol  Like I find it harder to get say an architect who's 23 as opposed to one who's like 30s    I don't think its ever too late to study anything  the bigger question is  is it worth it  Like whats the job opportunities like there  My understanding is that architecture are usually people with A LOT of experience  so how easy will it be to get that experience for you  Will money be a problem considering you'd need to do a few more years at uni  Also how easy is it to get into architecture at your university  And are you able to still study like you used to be able to  I know some people lose that study feel after uni    I'd imagine  I have no idea  that you'd find it hard to get experience out of uni  but if you're able to get through that hump  you'd probably be at say mid to low 30s  year old  and working in architecture fairly well as you have that experienced looking age lol Basically the stuff that happens and is done in a lot of porn isn't realistic  As in REAL average person sex is different  Just an example is they tend to over exaggerate certain actions to make it appeal more visually to certain audiences My father constantly bullies me about my appearance and my status   My mother has given up and doesn't say anything at all  doesn't even do the typical "Do you have a girlfriend" questioning anymore   I'm pretty much an embarrassment and will probably eat a bullet soon If I am mental  they are aliens  They can read my effin'  mind  THEN yes  They have a solid reason for this whole issue  I act pretty normal  follow basic ettiquete  It seems like  however  my skin doesn't   I don't hear voices Dude  not really the advice that I was looking for   Thanks tho   And don't worry  I have a financial advisor who helps me handle my 1 5 mil a year income   And three staff  Not really a lot  I have a housekeeper  who cleans and does householdy stuff  a chef who shops and cooks  and a chauffeur gardener    Extravagant spending  Nope  After the initial purchases  I have been saving at least 1 25 mil a year the last two years   I do spend a lot  but my income is high enough that it s negligible  Have you ever considered one of the less heavyweight meds for anxiety   e g  buspirone  Doctors are far more willing to prescribe these over benzodiazepines like Xanax  In fact I've had doctors pointedly telling me that they will not prescribe benzo's to anyone  ever due to their abuse potential Great  Thanks  Give me your account number  Sounds like I will be taking a trip to Thailand someday I think we are done  Everybody is gonna be someday   No snowflake is escaping   Whether one gets 3468 women a day isn't a problem for our frendie there All that I have to say is  well done  Congratulations on achieving your goals and leading the life you want  As for your so called friends and their attitude  they're living proof that just moving to another place doesn't make you more worldly  small town mentality is a thing and sometimes it runs way too deep to be completely eradicated My coffee requires sugar  So that will never end That person wishes she was someone's first choice  We're not even on the list of choices or if we are we're so far down that we'd never get picked anywayAre you asking what to play it with or where to get content from  For content  Netflix might be a good option if you have good internet   For playing  Chromecast or android box are good  a lot of smart tvs have youtube netflix and stuff built in as well   Theres always the option of Plex if you have your own media files and want to share it   In my country theres actually a free to air app you can use with some tvs and android boxs so could just use internet   edit  if you get a big HDMI cable  you could probably just plug your computer in and watch things off it  you can find streams of most things on the internet though some arn't strictly legal You are new to this job and new at working full time  People aren't expecting you to know everything right away  why would they  You are a beginner  Sometimes it takes days  weeks or months to become an experienced beginner and then on to more experienced levels of skills   Take notes  ask questions  interview people and either record what you find out with your phone or take pictures or videos  Go online and find out things and take notes  You can use apps like OneNote or EverNote to save what you find online   You are an "entry level" employee but if you give yourself permission to make mistakes and take time learn  you'll be fine Well  just out of pure curiosity  tell us  How did it go    Wow  have no answers but sorry your thread got downvoted  seems like a legit query to me  Look here  u frampoose  If the OP assumes fault  then there comes blame  even if it is merely self blame  If she goes around blaming herself  she sets the seeds for her own potential depression  The best thing for her is to move on and live life  and by not pointing fingers or assuming fault  she can do that  The alternative is to start throwing fault and blame  and the only outcome that does not end up pinning the fault for a suicide on a living person is to pin it on the dead  Its rather impolite to vilify the memory of the dead  not to mention just adds insult to injury to anyone else who loved that guy  like his mom    So no  I stand by what I said that it is not about pointing fingers  and most importantly  it is not op's fault  She had no way to know the bf would do himself in  that is why she is coming to us to ask how to deal with this  She needs to grieve  but she also needs to be able to absolve herself of fault  self blame and the eventual self guilt  The easiest way to do this is to simply short circuit fault and keep self guilt from ever arising  No  You're not screwed at all  Just tell her the truth  but be nice about it     I'd say something like "hey  sorry for being so straight forward  but i get the feeling that you're very interested in me  i just wanted to tell you that if that's the case  i don't really have the same interest in you  i don't mean to hurt your feelings or anything  but i just thought i'd better be honest with you and rather tell you earlier than later  i'm sorry if i made it seem otherwise "  I wouldn't even remotely mention her friends  You're not into her  that's all she needs to know  The rest is none of her business It's actually fine  Me and my girlfriend were like this exactly  We have now been together 5 years and are still happy   You get used to the person more when you are together and things that used to be interesting to talk about become regular things  You won't ever run out of things to talk about don't worry  Don't think too much about some meaningless  deep  thing someone posts on normiebook This is a guy you haven't really seen for a long time  and even then you stopped talking under fairly negative circumstances  Why invite to your house at all  Can't you just grab some beers at a pretty low key place  Or coffee  If he wants to stay in London just suggest a hotel  say you don't have space at the minute    You're not really lying  you ARE in investment it just so happens that you've invested your own money  I would like some things to change  but social skills consists of more than parties to me  My main concern was to get by in my job and in university and I do that just fine now  Thanks for the suggestion  Worth looking into with antiques I supposeMy grandfather and great grandfather would pour sugar into their coffee until it was like liquid candy  They're both wood workers and live to the ripe old ages of 95 and 98  My father is still going at 78 and enjoys his coffee with the same amount  I think I will be fine I love this comment  me being aggressive in my posts might have to do with the fact that yes i am arrogant  But me being aggressive in a handful of comments was easy  simple   blunt  I did learn from my mistakes but did not comment on those who did prove me wrong  What its the use of commenting with positivity to a thread that already sees you as black and white  Oh and i made another thread later that night after I got to experience ESO with a free trial  I did come back to apologize to a few  delete my thread to prevent agrrivating more people  My review of the game was positive  Im not blaming reddit for my trolling habits  I'm merely stating that the karma system is censoring my opinion  one that is new and imperfect  I haven't even been around long and I know so little  Every small comment positive or negative can still ruin a person's day  That is what bothers me  the fact that a person with a android phone  two years of bed ridden sickness  no social life  failing english skills can affect the community of many is such bad ways  My opinion is still my opinion and its one of the few things that defines me as a single identity Don't stop  you're doing so great  I'm still trying to get my binge eating under control so seeing that you've made it past 90 days is inspirational to me  Keep it up  I'm rooting for you Write down everything that you're feeling and as soon as you meet your therapist  give it to them  Tell them what it is and try and explain everything yourself and use that as a failsafe if you clam up Try and save up a monthly amount of income as if you are paying rent   Seeing that you saved up 10 000 dollars while living with your parents will feel alot better than seeing that you spent 10 000 dollars to live in an apartment   I'm actually having this issue too  and what worked for me was simply acting like a man  feel confident in yourself that "you are a man" and eventually everyone will notice your masculine traites  An example was I work with a bunch of older men  and when I first started working I was looked down a lot and a good chunk of my work was second guessed  but I kept my grind going  picked up shifts  a good man works hard doesn't he   kind  humble yet confident enough to speak up  on more than one occasion me and another gentlemen have had arguments and I have always spoken to him right even though he was an older man and calling my experience into play   I beloved you're still coming into yourself  besides a good man could care less about other people's opinions  You know you got a pair of balls  and you know you'd fight for what's right and you know you'd fuck a girl like how she needs it  it really doesn't matter what everyone else thinks bro No  That's a myth You should reply to her post  Fuck it  you only live once You might be sensing the disconnect between people who want "a relationship"  as an abstract goal and as an end in itself  and those who just want to find people the enjoy the company of with mutual care and love  For many people who are "in on it"  belonging to the second category  relationships are a means to the end of sticking with someone you want to be with  not an end in themselves    And once you are in a relationship  you have a whole set of other problems to deal with  and at that point the "in a relationship" vs  "not in a relationship" line is not as clear or as important of a distinction Ditto friend  Hope you find something better  Am still there now  And it wasn't even a relationship  we weren't even dating  Just a fling I was trying to turn into one  It sucks  Especially when you start looking forward to stuff you want to with them etc  Can't get him out of my head either  Anxious for the day I don't wake up depressed and spend every minute in a sad ass fog wishing he was still into me What sort of work do you do  What are you interested in as a career  Don't limit your responses  what can you see yourself doing in 5 years   Not sure  What do you absolutely don't want to do  There is no one right way to pick a career but interviewing people about their jobs and what they do if a good way to get first person information   I cried because I had no shoes until I met a man that had no feet It's still stupid and petty  a mandatory camping trip sounds like hell on earth to me  when can you go home   edit  I say this as a person who likes camping  but being forced to go camping would suck I've been trying to get my mom to eat less sugar  It really is snuck into everything these days  Personally I 100  cut it out except for fruit  To be fair  I downvoted him just because he got laid  He seems to think if he blocks them  he can't be reported  Don't know if there is any truth to that thoughDo you mind paying for everything when he comes to visit  even if you keep your cover intact   Cause I'm willing to bet you will end up footing the bill   Honestly  your friend sounds like someone who just wants a free trip to London  especially considering he has been out of your life for so long until now I like how it seems like when you're typing this post up it's a run on sentence I don't see many punctuation marks at all in the sentence it seems to flow like my hypothetical teenage sister's periodGive it time and force yourself to occupy your thoughts with other things   Constructive things Hate to say it mate  but almost 20 isn't exactly a grown man   You won't get what you are after until you  are in your early thirties I'm afraid  Yeah  you're right  I don't usually condemn people for making a mistake but he has been doing it for a while and  when I talk to him about it  he always justifies it  I'll try one more time and then I'll see from there  Plus  he's stealing from kids who don't know any better  so it makes it that much scummier yeah continue it's interesting for those of us who don't even try  so you have points for tryingI actually do    I have about  4 000 saved right now  but I also have other bills  i e  car  car insurance  gym  phone  ect   I would  love  to put away about  850 a month  average amount for a one bedroom in CA  but putting away the  300  600 a month is already testing me   10 000 is a great number though    watch a nice movie and eat a lot of  snacks The Sprouse twins turned out fine I feel like it would help to confront your brother about it   Maybe it's just me   But hearing the guilt come out of his mouth I feel would give me some kind of relief   Maybe even start some kind of healing process   Not that I'm assuming you'd want that   But for me I'd guess that would be square one I just want to add that it can take some time to find the perfect therapist  so don't be discouraged if the first one s  you see don't feel right   There is someone out there who will help you and I wish you luck in finding them  Truth of life  Academic advising is the among the weakest parts of the University experience  Many advisors are Professors who use the course catalog to scope out degree requirements and those requirements often change without everyone getting the message  You can send the advisor a note about it but that won't help you  At this point you should take the course and get on with your life  If the advisor is on Ratemyprofessor com you can note that information about him or her That doesn't mean you're dumb  If this is a long term relationship you're in  or someone that you were really in love with at some point  the idea of leaving might have freaked you out or made you feel guilty  which might have convinced you to stay   The fact that you are aware of his shitty behaviour  no longer want to tolerate  and are aware of the fact that you have enough independence to walk out on him whenever you wanted to kind of sounds like the opposite of "dumb"  OP   Good luck  don't let him get you down much longer  do whatever you need to for your own sake Not that far different from me  I even had the same issue   What got me turned around is realising that doing nothing isn't going to get me anywhere  Blaming others and hating them is fine but what are you getting out of it except an excuse   My dad was violent and my mum pretty much stole 3k from me then they kicked me out at 16  I was forced to find a shitty job on below minimum wage to pay for a flat I couldn't afford  I still have debts from it now which could have almost been covered by that 3k   Yes I'm still pissed off and angry but thinking of them laughing whilst I suffer with nothing pisses me off to the point where I'm willing to work my ass off for the dream of being able to go back with a wad of cash and say fuck you I recovered   Point is feeling bad doesn't do anything without the motivation to change it  Find your motivation No update I was at a work drinks once and offered to get a co worker a refill  She said that she was actually drinking selzter with lime  but she had that because everyone thought it was a vodka tonic and would stop badgering her to drink  the people that make a big deal about whether or not you're drinking are jerks  and they're also terribly insecure about their choices   here's the thought process  "if this guy isn't drinking  maybe he disapproves of drinking  and therefore his choice not to drink is an implied judgement of my choice to drink " If you also drink  they don't have to worry about whether or not they've done something "wrong" by having a drink   don't worry about them  I don't think I would want that  From what I can tell  he tried to make excuses to my dad about why he got arrested and charged for cp  He would probably just deny it if I confronted him on it  which would just upset me I would just tell him you're extremely busy and might be able to swing coffee or lunch to catch up  No need to go out of your way to accommodate him  If he's in town  you guys can meet up but it sounds like with the type of person he is  he is asking you to facilitate his whole stay again  I have a friend who does nothing to help her homeless situation and I have helped her many times with food  money  blankets  and rides to the ER  which I later found out where schemes to get pills   At some point you have to ask if you are okay making yourself uncomfortable to help someone that won't help themselves  Also  you're in a totally different realm nowadays  Just be careful the company you keep  It depends on what you like  really    If you're more reserved  there are a bunch of cute girls that read  Try some bookstores do it quick  they're becoming extinct  and comic book shops    If you're  really  desperate  I had  believe it or not  great success in Omegle  Took a long time but there are a few worthwhile people on there  not  looking to fap on cam    If you're anything like me  though  you're screwed  Can't really meet girls at the shooting range No one asks you to do much because they probably know the job is overwhelming at first  If they tell you that you'll learn in time  then they definitely don't expect you to know what you're doing   You say this is your first job  you have to understand that some jobs are like this  I know people who have studied for 4 years to get a degree in networking at university along with multiple certifications  and the first 3 MONTHS of their first jobs they all sit there like what the FU    What do I do  I don't fully understand   Whats interesting is that the manager  we're friends  completely expects this  they know that for at least 3 months to half a year you'll probably not "fully get it"   You've literally not even been in this job for 48 hours yet  if you understood all the terms going around and the job  I'd be questioning whether you were Einstein lol   I'd suggest you to relax  A LOT  they know you're new  this is your time to learn not to magically know everything  Second suggestion is to get a book  write down any terms you are unsure of and search the term when you have time  You'll probably end up picking up the lingo much faster  Third suggestion do more relaxing  p lol   If you find yourself bored with not enough tasks  might be worth asking someone if they needed any help with something that you might be able to easily handle  nothing too difficult   They'll hopefully think you're being super nice and productive  and gives you more of a chance to be more exposed to the work Work on being more assertive and don't put up with people treating you in any way you do not like   Holy shit  I didn't expect to get such an elaborate peptalk  Thank you so much for writing that all down     You're right  just asking him would be the least awkward thing to do  especially from his perspective   I get sweaty palms when I'm only thinking about it  but sure  I'll grow some balls and do it  At least I've got a few days left before school starts to mentally prepare That's sick       Everyone knows you do it with a watermelon   This woman has put you in her orbit friend zone   She keeps you around just for her ego   Nothing good will ever come out of this   Get out before things get any worse   like getting a wedding invitation from her Heard of Roku  excellent option Dude most of us can't even get into a really bad relationshipDo what you think is best for you  Discuss it with your girlfriend  you can still try long distance  Nah  more like the "fat is evil" of 20 some years ago  Sugar for the occasional treat isn't the problem  It's sugar being in everything  Processed foods are the evil  I feel so much better after moving to a cleaner diet with very limited processed foods  Fruits  vegetables and protein I guess I am rent an apartment for the week  since I have already told him that he can stay   I will have to dress down a bit  since I am a bit of a girl when it comes to clothes   I bought the same weater in every color last week   I blame Ru for that idea  lol   Weirdly  he emailed me just about an hour ago and the whole message was about money  He said he heard that I am doing pretty well and can't wait to see how I am living it up in London  I am afraid he is going to be sorely disappointed  Thank you for your advice  I often struggle with pulling back and letting someone sink their ship  I know what it I just don't  know how to defeat myself  meds do notjing for me except  piss me off I'm  on them   dbt is great I hear but i don't got that kinda money and unfortunately  that's  what it takes  I've  been analyzing for over a year and honestly ive  fou b d a lot wrong I'd  like to change but the body just isn't there with me  it's  quite tiring  Yeah  Fuck this post  Not reading this shit Same here  Except it's just my mom  She was born Catholic  and she's not even a very good Catholic   The thing about religion that always bugs me is that it's always the ones who fear God that end up being harder to deal with than the ones who love God  Like  you can  tell  when someone is scared of God  when the thought of hell that might not even exist manages to overshadow the value of true happiness  You can tell because they try to scare you too First of all  gg OP    I don't think it'd be worth it for you to let that friend come over to your house  If you really want to be his friend again you should meet him in a restaurant or something far away from your house   600 is on the low end for Nevada  If you go near Vegas or Reno  it will be much higher   They charge a premium because the prostitutes know they are the only place you can go to and do it legally in the United States  Also for normal people in their mid 20s  chances are they have spent much more than  600 going out on dates  buying gifts  doing activities with their girlfriend wife   So for some of us FA's with decent jobs  we have money were we can blow  600 on a prostitute and barely feel it financially because we don't spend it on girls or going out with friends  So what I am basically saying is who gives a fuck how much it was as long as they aren't hurting them selves financially and they enjoy it This is an incredible story    Like the other commenters  I think pursuing a relationship with John isn't really a higher level  long term interest of yours  Like the others said  he sounds pretty toxic  I think either way you're going to lose him as a friend    With Mary  it's a bit of a catch 22  If you don't admit your feelings  you're going to be left with her as a friend or lose her altogether  If you do admit your feelings  and she rejects you  you're going to be left with her as a friend or lose her altogether   So  to me  it seems like you  should  ask her out anyway because the possibility of her saying yes is the best possible outcome of this situation  If she says no  you're right back to where you started   Best of luck Thank you for that  I'm still trying to discover what my talents and skills are  I feel like a blank human canvas that has nothing special or meaningful on it   I make everyone laugh and I've been told I should do standup but I don't feel the confidence within myself  to go through with it    I don't know    I don't want his friendship  I want him gone and I wish I had never met him  He was so sweet kind and generous to others  I was always put in the back    I'm moving to Austin sometime this year when I graduate  I need change    Shortly after I felt better  I smoked some pot and watched family guy then ate some animal crackers  I see my therapist in a couple days   I was close to calling into work today and letting my manager know I was being admitted into a hospital  He knows about my depression bulimia etc    But I'm here  At work  Oh who cares  If you enjoyed it  congrats  If not  well  don't do it There's a simple fix to this which will also make you look better to your superiors   Tell them you feel like you would learn the role better if you partnered with someone more experienced for a few days to learn the ropes  They won't mind because it allows them to pick a decent staff member from you to learn from and it shows you are genuinely interested in the job    This has helped me learn many jobs I had no fucking clue how to do  In my area  you don't say no because jobs are hard to come by  you blag your way through it and hope you do alright   I've been a chef  office staff  switchboard  retail manager  mechanic  plumber  web designer among others and this has helped almost every time More ignored than anything I guess  In pretty much all of the friendships I've had  it seems that I've valued the friendship more than they did  What its the use of commenting with positivity to a thread that already sees you as black and white   At least to show that you learned  which in turn shows others that you are temporarily frustrated and can accept your mistake and not just permanently ignorant  or "black and white"  as you put it  Or just trolling for attention  That's how conversations are  Many of them are built on the expectation of opinions being exchanged and acknowledged    Your positive thread has seemingly got deleted by you or a bot  so I can't say anything about that    I'm merely stating that the karma system is censoring my opinion  The karma system isn't censoring your opinion  This is just more blame shifting  Your presentation of your opinion and inability to listen to opinions of others is what's censoring you   Look at these 2 examples here   "Sony robbed me of  17 by lying to me  but I actually just didn't take the time to read" vs "Sony developer needs to make descriptions clearer  so people can be aware of what they are buying and not make the same mistake I did"  These 2 examples  at least in my opinion  represent the same problem you had  But 1 immediately sets you up as an individual that is wrong and refuses to admit it  causing others to be more abrasive with you  while the other shows that you acknowledge the mistake you made and partially blames it on poor description that could be better  It doesn't take the blame from you  but it also doesn't put it all on Sony  like the first example    Presenting your opinion in a civil way and responding to others with an open mind instead of turtling up and defending yourself  even when you are wrong is the key difference here that could've made everyone's day better  You'd see that the community is actually friendly and helpful when people they are talking to are reasonable and not just looking to complain for attention approval of their point of view and the community would have 1 less blame shifting post to be dicks about  I'm sorry if this comes off as abrasive  but this is the best way I can put it  by starting off the conversation with being a dick that refuses to actually have a conversation and wants to be in an echo chamber instead  you will get a very unpleasant experience  while starting the same conversation in a more reasonable way and accepting your mistakes would give you better reception and experience You should really pay attention in class  You can't speak English i guess this is what i can't swallow   i wish certain people to be permanent Choose your battles  You're going to deal with plenty of insensitivity and lack of respect in a lifetime  Pick your spots for when to confront someone  assert yourself  or react in some fashion  The instance you described did not seem to be a spot where loosing your temper was worthwhile  I understand that getting no empathy from someone close to you is painful  but it's very rare to get a parent to change  I think this is one you should have let slide  Take your breakfast to go  This is definitely a great quote  Keeps things in perspective  I'm pretty sure it's illegal for them not to give you a day off or let you call in sick to go to a doctor Oooohhh that might have been what I heard then Well  I really did value his friendship  but after getting burned  I do find it hard to trust his motives now   It did occur to me that he might have noticed the upturn in my family's fortunes   I give my parents about 60k a year  and he thinks it's me   I miss his friendship  but it's been a while  so I am not sure what I expect from it  It really bothers me tho  He is actually the only person from my childhood that I am not still close with   None of the others know abouthp the money  but I would have no qualms about telling them or letting them into my home  I love you  Seriously  this is really I don't want to say inspiring because it sounds like I'm being sarcastic or something but like inspiring  I'm 28 and in a very similar spot and the pressure is just insurmountable  I don't have any friends currently  but when I was working and did have friends literally EVERY one was married with kids or was having weddings  of which I was not invited of course  and I have no idea how to meet people but just still feel this looming pressure like "it's all over at 30 you've got to find someone before 30"  After it was first "25" and then "26" then "27" and then so far this year I just jumped to 30 and took absolutely no steps to improve the situation at all   I signed on Tinder but never used it as I thought it was really just a "hookup" app and I don't want to get into that situation because I'm assuming it would be similar to throwing your rookie undrafted QB into the middle of the playoff game   Your post gives me some hope and I'm definitely going to retry Tinder again in hopes of replicating your success if even in some tiny way   Think of how Hollywood films are compared to real life   Thats the difference between porn and sex  Since Indiana is a right to work state  they can fire me for it  I've done my research on that  Try Dragon Age Inquisition  I love Oblivion too and Dragon Age was really really good That is the only way I have seen work  if you cant do that prepare to do a bunch of things that wull mitigate but never erase the pain    Sorry to hear that man  Wish I could give some encouraging advice  but judging from your post history  I have a feeling you've heard it all before  Really hope things turn around for you at some point I'd move to a different state  That's the most retarded law ever  Check out  r legaladvicethanks man great answerYou're right  I'm just scared they'll fire me after the first three months that are the trial period  I was desperate to get a job in the first place and now I'm terrified I'm going to lose it    but almost 20 isn't exactly a grown man  I think it actually is I'm moving to Nevada in three years luckily  but I don't want to wait that long to get teeth removed lolNo  I just go to a really competitive public high school  average SAT score is around 2100 Well that still leaves 49   that's 1 out of 2 women  That's not TERRIBLY bad Unsolicited advice happens to everyone  unfortunately I feel like they don't listen to me though Thanks for the tip   Of course this is all hypothetical and I may have a salary that meet expectations   Still a good tip I think she'd tell her friends that I ignored her and they'd stop hanging out with me  That's not what I wantIt's all down to what you can afford   If you are comfortable enough to wait out a new job then go for it but most employers  at least in the UK  hate any kinds of work history gaps   From a personal stand point I'd say do your job the best you can for now and try your best to get something lined up ASAP  It's easier to find work while your in work  Lol ok well considering he's the only person I've slept with  pretty fucking positive it's his  I'm not "trapping" him you inconsiderate twat  That's why I'm having a hard time telling him  So take that shit somewhere else because you're a prick  mate  I definitely don't need that  and sure as fuck won't put up with it  PeaceWell  if he is not attracted to men  that would ruin quite a few things if you guys were intimate  You should just stay friends Hey man  Copper Blue is an amazing album   Seems like the perfect thing to say  though if I hang out with her and her friends again and try to get with the friends  they'll think I'm a piece of shitYeah  I have heard it all before    Thing is you cannot fix ugly   and this is superficial af    Agreed    I would hate to ruin what we have alreadyUgly  Undoubtedly Everything you are feeling I can 10 10 validate as post concussion syndrome  My boyfriend had multiple concussions throughout a wrestling career    then a couple of years ago someone hit his car  head on  He was not wearing a seatbelt  He sustained a massive concussion and because of his previous concussion history it was labeled as traumatic brain injury   He went through severe depression  anger  memory loss  vision   hearing losses for the better part of year 1  Year two was milder symptoms but at times he mentioned suicidal thoughts  which he would have never considered prior   He couldn't stand to be around people and was basically a recluse   This is year 3  He is now a whole different person than he was immediately post concussion  His anger has subsided  vision is better  albeit no flashy lights and he cant be on anything 'spinny'   he is motivated and has just obtained a new career for which he is remembering all of these small details I never thought would be possible   It is a dreadfully long road  Please don't be so hard on yourself  You have a valid medical condition  School will always be there waiting for your return  You have to allow yourself time  This isn't your fault   Nah  he's just going to eat it  I mean  he is a frog after all Yup  Dry eye syndrome and fibromyalgia  a winning combination which makes it so physical pain is there 24 7  just like its emotional variant  Plus  my energy levels have always been painfully low    Don't see much of a point to anything  really That poor bunny    jesus   Fuck John  get rid of him in your life   Ask Mary  you cant live life in what ifs  Just do it To add on to what mitsukurina said  if you've done reflecting but still feel bad  or you are concerned about who reacted to whatever  remember that relationships need communication  Tall to your husband  tell him how you feel  Don't rush the conversation  If you need to think of an answer  take your time with it  breathe  and say what you need to say  Same goes for what your husband should do  whether he disliked it or was impartial or whatever    Just talk about it  and let time tick  Then the next day  whatever either if you said  talk about it again  Keep doing this  and don't let it turn into an argument  Don't bottle it up  and if you need to or if it comes to it  talk to your friend as well  Maybe that's what you need  Otherwise your friendship could turn toxic or resentful  What do you mean yup  why do people feel that urge to give advice when you don't ask  even worse is that they are giving advice about things they have actually no idea aboutI'm so incredibly sorry    but if that was like your relationship was like  he probably knew the extent of which you loved him  even if you never told him  People tend to feel that sort of thing   you mentioned that you still weren't being upfront about your emotions  I meant that I'm not really allowing myself to go to crazy about her  If I were to release all the emotions that I've been holding back for all these years  only to be turned down  it would probably mess me up big time     Does your tinder profile reflect your shyness  We're you upfront with her about your lack of experience confidence   No  I'm trying to act "normal" as much as I can  Not sure if it would scare girls away or not  but I don't really see the point of revealing that at this point  Some day  for sure  but when that day comes I don't know yet Thats what i want to think but I don't want to rely on it  They're changing shit up now and I'm in the guinea pig year  we have like numbers from 1   9 instead grades from F   A   Idk I've kinda given up on school at this point  I used to be pretty clever but now I feel as one of the dumbest  Grades are slipping away a little and it sucks  It's just a place where I talk to my friends at this point  This might not be the best advice  but you could express to her your interest in her friend and ask her to be your wing woman  It resets the boundary of your friendship with her and let's her know your intentions with her friend and if the friendship is important to her she might just help you  She's likely to be a little upset about it if she's crushing on you  but it's honest and straightforward and hopefully she'll realize pursuing you is futile  You just have to use good judgement and a lot of tact  Good luck That still seems outlandish to me considering your long future ahead  Well it was somewhat alarming to me hearing how you're just spending and not working  Financial advisors are usually gigantic wastes of money  Dedicate your time to learning how to manage your own money if you're not doing anything all day  You won't regret it  As for your friend  if he claims he will pay his own way and wants to rekindle a friendship then tell his ass to get a hotel instead of coming to your house  Or go to him  Take an uber instead of your car  It's not too difficult to figure out Seen this sort of thing a few times on Facebook as well  I wish people would instead word it as "I'd like to be wanted by someone that I also want"  that would be more accurate  On that note  people seem to want perfection from a partner  Great looks  great job  has all of their shit together  etc  But nine times out of ten  I bet they can't offer similar levels of perfection in return  What are you doing that deserves respect   Are you fully financially independent  Can you entertain a crowd  Or create a work of art No thank you brotha  you seem like you're a good man  because a damn good man makes himself better She's the one being really pushy  You're not required to talk to her  Your dad needs to understand work relationships are just that  Your dad is not a bank  he should never provide loans and encourage staff to work more to earn more   Sometimes if you can see someone is trying hard and they are worn out a one off payment isn't the worst but it's got to be a bonus to thank them for the work and nothing more   Sales staff unfortunately are the most manipulative people  I know because I used to be one  the entire role revolves around manipulation of others desires to buy your product   Unless your dad can be strict about these things he needs to have someone else dealing with it    It sounds like your dad is an amazing person though  congratulations and I hope he does well   I wish he could just see that the one thing he's always said he didn't want to do   that he's doing it right now   This is so true   I'm so sorry   I know it's hard  but this is his inability to be a grown up and isn't about you at all   Even if he's convinced himself he's being altruistic  he's not   He's being self absorbed  selfish and very condescending   He seems to think you can't make your own decisions   I know how much it hurts  but he isn't good for you until he grows the fuck up   I'm not one to advocate no contact  but sometimes you have to make the choices they won't to protect yourself   Block him every where so you only have to weather this one more time   You will never get an explanation   He isn't capable   That's his failure at humanning  not yours   I am so sorry   Hugs to you I hear ya  I struggle with that too  Here I am struggling to make a living and this guy can commit a crime and live a better life than I  To hell with this world "I don't want to ruin his future  I want him to do what he wants to do and if he wants to be single  I want that for him too "     Abortion or Adoption  it is not right for you to keep his kid without his permission  but it also wrong for you to expect anything or for him to have any "obligations" to you for your mistake     Hit "Reset" for both of you  If abortion is out of the question  find an Adoption service quick   Earlier the better for the KIDDO   Sorry  Not Sorry  Just trying to be an ultimately HONEST human male     So  applying this to your post  You speak Russian to some degree  You are an artist to some degree  You have morals that are important to you and motivate you toward a career  I'm assuming you aren't homeless and unemployed  so you seem capable of supporting yourself  You recognize that you should be more physically fit  which makes me think you used to be more so    You sound like a pretty well rounded person who just needs to find a little motivation  And maybe you need some sort of catalyst to shake up your life a bit  Maybe you should start looking for that job that fits your morals  regardless of where it is located  A move to a new place and a new job could be the kick in the ass you need to break out of this rut    Yeah I have a basic understanding of written Russian   I'm learning it because  well  I need to complete an advanced proficiency course in a foreign language to get the degree I want    I would have picked Dutch if my university offered it but I guess not enough people speak it   If I were some sort of super learner  I would idealy want to know every major language    but two is probably all I'll ever get to   Dutch interests me because it's my heritage  but Russian interests me because    well  that's a bit more complicated   Its just a really awesome language  haha   It's fun    And I am not homeless    yet   I am a student  been looking for a part time job for a long time now      I think you're right about a change in my life   I just came to the realization a few days ago that I would like to transfer universities  but sadly most deadlines for fall attendance have passed up already   Plus moving again    god   This school offers everything I need in regards to education  but that's about it   Not really any interesting and active clubs   The football and party culture is too prevalent here for my liking   Hindsight is 20 20   When I transferred to this school I was just excited to start my education again  but now I see that it really doesn't fit me at all  and I'm not happy here   On the otherhand  I really only have a year or two left to complete my degree  and I'm thinking I should just stay here and finish  and then hopefully get into a good graduate school that I actually like   Idk   I can truly do whatever I want  though  my parents aren't paying a single cent of my tuition so they can't tell me that that one out of state school is too much  I'll just have to decide if that extra debt is worth it   Probably not   I want to stay close to them though  because they are getting really old now and taking care of them will most likely be my responsibility     why did they wait so long to have kids    Sorry for the rant   You're right   I need motivation    somehow   Thanks  You haven't heard anyone say darlin before  Haven't you heard of an accent before  After that first response I think OP shouldn't have bothered with a follow up message  That would be the cue to delete that conversation  that person's number  mope silently over them for a bit and then hope for better with someone else I see now  please allow me to reflect on this comment  Will see about that deleted thread It's not only that it could ruin everything  he is STRAIGHT   Dude  if you cannot forget those feelings  better just stop talking to him at all  You are going to suffer emotionally  It's like you are in the friendzone but you already know 100   that nothing is going to happen not UofT but rather Queen's university  i think they take it about as seriously though          My brother used to do this  He's also 3 years younger   He would take clothes and games etc all the damn time so I did the same thing to him back to piss him off knowing it was stuff he used a lot   If your parents won't deal with it  force your sister to call a truce  It won't stop fully but it will cut down  It is hell  You're missing the point     Eating animal fats isn't vegan  Diets aren't one size fits all  but a vegan diet isn't what you described  It's a diet low in meat  with animal fats and plants veg  Respect what he says and look for intimacy elsewhere  thanks a ton man  basically i dont have many if any options so i plan to appeal the sanction  in hopes the senate board decides to suspend me instead of expelling me entirely   if that doesnt work ill try to apply to other schools  but i dont think that will work from what ive been told by others   and if that in turn doesnt work im planning on joining the marines for three years minimum and applying as an adult to some US school in the future  3 4 years   in hopes that they dont check with the canadian universities about my academic history  my lifes pretty much over though  which fucking sucks and i dont think my family will ever accept me againThree months is not that much and if she really loves you she will be ok with it  Do you happen to watch a lot of porn  I've heard that fapping a lot can cause you to be like  desensitized and make it hard to get it up with a real girl  Finger each others' butts  get a Roku and Chromecast and then get subscriptions to Amazon and Netflix  Also  do your parents have a cable account  If so  maybe they will let you share their login so that you can watch shows on the internet   I work customer service and it feels fake  I'm excellent at looking happy and putting on a fake smile and nobody suspects that I'm actually dead inside This   As much as I want to advise you to moonwalk into his office and say 'fuck this shit I'm out' it never works out well in the end   Resignation letter but it's your choice if you want to mention the reason for moving on  If you want to play hardball and possibly get a raise  then tell them the truth  Happy to help  I know it's futile to even say this  but try not to overthink it  The execution doesn't really matter  He's either open to it or not right now  If you frame it one way versus another  it's not going to really change his answer  Therefore just throw it out quick and casual They wait till there older now a days  I get enough girls into me but fuck all on tinder  It's not the only way  real life works better for most people  Just be yourself  a confident almost egotistical version of yourself  Chicks love that   After it was first "25" and then "26" then "27" and then so far this year I just jumped to 30 and took absolutely no steps to improve the situation at all   Been there  Every damn birthday  same delusional "This year I'm going to meet someone" without actually doing anything about it     I thought it was really just a "hookup" app and I don't want to get into that situation  Just mention in your profile that you're looking for something serious and you should be fine  I think that the closer to 30 people come  seeing their friends get married and have kids  they tend to take it all a bit more seriously   Sorry I got my wisdom teeth  all 4 at age 20  pulled this morning and I'm finally coherent enough to reply to this  I'm so sorry about your ex and that she did you wrong when you really needed her as well  We can both get through these shitty times and I'm sure we will be much stronger once we do  It's the getting there part that really  really sucks    Don't be afraid to pm me anytime you would like to talk  Make sure you have cable internet so you can stream content but as far as the TV itself there ware pletnty of alternatives online  Netflix  Hulu plus etc   You can make a million plans  but life can truly get in the way     I know that lesson all too well for someone my age  lol          I'd say you're going to reach an apex within each decade   That's depressing    I probably reached my apex in 2012 or 13   Hopefully the 20's will be betterDawgs and Pussies I'm older  have a health   pain problem  It really is the ultimate double whammy to inceldom  First no GF  then nowdays it's hard to think of a life where even having a GF would be possible    A lot of FAs  who tend to be young and have some hope  rightfully  just can't relate  so even when I chat with them it ends up dying out   I'm forever alone among FAs too    In fact  a lot of times it even makes me more depressed  knowing that I'd kill to be in the shoes of a regular FA here  young and healthy    Once you hit this class of problems  I feel like it's the last stop    you basically can't relate to anyone and everything is pointless  even if I find a GF  still will have my other problems    and having these problems would rightfully push away any GF I manage to get anyway       Anyway  if any older or health problem FAs incels want to chat  I set up a discord server  I'm online practically all the time  except when I'm playing a video game  potato PC  it uses up ram    https   discord gg tswMDSh  Thank you very much  I will check it out  I have also started looking at digital options  but didn't know if it was a good place to start Yo what the fuck   What in the fuck You're a super awesome person for supporting him through such a horrible experience   How would you talk to someone you just met in real life  Just ask generic shit till the conversation picks up  how are you  Doing anything interesting  That sort of thing   then send a completely unwarranted picture of your dick lol   In all seriousness don't do the last one  someone did that to my girlfriend a while ago and we still laugh about it now  Noooooo we told you to stop talking to her last week yuh dingus  She is being super degrading to you    Maybe you could send your mom something in the mail anonymously   It might look like a family friend sent it or something  Depending on PC or console  check out the following  Guild Wars 2 PC   H1Z1 PC   Skyrim PC Console   Fallout New Vegas  or 4 PC Console   there's a few more I can't think of at the moment    It all depends on what aspect you like  the adventure fantasy rpg aspect or the open world survival aspect or the mixture of both  Skyrim Special Edition on console is amazing and with mods you can add endless amounts of gameplay to an already endless game    Good luck in your search for a new game So what's her excuse  Or was she inexperienced as well What is the best way to find a therapist that specializes in this sort of thing thank you very much  i forgot bdsm is a thing  LMAO  but yeah  this makes a lot of sense  thank you for helping me out  I was in a slightly different situation than you are  only texting and after the upcoming story also skype  but in the end we never met b c we live about 5 hours apart and I might have overseen some pretty obvious signs from her side  But that was around 2 month after what I'm about to tell you  so I don't consider them connected   Anyways  the topic came up at one point from her side and when I told her the truth  without any "dodging"  but openly saying that this is a difficult topic for me and explaining why   she was super open minded about it  And that was so awesome  It felt like that no no topic that I was actually scared to talk about vanished in seconds  Like a giant relieve  it felt really good   I just want to give you the flipside of the coin and another perspective as you said you can't see anything positive coming from doing that Congratulations  You now know how to do it  And that knowledge stays for the rest of your life Thank you very much  I think point three is a good but I also think point 4 about the CBT is also close  I think he is just going into stage 2 of the five stages of recovery  for a couple of months   And I will definitely take your last point into account   Thanks again  this is really helpful What type of keyboard  Mechanical or membrane   If it's mechanical the keys usually lift off so you can clean below it easier  If it's membrane then unscrew the back and it will split into 3 pieces  keys  rubber membrane and circuit board with back plate   Make sure keyboard is unplugged and wipe it down  Most keyboards are fairly water proof  Nothing you can really do besides try to find someone to replace her  Moving on in this case means doing what it takes to get them off your mind  I'm not talking about a rebound to distract you from her for a couple days  but just someone else worthy of chasing  Look around at prospects you may have and start to wonder what it would be like to date them instead  Maybe someone you have a better chance with   Keep your mind off them  do your best not to daydream about them  accept that right now it's not an option and make better use of your time  Coding  existing engines and generally how games are made   Most engines are just rehashes of existing engines tweaked to fit the purpose better  thank you for your help  heheh  im seeking a therapist out currently  hopefully it helps  also i should learn to rather embrace it than push the feeling away  another comment said i should try to get into bdsm  which might help  so fingers crossed  Read more about psychosis or schizophrenia   Still   if that's the case   you will need soon  medical help   In the mean time   talk to your wife about it  She will get more insight into your mental health and you both will feel better to get things said   Also   together you can plan how and what to do  If she skips you there is around a 90  chance she likes you  How do you deal with sexual frustration besides casual sex  Put yourself out there and find someone that makes you feel the way you did with your ex An Open Secret   Man that was an eye opener  I had the same experience  plus it sent me down a massive black hole regarding the subject  You're not obligated to return every affection someone has for you  So being honest is the best you can do     If they decide to be assholes despite you doing the right thing  then that's not your fault  Maybe they'll grow up some day and see that you were just being responsible  Until then  just let them think what they wanna think  But don't bow to double standards If it was that easy bro millions would have done it  I'm a web designer myself and if someone has a brilliant idea they aren't going to share it with a redditor  When I said "purposely ugly pictures" I am mostly referring to pictures in which you make weird faces  I appreciate it but tried that too  hell as said mate alone on NYE and Xmas and last year asked about 20 ppl to see SW with me   never happened lol   I know it sucks guys to see the Debbie Downer posts and the like  and I loathe using the new buzzword of triggered but it fits    People like me get kinda hurt and angry when we see these   not that we want to crap on anyone's joy  just that it's like watching everyone else eat and you are starving for even an irl friend    At 39  it kinda sucks to know you will never have a partner  never be married or have kids or that even if you feel love it will be that bitter  unrequited kind    Don't believe in the damn friendzone  Red Capsule BS   don't think women are objects and not just looking for sex  although I am not saying I hate the idea or anything    Not that this entitles me to jack shit  but it is depressing to see guys who do buy that crap get what you cannot   its kinda shitty to see    In short  although some of these 'whiney' posts are probably grating  it is born of lack of a basic human need  It sucks to be alone  not heard a human voice outside work or daily bs or even been around anyone since mid October   so ppl get depressed reading about this at times and pop   I guess I'm apologizing for all of them  although some as said and some groups sprung from this faction of society are toxic as hell    But it just makes you so angry  like you are not even Human or even alive or part of a species   sucks   EDIT  And before anyone says then why come here  Because hope is a hell of a thing to lose and it's not like anyone wanted to give up   You might want to ask  r nostupidquestions or  r eli5 for better answers    I can't tell you the factual truth or anything  I can just say I think it stems from negative things like lack of attention  lack of accomplishments in life  abuse  depression  or just a low feeling of value to other people  If your formative years are spent wondering why people don't find value in you  then the later years are spent wondering why the people you have now see any value in you at all    Low self worth also coincides with self hatred and people's perception of what others are worth  Say you meet a funny  good looking guy girl that really digs you  Some of low self esteem would feel unworthy of this valuable person to the point that they are scared of them discovering how little they are worth  in their minds   It's something that takes a lot of time and reassurance to get through  therapy helps to untangle the thought process people are stuck with assuming all this    TL DR   Low self esteem means low self worth  Something happened in people's lives where they felt they were worth less than others and it sticks with them  Sugar marketers hate him  Find out why   I suggest watching their interview with Chelsea Handler on her talk show on Netflix  They seem like really wonderful down to earth kids  and they talk about their fame   Louis and Dustin were friends on Broadway before the show  They seem pretty chill with the fame  Eleven is loving it  She is actually British  So fun to hear her talk     what 'normies' do you speak with  Sex is not overrated  unless it's BAD sex   I think this story is great  Well done for doing what you want and having a great time doing it No  I have one  We met online like 10 11 years ago  never met him in person  but he's a very good friend  Other than that  I let all of my friends go after high school and I focus on college now instead of making friends I've definitely considered the community college route   I just assumed that since I had racked up a decent amount of credits with this university that it would make the most sense to finish the last few semesters there   Perhaps I'm wrong   With the living situation I have lined up I'd be able to attend school full time and work part time to pay what bills I'd still have  considering my student loans would be deferred while fully enrolled    One concern I have as of today is the quality of my application  filling it out in high school is much different than filling it out a decade later   What are some things I can add to I guess give it an edge   Is that even necessary   I don't remember my SAT ACT scores  do those even matter now  I hope I don't sound like a complete idiot   just out of the loop   Another major concern I have is what influence my current outstanding bills with the university may have on my application process   It's not a huge sum  as financial aid covered most expenses  but I still owe the school around  7 000   Also  the last time I applied for any sort of financial aid I was still a dependent and  admittedly  my parents did all of that paperwork for me   Truth be told  the idea of building more student debt terrifies me but trying to obtain a job w o a degree can almost guarantee I'll never be able to pay them off in my lifetime   This probably sounds like a jumbled mess  I have issues processing stress which results in text vomit     Thank you for your kind advice Exactly  Right from the second or third grade  people have always respected me less  It sounds like I'm complaining  but guess what  Back then I didn't complain about it I just approached every situation with confidence and an open mind and it never did anything so I might as well complain because it doesn't matter anyway  If I ever went out of my way to do anything good  19 times out of 20 it was completely glossed over while my peers were showered with admiration  And if I stepped out of line in school for example  the teacher would come at me with an extremely exaggerated reaction punishment which my peers would never get and it was always completely unexpected for me because I never expected someone to come down on me that harsh yet they almost always did  often for the tiniest infraction  like letting people know you exist  My peers would reject me too  always letting me know that basically wherever I went there was an unwritten rule that I wasn't part of the group  like I wasn't allowed to be a full member of society  all because of my looks    This explains the behavior of many attractive men and some of the high status average looking men where they treat women like trash  say "Wazzup bitch" to a girl they've never seen before  catcall etc  It's because they know that no matter what they do  they're attractive and desirable so it really doesn't matterWell you can't force an easiness with people you're not comfortable with  You can't force it to happen just because you're lonely or bored or want some connection  It's what makes friendship so valuable  is that genuine friendship is so rare  There are plenty of fake friendships  fake marriages  from the outside they look happy and fulfilled    but it's an act  They cling to empty relationships because they're terrified of being in your current position  So I guess that's what it comes down to  do you want a little bit of gold  or a neverending supply of pyrite    And about being alone and lonely   we all experience this  and it's always an opportunity for growth   to lead on to stronger relationships with others  Once you accept it's a normal thing that everyone goes through  it's easier to enjoy solitude  and not settle for fair weather friends  Haha I get it now People will sometimes take advice or ignore it  All you can do is offer opinion  I mean that's the entire reason this sub is here right   I have seen many friends make stupid errors continuously and almost always I was correct in how things turned out  The best thing you can do if you value the friendship is let them fuck up and be there to pick up the pieces without rubbing it in   One thing I do have to point out though is your ages are similar and you are opposite sex  is there any chance she thinks you are jealous   Edit  ignore that last question  Missed the bit you mentioned you were married  She obviously doesn't care about you as much as you do her    Cut her out of your life  She's not a part of it anymore  She doesn't want to be  This isn't something you can fix    Time heals all wounds  truly  Good luck  Cut her out and don't look back  Sorry for the harsh words  Problem is when you can't think of a question where you'd be interested in the answer  that's what OP was saying   4K is a lot of money to have saved up believe it or not  You always see the articles that over 50 percent of Americans don't even have 1000 saved so you are already doing better than half of the us  Good on you  You'll need     tattoo or microchip for ID   vaccinated against rabies  vaccination must be at least 21 days old   must be accompanied by a person responsible for the animal and there needs to be a document that the import is not for the purpose of selling or trading the animal   travel should be direct from one country to Germany  if you stop in an "unlisted" country  not EU  you'll need another document that says the animal didn't have any contact with animals that have rabies    not more than 5 animals   source  https   www

find anything of a quarantine for those countries   But please check also with the german consulate Truth is  I will probably end up telling her if she asks  Guess I need to come up with a good way of telling it  Thanks for sharing I think you definitely should bring it up  You have a right to know what's gone on  But yeah  the man who's brought you up needs to know that hasn't gone unnoticed  I understand that this is a massive bombshell to you but just try to remember that he's been there for you all this time    Ken M  Thank you   It's not harsh at all  But the thing is   its been 6 months   I deleted her from everything   but i still think about her   And both female lol  it's all good  I think I need to just be ready to pick up the pieces  like you said  Very good advice Online  Nothing  Unfortunately  My online friend committed suicide  and I couldn't do anything  Just make them sure you are there for them  Bring them down to earth  all the people that care  everyone goes through it ext  Wish you all this best op I understand the frustration you are going through  I am still recovering from post concussion syndrome since 2012  there are days I am fine  and others are frustrating  I am making great gains  you will make it too Aw that has to be rough  I would sit him down and talk to him  Talk through it and then keep an ongoing dialogue as the different emotions come up  hugs  Some guy didn't pay his taxes on time because he was homeless  "WE WILL FIND YOU AND YOU WILL PAY"  Multi billion dollar corporations using loop holes to avoid paying any corporate tax  "    meh what can you do  Tax laws amiright "But I can't have such high standards  I've spent my free time on the internet for several years  and spoken to people at my school  and no one has seen like an obvious potential friend  I have problems relating to other people  and if I don't change  I feel I'll just continue living life alone this article is reprinted from a book and doesn't for even a single sentence specifically mention negative health affects of sugar  it's an extremely surface level critique of the whole US food system  absolutely terrible headline Its only weird if you make it  My advice is to call it an orgy and not a birthday party  that way it is impossible to rebound from being called weird  Good luck He's either playing you off to make you jealous or trying to piss you off    Either way as someone else put you are not with him and he's not with you  stop looking him up and contacting him then you have nothing to worry about   If you continue further you are just as bad as he is because you clearly want something to happen yourself  good or bad if it carries on  There's literally no reason for you two to be in touch at all  Definitely go to NYC  that's sort of a no brainer if you're coming to the US for the first time   San Francisco would be a classic that would be a nice complement to NYC  but might I also suggest Portland  Seattle  or Denver instead   Smaller cities with very distinctive personalities  and you can get some hiking or kayaking in as well   On the other hand  if you want more of the 'ethnic' experience then try LA  Miami  Atlanta or even Santa Fe I'm starting a lift while showering meetup group  Just have to get out there and volunteer or go to groups on meetup like mine bro  You will ooze confidence after being in my group  hmm maybe you can ask them something about work or school  maybe  never had that problemNicoilaNo matter what he says  you will say he did it wrong  We have been down this road before Because of the sheer amount of content being produced and talent that is available now  you have to be that much professional to survive    It used to be that you find a kid actor like Macualy Culkin or Lindsay Lohan and suddenly they are in every single role being written for kids  You had a handful of child actors that were A list    Thing with these kids is that while they are in a successful Netflix show  there are also half a dozen successful Netflix shows being produced each year    The idea of the prima dona is almost dying out  Movies used to be written for actors  And now you have even A list actors having to work to land movies or TV shows because writing and storytelling is now being appreciated as just as much of a brand as acting  There is more of a balance  Thank you for your kind words That's actually a pretty decent one  Might take it into account  thanks I always find the people who parrot the whole 'I love being single' stuff are people who have their needs fulfilled in other ways   in other words they get laid a lot  All well and good being happy at being single and 'not bothered about relationships' when they are banging chicks all the time  Must suck being so attractive or having good 'game'I haven't taken the time to read through all the comments  who are probably giving you some really good advice  but if you think it's worth anything and you don't want to break up with him I think one of the best places you can start is by either showing him this post or by sitting down and telling him something true to the sentiment of this post   Communication during hard times is so important for relationships  and even though that this will probably be one of the hardest conversations you'll ever have  it is imperative for the both of you   Like  you could've used this space to be relentlessly pissed about him and just completely tear into him but you didn't  You've delivered  what seems to be  a very patient and sympathetic response to an extremely stressful and emotional situation  Share how you really feel about this situation  it's clear that you want him to come out of this just as much as you do  If you're willing to continue being patient  then letting him know that you want to be there for him and help him out of this situation will probably motivate  something  to change   If it doesn't  then you're just going to have to know when to quit   Good luck  OP  You can make it through this  one way or another  by I have a Facebook bookmark with my  half sister's Facebook whom I befriended with a fake person account  Why In the words of Luke Cage 'it's never just a coffee'   Honestly whilst coffee may not seem bad to you I feel you need to reconnect with her more in a group setting first from what you put  It's probably better to have a few people meet up to do something because it's less pressure  If she says no then try again later  She will cave eventually  Accept it just for experience and so that you don't seem smug despite the fact that you plan on leaving   Some knowledge is better than none   Also  if things do turn south  you will always have a company you can possibly lean back on We don't know yet    We are welcome to suggestions Yeah it sounds pretty normal  When I have lived with an SO  in a few relationships   instead of texting every thing to the other one about stuff that happens  we save some for nice conversations for when we're at home having dinner etc  Every couple will find their own balance in these things  Then it comes back to gold vs pyrite  If you desperately want a circle of acquaintances  as you've already alluded to  you need to drop your standards  You need to make more compromises to be accept and fit in  Washington DC  Grand Canyon  There's also this other place  I don't know what it's called I don't remember  where you can be in 4 different states in the US by walking only a few feet  Colorado mountainous area and gaze at stars at night  Might not be the best place in the US to do this  but it sounds good to me if I'm guessing correctly   New York city  go to Yellowstone national park and see the geysers  not much else I can think of at the moment idk if this helped you or nah Thank you  Portland  Seattle and Denver   obviously this is a very vague question   but what are the distinctive personalities of these cities  Thank you so much for your reply and the words of encouragement  I'm trying to be a strong as I can for him  I love him more than anything and I know his life may be harder because of all of this  but I hope that I do my best to make a good life for him that lets him become a strong and loving man some dayNot true I might have to try that  Thing is  I'm already a negative person as it is Yeah these people are freaking literal  I just want to shove them a chill pill  Fruit is sugar  but wrapped in it's natural fibrous container   It still needs to be moderated but it's a far cry from the added sugar in soda  low fat  and other processed foods  When I'm on the track  be it for real or on the simulator  I feel like I'm in a whole different world  Too bad I can't stay there for long The it do is yes than they Have you thought about selling on Ebay or the Internet for a living  You can do most of it at home  Yes  you'll have to interact with people at the Post Office and where you source your items  i e  garage sales  estate sales  thrift stores  etc  but you could look at it another way  You are not really dealing with these people  you are using them to further your business and make money Hey I know that this is kind of hijacking but your comment helped me get a good mindset of my own ex   I've been trying to put it into words but you nailed it    Thank you  I might be able to move on a bit forward because of you   And   OP    She's worth less than dogpoo on the sole of your flipflops on the beach a suddenly cold and windy summer day   Don't spend any time thinking of her when you've got so much living to be doing  She doesn't deserve you and you deserve someone or something better to fulfill your life  I went to college myself at age 35  let me tell you  you're in for a hell of an experience   The biggest thing by far is to not let 19 year olds acting like 19 year olds get to you   Maybe that will be easier for you having come from the military   But for me I had to really learn to relax and enjoy the antics and drama  occasionally being a parental figure or voice of reason to some of the kids   In the end I really liked it and made some lasting friendships with people more than a decade younger than me  but it took time and work   As far as the logistics  call them Professor until they tell you otherwise  or if you have a very military look and bearing then Sir Maam would be fine   Take advantage of every opportunity for office hours if you need it  you'll find people more than happy to help someone older  especially in my case  1st in family to go to college    Accept the social invitations but act your age   Etc   Good luck and enjoy If it satisfies what you look for in a job then go for it  Should not be scared of trying Go to Walmart and get a Straight Talk prepaid phone if you're staying in the states you should be fine  it uses the Verizon network Sounds like your boyfriend has had a lucky escape Some fruits and vegetables have sugar  yes   Many don't   Off the top of my head  coconuts  cucumbers  cranberries  grapefruit  kiwi  lemon lime  olive  raspberry  avocados  strawberry  and tomatoes don't have much sugar    Regardless  in virtually all cases  sugars found in fruits are bound within fibrous pulp  slowing it's absorption  juicing on the other hand  negates this benefit    Also the sugars seem to have less negative health consequences compared to stuff like HFCS  1  Ignore him  He's doing all of this because he knows it hurts you  The best revenge is living well  especially without him    2  Block him from everywhere online and IRL  Even if it includes telling your friends you do not want to hear about his spiteful shenanigans  Take the high road  Trust me  life will get better without him    3  Go enjoy your life  Forget your ex  This is just creating more drama than you need or anyone here needs  It doesn't satisfy me  Alright well I have some questions for you 'fa grill'  Are you really FA  KHV    Are you looking for a bf   Have you tried online dating   How many guys have you turned down   How many guys did you like but not message first   Are your standards too high   Yeah  he is indeed an amezing person  when I was a boy I used to whine about him being so strict  but now I see his intentions   I can't see him being strict about it  and the chances of him having another person to deal with it are preeetty slim  non existant I would say  he is the type of person who likes to take the matters into his own hands  even more when we're talking about the business which he built from scratch   I just don't get how can I convince him of that  he is too much stubborn to listen to anyone  he hardly listens my mother  who spends almost 100  of the time with and knows everything that's happening here and how it would affect them  I can't help but to think that he wouldn't listen to me  who am living my own life away from them  knowing him as I know  he would just say "Don't bother with it kiddo  I know what I'm doing  we need him  he is a good salesman and we're in times of trouble   "  and in the end I'm just plain afraid that my relation with my dad deteriorates  he's not the type of guy who likes hearing "You're wrong"  we all know that he likes much more of the Yes man type of person  and I'm not like that at all Hey there  I want to let you know that I've been in your exact position  They discovered I had really low white cell counts when I was 17 and the same thoughts ran through my mind  I was terrified of cancer or leukemia or anything else and I thought I was doomed  My dad also has an autoimmune disease so I also worried about having what he had  and all the complications that went with it    In reality  it's not so gloom and doom  They will do a bunch of different tests to determine why your counts are low  I actually ended up not having any sort of cancer at all  I'm a rare case where I basically have really low counts naturally  They still haven't determined exactly why but we found a good treatment for me to stay out of trouble and I just keep an eye out for infections    I'm 26 now and it's just part of my life now  I know it's super scary  and you have a right to be  The unknown is always terrifying  But try not to worry yourself into an even worse position because there are some awesome doctors out there who will help you get to the bottom of this and support you through it  If you want to hear more about anything I've experienced as I've gone through a ton of testing over the years  feel free to PM me   Sending internet hugs  and remember you aren't alone in this Thank you for your response and support it means a lot and I'll keep those words in mind to recall when bad feelings come   Learning a new skill would do me some good  Every time I hear the V word alarm bells ring that I'm about to get a moral lecture or be killed a mass murderer  Accept the new role at your company  because you never know when the changeover is actually going to take place  My guess would be that your boss might suspect you are looking to leave and is trying to do something to keep you  Perhaps  but you can certainly not care about certain things without being depressed  and you may simply not have the social skills to move   start   continue a conversation to   about a topic that does actually interest you  so it doesn't seem all that unlikely to find someone who isn't depressed but who's still just really bored by most   all conversations they have while still craving conversation   I myself am perhaps  probably  depressed  but there are still plenty of things I enjoy  But listening to the answer of just about any question I can think to ask  or answering just about any question I'm asked  and yeah  yeah  inspiration and all that  just seems more like a chore than anything else  I can't help but feel like I don't even get the slightest hint of enjoyment from it  and being depressed will maybe change the   amount   of enjoyment  but not   whether   you enjoy something  I just googled it  There is a place not too far from where I live  interestingly  I will look into this  Thank you for bringing it to my attention Fuck  Did I write this Well  you have to start SOMEWHERE  Either get rid of the gaming machine entirely or give yourself a strict limit  No more than X hours per day of gaming  After a while try to lower it even further    Start to figure out some other things you might be interested  To start just list out things you have at least a passing interest in  books  photography  sports  music  art  cars  politics  WHATEVER  Don't worry yet about what to do with them  just come up with a list of things you think might be interesting  and post them here  People here can help with suggestions for what to do with those things   If you do go out  only drink in moderation  One or two drinks is enough for many people to start lowering inhibitions  He sexually assaulted you  Do not hang out with him again  Tell him you aren't going to hang out with him because he sexually assaulted you  And of course you're not a slut  There's nothing wrong with having whatever kind of sex you want to have when you want to have it  In this case  you were forced  Thanks You mean like Skyrim didn't feel like Oblivion   No I respectfully disagree with you   I also did not like the voiced character  settlement system  and lack of a karma system   But  it was a good fallout game   That's what I've been trying  I'm fine with making these people my friends  I just have difficulty doing it Well  if it makes any difference  the desire for change is a pretty good place to start  When you're consistently demotivated  that can end up being a very hard thing to cultivate   The fact that you are experiencing this much sadness over entering this profession is a clear sign for change  Although the prospect is intimidating  it definitely isn't impossible   I'd recommend exploring your options  doing research into things that interest you  maybe even doing a little bit of soul searching in your spare time  Despite age  despite anything  it's never too late to work towards a better version of yourself and it never will be  Just because we run out of time eventually doesn't mean that we have to let ourselves be miserable in the time we have left because we feel we don't have enough of it   I'm assuming you have a degree  figure out how flexible it is  see what skills can be applied to jobs that are a little less soul sucking and see what you can find when the time feels right for you   Good luck with it all  I can't understand your situation  but it most likely sucks in so many ways  Don't give up  one day you'll be glad you didn't I always tell myself that if I don't enjoy a certain thing about my job profession  I quit  A job is something you do for months or years  If you don't enjoy your profession  the consequences will affect you as a person  I would think again about my place in that company and what influences it would have on me  and wether it's best to stay there or let it go and move on  You can always try of course  it is an extra experience  if your contract allows to do so   I'm 17  Oh sweet summer childRecently I've actually started playing games less  It's not like I can't stop doing it   I just don't have anywhere to begin  I wish I could straight away start going out with people   the thing is  I don't really have anyone to go out with    And yeah  I should've drunk less and that's what I'm going to do next time  I just didn't really know my limit because I hadn't been to parties like this before  It gave me a little bit of experience  I understand exactly how you feel  I'm feeling it too  You hurt so bad you don't know what to do min by min  You might want to re think your logic   If I can find you one heroin addict who's lived to be 95  does that mean you could will live to 95 if you become a heroin addict Vegas  Or would that be too much of a night life    I would highly recommend Seattle  San José    San Diego  Normal Well I mean    what is it Trucker well  good sir  it's every man's opinion to himself  I hope you had a blast playing those games   D  What did you most like about fallout 4 Many electricians get a van and go on their own  Money varies depending on location but you can make a pretty decent living off it  The best money comes from being contracted externally from construction companies to do first fixes etc on new buildings or renovation    Theres a saying among trades folk that 'no matter what happens with the country  there's always work in trade'   Starting off its better to work for a company and advertise yourself to book jobs on your days off  if you get decent money then quit the company  I'm from East Yorkshire so I don't know London wages much but check direct gov for a general idea   In terms of common injuries  pretty much every electrician gets electrocuted at least once  It's actually something they joke about after its happened  No matter how good you are it will happen once  Other than than  bad knees are common later if you don't use knee pads in your pants  you will often get dirty if you do first fixes too but other than that it's pretty straight forward   Source  Been a tradesman myself when I was younger When we first started dating  my fiance and I would text and talk nonstop   Eventually we knew each other well enough that we didn't have to reiterate our opinions and could even kinda reach each others' minds based on body language   As others have said  it's perfectly okay to have stretches of silence with your SO so long as neither of you are uncomfortable   In truth we both have started to enjoy those moments when we can just enjoy each others' presence without having to prattle away Now that is hard to believe  unless you mean they look like they're 95  then I would agree I've had depression and anxiety for almost my entire life  but I attributed much of these symptoms  before their sudden worsening within the past weeks   the delusions and occasional hallucination  to an escalation into psychotic depression     I no longer think that that's the case  and suspect schizophrenia  but when I mentioned this to my wife  she just said I wasn't schizophrenic  and that even if I was showing symptoms  they were likely self caused   Not sure why she would think that If you're unsure what you want to major in you should talk about your concerns with an academic advisor  That's what they doBad self confidence caused by past unpleasant people and situations   It could be something in that   Anyway   you should tell that to some trusted person  a very good friend that you know can stand you beeing honest or parent      just somebody that is safe and it will be easier for you to talk about it and come to insights  Ahh ok I understand nowhang in there  been exactly where you are   if you need to vent or a friend  i'll listen   message me True  Live and let live  I guess  It basically leaves any other real  actual food  I look at this way  anything that can be grown or hunted and eaten without modification processing  Just about any fruit or vegetable can be picked right off the plant and eaten  Technically most meat can be eaten raw  however  we've found cooking it kills bacteria so we cook most animal meat  By "modification processing"  I mean adding a bunch of sugar and other chemicals or taking out all the fiber  It surprises me how much sugar is sometimes used to make some brands of beef jerky  and fruit juices may as well be a sugary soft drink once you take out all the fiber   I gave up all bread a long time ago  except for a few times a year  It's really hard to avoid dressing around the holidays  I don't know of any grains that could be eaten right in the field  so to me it possibly something we should not be eating  I am also trying to stop eating diary  but I love ice cream and cheese  however  I didn't realize just how much of the world cannot digest diary   Typically I try to keep my diet mostly to these groups     salmon  usually the canned style   eggs  chicken  bacon  really any type of meat except canned tuna  it can have a lot of mercury   or meat jerky of any style that doesn't have much sugar  0g is preferred     almonds  pistachios  other nuts that have more fiber than sugar in the carb content   broccoli  califlower or other non starchy vegetables  no potatoes or corn    Fruit  any real actual piece of fruit  no fruit juice   I still buy junk food more often than I should and someone brings something bad to the office pretty regularly  but main diet is to try and avoid as much sugar and non fiber carbs as possible  It's helped me loose and keep off 100 lbs of weight  It's a case by case basis  There is no one answer for something like this  There are factors and variables such as home life  school situations  friends  social and cultural pressures and stigmas  And yourself  It's a simple question with no straightforward answer  It's possible she has other reasons for breaking up with you   maybe something she can't or won't want to explain to you  so she's just going to say it's the drinking issue to keep things easy on her   Also  she doesn't think this other reason is fixable  maybe she's just not into you  man    The drinking issue is not a great reason  but not terrible   Your drinking sounds pretty normal   Some people come from a family of alcoholics and just don't want to be with anybody remotely like that   You are teenagers   there are other women out there   I'd suggest accepting the fact that you aren't going to be together  then having a quick conversation stating that and suggesting being casual friends and ending her freeze out She's pretty much using you as a link  Tell her if she wants to be friends that's fine but you aren't the middle man and won't be passing along anything anymore  If she cannot respect that then kick her to the curb  Again  list out areas of interest and I'm sure people can recommend ways to begin I used to do that so to get over it I either focused on her eye color or something of that sort or looked just to the left of her left eye  or right of her right eye   You're missing the point  some such person certainly exists   And I chose heroin because it causes less damage to the body   in terms of telomere damage  http   europepmc org articles pmc4229419   than sugar does   Heroin  unlike meth cocaine  doesn't necessarily age you faster than average  Quick Question  Are you religious  That is  in the sense that you reject experimenting outside the norm  Because that curiosity or action is not bad in itself    I'm not trying to ignore your feelings  just provide another perspective  As Rocky Horror Picture Show says  "Give yourself over to absolute pleasure " It's all right to let loose I went to college at the usual time but went back at 48 for a master's   And I work at one now  it's informal here  Hi  I'm Bob  your instructor   not so much elsewhere  When in doubt  go sir ma'am and let them correct you if they feel like it   Don't do "professor " because some of them aren't    Attitude from instructors professors towards older students is generally good   I had one guy tell me  "I like a mature thinker " and you might get some of that  I guess it's a change from 19 year olds     The other thing  when a prof is full of shit  you'll know it  and the kids not so much   There are those instructors who get off on throwing their weight around    not that many  but some    and you'll have to pick your battles   I dropped a polite email to one who I thought was way out of line    though we personally got along     and nothing bad happened to me  Though nothing changed  either  and I didn't push it    As for your fellow students  just be yourself  As a person of experience  you'll have your shit together usually  and they'll value you for that   Help 'em out a little  but don't do their work for them Thank you for taking the time to read that whole long wrangling post  it really means a lot    I know how much it hurts  but he isn't good for you until he grows the fuck up   This is exactly why I feel like I can't block him    I did block him  almost a year ago now  When he came back and didn't put much effort in at all   and I had to go no contact  At that time  blocking him was done purely so I wasn't staring at my phone waiting  So I wasn't psyching myself out every time I got a text or a call and having to tell myself not to get my hopes up before looking    After having done that  it not getting any easier  and  then  learning that the reason I didn't hear from him was because he went away to deal with his depression with professionals  Was because he wasn't in a good place when he first got back  To learn  he  was heartbroken I blocked all contact and tried getting in touch with me after  And not only was he heartbroken  he totally understood why I cut contact and was very apologetic  Part of me thinks that after all my trying  I'm the one who ended up screwing everything up    But knowing he's still been working on himself   knowing him for as long as I have   a part of me thinks he will grow up and figure out what he wants or at least stop believing he's doing this out of selflessness because he either loves me and is screwed up or doesn't and can't bring himself to say it    I just wish somewhere out there were the words to get through to him somehow  How shitfaced do you get  If you're still able to actually tell what's going on and you know it's bad in the first place I'm sure these are only thoughts and you won't actually do them I can't tell if you're just insulting OP or actually trying to give advice     How is OP supposed to find people they care about if talking to people  in general  is just a chore  There shouldn't be any shame in dropping out of high school  You have your own set of personal circumstances that should be enough of a reason to you for your motives   The education system has this habit of creating this shame system around failure or dropping out  But that doesn't make you a failure  it doesn't make you a waste  none of that makes you any less of a human being who deserves to be happy   I know what I'm saying probably isn't the best  but just do your best to stick around despite the circumstances  I know you're treating it like some far off distant thing  but if the thought is there it is kind of a cause for concern  But just do your best  one day you'll be glad you stuck around   Good luck  OP  If you wanna talk my inbox is open Going the La Fitness shower route  I think I'll be fine  Thanks for the advice No it's not weird  Ask her if she wants to hang out before going away  Ultimately if she blows you off its no big issue since you will be moving on anyway  I'm sure if he is your friend it's fine  Check out the book "No More Mr Nice Guy"  Really helped me a lot with the same issue  Not sure if all of it will apply in your situation  but just in case I wanted to mention it  Cheers  Find a partner who wants to consensually act this stuff out with you  I don't have a checklist for new people I meet  and I would rather not spend time with people who do   With all the different ways people are fucked up  socially active people included  not having any relationship experience past 30 is really not that big of a deal In all honesty  The reason doesn't really matter all that much at this point  She wants it to end  and has chosen your habbits as the catalyst  All you can do now is move on with your life   As for the distancing thing  Give it some time  Let both of you work your shit out and possibly try the friendship again  Also do NOT stalk her social media  If you happen to see her with someone else before you're healed  it'll eat you up from the inside out   Hang out with your buddies  grab a pint or two at the pub and move onHi there   I'm sorry you're having such a difficult time   I'm wondering if this could be Bipolar disorder with psychotic features   Look it up and see if it fits the symptoms you're experiencing   That being said  if I were you  I would go to the nearest emergency room   They can help you get the medicine you need to straighten things out   I understand that money is tight  but you must take care of your mental health So it sounds to me as though the unsavoury desires are fairly automatic after you get drunk  i e   you do not control them  The solution thus seems quite simple to me  Instead of trying to control those desires  acknowledge that they are there and don't try to change them  What you have to understand is that you are a human being with a will of your own and that each and every one of us have unpleasant thoughts   sober  or drunk   that we grapple with  It isn't the thoughts that make us 'bad'  it's acting upon them  I trust  then  that even when you are drunk you are in control of yourself  If you agree  then there's no problem Well  we had some decent conversations while we were eating  she did point out couple times about the awkward silence and that my hands were visibly shaking   D We then drove to the beach  her idea   since we had to wait 1 5 hours for the movie and it was very unromantic since it's pitch black  When we get to the cinema then idk  I just couldn't talk  2 of her friends were there too  I knew they woudl be there  and after the movies we went to my car  she said she didn't what to do in these situations  she hugged me and laughed and went with he freinds to her friends place  I knew she would go to her after the movie     Since this is my first date I was completely oblivious  when we were eating if I would keep a long eye contact with her she started laughing  I've no idea what that means    In the end I said I'll message her and I didn't try to make plans with her  since I figured if she didn't like me then she wouldn't be pressurised to say yes via text  She's amazing but I just fucking hate myself for not being able to properly open up and hold start a conversation  If she says no then I feel like I'll be alone forever  Also she did keep saying how she used Tinder only because she is really awkward too but yeah  no way she was as nervous as me  as I said  my hands were literally shaking     I'm not going to look for any grammar mistakes and I might have missed something but you can just ask me anything No unless you watch a lot of movies and tv shows and have a 4k tv  You're not actually playing it in 4k it's just an up scaled resolution Buy something you need not what you want  Just tell her you've got your eye on someone else Why would you feel guilty watching porn Wow  it looks good   From the way you were talking about it  I was expecting to find some problems   Everything's perfectly navigable and I like the design   Only thing you could add is a link in the description "As always  catch the latest TNB episodes right here on our website  or tune in on any podcast application  "  If you can  link the words "right here on our website" to the latest podcast for an easy hook to get people listening   we pump into sugar so a pound costs  2 and a head of cauliflower cost  5   Cauliflower is not expensive   Yes  we subsidize cane sugar  but that's not the vast majority of the sugar out there   What's expensive is eating out and processed food   Healthy food is not that expensive Hearing someone who has gone through something similar is so comforting Despite it being unlikely to be a tumor  anything causing severe pain for more than a few days should be sent to a doctor   Your gonna get a lot of WebMD shit in reddit so see someone who knows what they are talking about    Your body is telling you something  don't ignore it  Ok  First of all  you have the power to say no  You did  but his behavior continued and YOU still allowed things to go further because you didn't want to hurt his feelings    It's unfortunate the way things happened but I hope this teaches you a lesson  You always have the right to say yes or no and if someone isn't listening to you then you need to be firm and let this fucker know that you are not comfortable  Leave the situation    Don't do things with guys unless you're comfortable  And especially don't do things because you don't want to hurt his feelings  Fuck that  What's worse is you allowing this to continue and it negatively affect you in the long run  He gets told no and he possibly tells his friends and blabs  As an adult what I've learned from my youth is that words are nothing but bullshit  Only I know who I am and if someone wants to start rumors and call me a slut then so be it    High school is a phase  You experiment  you test the waters  Trust me when I say that there is better things to come after high school  Don't worry about what people say about you  Own who you are and be in control of you and always remember that your body is yours  nobody else's  YOU are in charge of it  Nobody else  this is kind of a tough call   i don't know what the job market is in the UK  but in the US its tough with a college degree and tougher without  walking away from a paying job is a huge risk   how do your skills stack up wrt finding work when you return   as for your girlfriend   i'm with the people who are saying 3 months is nothing   send her a lot of postcards  call  whatsapp allows free calls over wifi   facetime google chat  whatever   and buy her cool stuff   she'll be ok with you going away and returning with cool stuff for her     I feel you  Hate dealing with them so much  Total shit show  I think Vegas is probably too party for us haha   Seattle is coming up quite a bit   what's it like there  Lively but lovely If you already have an Xbox One   no  it isn't worth it   If you already have a gaming capable PC   no  it isn't worth it   If you already have a PS4 but no PC   potentially worthwhile if you really want to play the MS exclusives   If you don't have any other consoles and a you have a shitty PC   yes  it's worth it You could get an old camera and prop it up somewhere for it to record over night I really want to do this but it's hard when you're a  trying to gain weight and b  lazy  Gaining weight on a clean diet is definitely possible  but it requires a lot more effort than "dirty bulking"  I'm actually not even gaining weight that quickly as it is with my absolutely abysmal  calories are the only concern diet   This is more of a vent than anything  I already know all the ways to go about both eating healthily and gaining weight   primarily shakes and meal prep for the week  Just sucks because I feel like I'd be so much more geared towards weight loss  I absolutely love running for example but I feel really guilty every time I go out for a run now because I know it just makes it that much harder to reach my goals  But I guess this is how everyone feels   people that are trying to lose weight are obviously better at gaining it and vice versa  otherwise we'd all be the weight we wanted with no effort involved  Anyway there's really no point to this comment   They're both wood workers   I think I will be fine   Are you This  So much this Your friend is a thief  no way around it  Whether or not he uses the money for good or not  he is taking from someone else and stealing their money  Its the equivalent of stealing someone's watch so you can buy a game for yourself  Like the day i found out my sister is actually my step sister      that mom also had a divorce      worse days of my life but hey its the past and cant change it so i accepted it  my sister ran off and now lives on her own  I am the only one who is holding my mom and dads marriage together   Just hold it together and accept it for what it is     find out the real story and just be calm  I just stopped caring too much and accepted the truthI tried to find something  I enjoy going out with people for parties and stuff that's for sure  talking to people there and spending time like this  I don't really have any other hobbies  I tried to find some  I just enjoy reading reddit and reading about stuff happening and other people's opinions  this is the only study I seem to find     you would think considering the nature of the issue and the actual prevalence of fish oils in our culture now  obsessing over omega 3's   that this would be bigger news   its also from 2013 without anything else being said after the fact   not too sure how convincing this is I really appreciate this  thank you I FEEL YOUR PAIN  Ya just gotta sit her down and tell her what's up   I have a roommate who let his girlfriend move in and they don't clean anything even though they sit in his room and smoke all day  It's so frustrating and stressful when you can't actually go about living in your home without having to clean up after someone else  Stay strong and educate those without courtesy and respect towards the living situation of others Hey  just because you know there are people in the world who have it 'worse' than you doesn't mean that you can't have your own problems and sadness   In terms of your appearance  baldness is a totally normal thing  even for people your age  There's no shame in losing your hair  Sorry if you've heard that a dozen times before  but it's true  It's something that you're naturally predisposed to and don't deserve to feel embarrassed or insecure about  If it's worth anything  yes  some  people might treat you differently just because of the way they look  but most people won't  Contrary to how we might often feel  the people around us aren't just shallow creatures  Besides  anyone who's actually willing to give you a hard time just because of your appearance is someone that doesn't really deserve your desire for their approval   Also  I'm not saying this because I think I know better about your situation or anything but I still feel like it's worth mentioning  but a counselor will never 'cure' you  Counsellor's and psychiatrists can definitely help and be such a huge reassurance  but ultimately the healing you experience comes from you  If you have the power to hate yourself  you have the power to love yourself too   But seriously  super kudos to you for wanting to seek help as soon as you can  That's definitely a step in the right direction and you should be proud of yourself for it  Deciding to get help is such a difficult thing to do and you want to do it   Good luck  OP  For your exams  for your current situation  and your future  Please stick around  seriously  One day you'll look back and be glad you did I'm currently on my Christmas break but I'm definitely going to try meeting lots of new guys once I get back to school  Last semester I actually met many new guys and have gone on dates with a couple  then ended up having a 3 month fling  It didn't work out  But yes I'm going to start again    stay up on a free day all night then go to bed the night after at the time you want  You can buy traditional alarm clocks that are super loud and they aren't that much money now if your phone alarm isn't enough  If you really hate getting out of bed place it to the opposite side of your room so you have to get out of bed What what I hear if they are raised well and there parents do their job they should be golden  When you say he's on a path of self destruction  what do you mean   Is he just drinking more than usual and binging Netflix   Or is he taking up hard drugs and forsaking other obligations like work school etc Of course it's okay to get a regular job after uni  save up  and then travel   You're the one in charge of your life   Just make sure that your plan is solid  if you get stuck in a minimum wage job  you might have a hard time saving for the trip   Also  just a thought  but have you ever looked into jobs that involve traveling I'd nap a little  do your shift  when you got a day off then do the all nighter Six hundred dollars is a good price in a legal brothel   What you get is a clean and healthy woman and a safe environment to do your thing   When you're playing a game  you have to know what's happening before you can even have a chance of getting better   But it's like everywhere I go people are playing tennis and everyone expects you want to play tennis too   But I just want to play squash  but I don't know where to find courts or people who play that and I don't know the rules   And everyone says "go play tennis"  and I'm like "I don't like tennis  I like squash"  and they're like "if you want to do sport  you have to play tennis  you will start liking it if you get better" or something and I don't believe them  because I know what I like and it's not tennis  and there has to be people out there who also like squash  like me  but know the rules as well   Am I doing metaphors right  Username checks outI agree with  u LilithNeverEverLand in that you should read more about psychosis or schizophrenia  even if it doesn't ease your symptoms it might help you to get a better grip on what's going on  It seems to me that the not knowing is causing you just as much anxiety as the symptoms you're experiencing  Please though  bear in mind that although you think you might be presenting with psychotic symptoms  it does not necessarily mean that you are schizophrenic  I'm sure you know that  as someone who suffers with depression and anxiety  a heightened emotional state can cause your mind to do all sorts of weird shit that makes you feel horrible  inhuman and completely lost without any hope of finding yourself again   Let me assure you that that is not the case  Regardless of what is going on right now  you will get over this  you will get through it  just like you have managed to get through every other part of your life  But  the most important thing to remember is that you and only you knows when things are getting too much  If you feel like you're losing control  if you feel like you can't cope  now is the time to seek help    If you don't want can't afford to see a professional  my advice would be to contact a mental health help line in your area  Even if they can't directly help you  just talking to someone who is trained to respond properly to you could be really helpful  If you don't want to talk to someone over the phone  we're here on reddit for you as well    Stay strong  I know this must be one of the most difficult things you've ever had to endure   smile  everything you're going through is temporary  it may suck right now but I PROMISE things will turn around  they always do   don't cut your potential short for the wrong girl  wrong friends or an unsupportive family  member   it seems like you may be young  live your life  the things you are feeling and going through are only temporary     SMILE Depression can sometimes get worse in winter when there is less light  Or stress can trigger another bout  It can come and go   I got off antidepressants last spring and have struggled with feeling horrible every since  At first I thought it was early recovery or withdrawal symptoms but now I suspect I feel awful cause the depression is back and it is physiological in origin rather than circumstantial or caused by external events   So I suspect I should go back on meds too but I quit because they weren't doing enough   not making me anything more than numb and lifeless and certainly not defeating the depression  I've lost faith in medications as well  The doctors seem to prescribe somewhat randomly   trying this med or that without clear reasons and without testing or science or anything reliable  That's scary   Pharmaceutical companies aren't exactly ethical enterprises  How can we trust our mental health to folks who will do anything for a profit  Are they really doing their best to produce effective medications or are they just trying to sell whatever they can at the expense of human suffering  I don't know anymore  I don't trust them   I really don't know what to do No That's beautiful  Sometimes we have to take risks  Brave the fire  even if it burns you can still be reborn from the flames like a phoenix If you can't get her to see reason  you can always contact facebook to do a take down of the pictures with the report stating that you explicitly did not give permission to have them uploaded to a public pageComfortable silences are actually one of the nicer things about being in a relationship  A real relationship  anyway   Think about it  when you're just "being you" at home and not being your "social self" in public    how much talking do you actually engage in  You probably don't feel the need to fill up every silent moment with blah blah blah  right   You're being comfortable enough with your guy  and he's being comfortable enough with you  that you can really  really just be yourselves  And still feel really good about each other  That is a beautiful thing   Source  happily married for 28 years  so far  He has been binge drinking for 12 straight days so far It's really not as bad as you might think   When you get older  you'll understand this a lot better  but for now realize that the man who raised you as dad is your father   A biological connection is not necessary to consider someone a father   As long as he's loved you  cared for you  and taken care of you  that's all you have to worry about   If he's been an abusive dick  well  take from that what you need Yeah that's lame  I think you can scare her off my saying that you called a reporting agent from Facebook about the matter and pretend your on the phone with someone  maybe even have a friend ok the other line and basically threaten to deactivate her account    Or you can do one last stand and demand she have respect for your wishes  Keep saying if everytime she posts something or takes a picture  I kind of feel like she will need to be forced to not post stuff about you  No  you shouldn't put off taking your class  You should go there with your head held high  You assume they've been off having fun without you  let  them  assume the same about you   They don't know what you've been doing all fall  If you just present a good image you will find people who are willing to spend time with you  even if it's not the same old friend group you had before I don't really have advice but it certainly gives a new perspective to parents putting up pics of their kids  I'm a parent   I'm not sure you actually have any rights given you're a minor  sounds like she's being really selfish  Maybe you need to get a Facebook and comment on every pic she puts up saying it was without your consent  that might embarrass her in to stopping itCan the guy bring his GF   Would you stop him from coming if he asked to bring her All I can say is I know that feel  And it sucks  Maybe just try giving it some time and see what you can try later My brother is a tattoo artist and told me you'll always dislike it until you get the next one which then you'll dislike in turn   Maybe cover it in something better or create a theme  He saw an opportunity to save his own ass and took it  He figured it would be better to betray his "friend" than to lose his place at a university and end up where the OP is now  That's not what true friends do   and then people wonder why some of us are so cynical  I wish I was somebody's any number choice  Because time moves forward and does not stop  Since you don't have a Facebook  as you say   she can't exactly tag you and make it visible to  your  friends  They could only see it if she added them  or they added her  which I feel is unlikely    I'm not sure if the stuff she posts would be easily seen on google  but you googling your name should tell you either way   With her being so stubborn though  I'd look into whatever legislation exists on the subject of digital information ownership  It's all emerging type stuff  so it may not be as thorough as laws on other topics  But what I'm getting at is that even though "you're her kid"  there are limits to what she can do with your life without your consent  So  if it takes that level of reasoning  so be it   Another avenue might be to find examples of what oversharing can do and how dangerous it is  Stuff like testimonies from victims and videos about social hackers  pretty cool stuff actually   She's operating under the assumption that it's all safe  but she needs to see the  real  consequences that can happen It's one week   He clearly had issues you weren't aware of because someone doesn't do this for such a reason alone  You cant force them to like you can you  If she has no interest in you then move on and forget her  You already did well by making your feelings for her clear this is a different girl Offer to secure the website for them  at a cost   Don't do it   Your life can change so much in a few years  you could look back on this part of your life and see all the things that you would have missed if you died   Every day is a new start   You will meet new people   New friends and loves   Keep going You deserve to feel just as much pleasure during sex as he does  Just because you might feel like you're not getting anything out of it doesn't mean you should   Communication is key  Definitely talk to your partner about it  If the prospect of feeling inadequate during sex completely overshadows your ability to talk to him and be honest about an experience that should be pleasurable for the both of you  then that is something he's just going to have to get over   Tell him what turns you on and what turns you off  you guys could probably open up some exciting dialogue just by discussing it   Sorry that this sort of thing is all tangled up in some not very awesome things  but hopefully somewhere down the line sex can be thoroughly enjoyable for you again Have they done a cheek swab test on you  It gives you and your doctor a better idea of what medications will and won't work for you  and was pretty neat to see the results   If I remember correctly mine was fully paid for by insurance or I paid very little  To begin  I am not offering professional advice  but am instead only offering my personal opinion and insight   It seems to me that no one may tell you precisely what may be causing that use of  imagination    It may be of some use for you to note that I am using different words and terms than you used because no offence  but you are not entirely correct in your own description of that which you are aware of  And this is important   For example  your "brain" does head in any "direction"  It is your  mind  that you actually seems to lack direction because you have not been consciously directing it  Brain and mind are not the same thing   The brain is a physical organ  The mind is a non material human attribute   This isn't necessarily neurophysiology or psychology  it is a simple fact  "Mind" and "Brain" are two separate things   The reason I am trying to bring your focus into an appropriate use of language is because if you want clarity if you want to think clearly  to define the issue clearly so that you may resolve it more easily  then speaking or writing clearly will definitely be of great use for you   It is important to recognise the fact of the matter here because it seems to me that you have also mislabeled the act of kissing or  making out   and  kissing the whole time   Those things are not "fetishes"  they are normal and natural human behaviours due to the sexual and emotional nature of human beings  They are not only natural acts but also very normal and rather  regular  acts  They are not "fetishes"  they are simply human preferences  Again  this is not necessarily any form of psychological or biological theory  it is a fact of life  Kissing  or "making out"  and  looking into each other's eyes  are not fetishes at all  they are normal and regular human behaviors    Although fetishes may be natural and rather normal  they are not actually "regular" as individual fetishes  It may be rather natural and normal for a person to have a uniform fetish  but such a personal preference is not necessarily  regular  because most people seem not have it such a personal preference or "fetish"    Your liking for kisses and eye contact is very  very natural  normal  and even regular  We all like it to a certain extent and to varying degrees  It is not a fetish at all   Therefore  I think it may be of some use to think of what type person do you think actually has fetishes  If you saw an individual walking up the street  and you somehow know that they had a fetish  what type of person do you think they would be  Regardless of whether you think they are "good" or "bad"  moral or amoral  nice and trustworthy or shady and creepy  you would definitely think of them as sexual beings at some level This is a fact  The moment that you think of a person as "someone with a fetish" is the moment you think of them in a sexual context at some level  This is again not a theory  it is a fact  You cannot think of a person having a fetish without bringing sexuality into focus because the very nature of fetishes implies sexual contact or allure   Therefore  it seems to me  that you may need to reform your self perception  the perception that you have of yourself  You do not necessarily need to see yourself in a "better" way  but it may help you to see yourself in a  more correct  way   By that  I mean that eye contact  looking into each other's eyes  is not sexual contact all  It is just eye contact  It evokes emotion  Eye contact  can  be part of sexual interactions  but that is only  part of what it actually is   Eye contact  in a way  suggests trust  That is why many people who lie may avoid eye contact  because they feel may feel untrustworthy  Eye contact is something done from friend to friend  mother to son  son to mother  co worker to co worker  and friendly stranger to friendly stranger  Eye contact is not sexual at all in itself  In romantic relationships  eye contact may be nice  romantic  and emotionally soothing   "Making out" is in a way slightly sexual  and definitely has some sexual overtones to it  but it is rather more of a romantic and emotional experience  It is also definitely not a fetish  At all  I am fairly certain that most people in this world  probably 99  of all the humans who  have every lived   liked "making out"  Humans like to kiss  it is sort of our thing  Kissing is not a "fetish"  it is normal  natural  and a pretty regular human act  It seems to me that it is not so much a sexual act  but that it is more of an emotional and romantic act   Therefore  although I cannot tell you precisely how to correct your own thinking  I can reasonably affirm the fact that you have been misinterpreting your own personality to some degree because eye contact and kissing are not "fetishes"  they can be rather romantic and emotional acts  Therefore  I think that it may be of some use for you to stop thinking of yourself in terms of "someone who has a fetish"  and that you start thinking of yourself in terms of  a romantic and emotional individual   Facts are facts  Eye contact and kissing are rather emotional and romantic acts for the most part    If you are having difficulty accepting these facts  then it may be of some use for you think of who you would think of a person who told you that they liked kissing and eye contact  It would be rather unreasonable for you to claim that they have a fetish because of such a preference  Eve if they might feel some sexual desire because of it  they are still really  really  normal and rather  regular  human beings because of it  For the most part  we all like eye contact and kissing  and sometimes get "turned on" because of it  It doesn't mean we have "fetishes"  it means we are human beings   I hope that helps  D    P S    It will also help if you stop watching whatever type of porn it is that you have been watching up to this point  If you want to keep watching porn  then that is your decision  but there is plenty of "stimulating" porn out there which is not violent or rather mean  I am sure that you can find that you can find some much more emotionally healthy options than whatever it is that you have been watching  There is no judgement here  but there definitely are varying degrees of  emotionally healthiness   regarding certain forms of internet content   Second P S  Forgive me for my curiosity  but I checked your post history  and it seems to me that you definitely need to some "house cleaning" in your own personal habits  There is nothing wrong with watching porn  Sex is natural  and we are all here because of sex  However  having uncontrollable fantasies about snuff and rape is not a sign of emotional health  At all  I seriously suggest that you stop browsing such overly sexual subreddits   Again  there is no shame in watching porn  but no one can reasonably tell you that the side effects  intrusive thoughts of snuff and rape  are signs of emotional health  Therefore  I seriously advice you to do some house cleaning  delete you subscribtions to such subs  and focus on something more positive   It may be worth to consider browsing subs like  r gentlemanboners  I think that seeing attractive woman in a non sexual  in a social or professional context  will very much help you clear your mind and focus on that which is more positive for you  and for those around you There's not much you could other than drink moderately  And remember to have self control  Drinking is not worth going to jail  Is he responsive when you reach out to him  or does he shut you down A lot can happen in a short space of time  At 23 I was decided that noone would make it into my icy heart and I was fed up with everything  very jaded  I started dating my current partner and it all changed  I've got 2 year old and I'm 2 weeks from giving birth to our second girl  I was in a job I hated but I made the bid for a higher paid job likely because of my partners influence  he helped me feel like trying harder  I got my own place that year which he quickly moved into also  We decided within a year of dating that we could sit there  save up money and likely find any excuse to put off kids or we could think blow it and just do it there and then and hope the rest falls into place  I would recommend enjoying dates  I went on lots of dates and it helped me decide what I wanted from life and from a guy  If your end game isn't to have a relationship and it's more work hobby related then just do it  Also there's nothing wrong with enjoying right now  Maybe they all seem accomplished but are you happier doing what you're doing  There's a lot to be said for being content and reminding yourself why your life is awesome sometimes i feel exactly the same way   Lacking human touch leads to all sorts of negative thinking that spirals into a mentality of no drive or self compassion   I would recommend going for a massage  It's up to you  and the laws in your areas weather it's an erotic one or not  but both types will help in terms of establishing physical contact with another person   To see the other side of the coin       Currently working my ass off after graduating college because I can't live with my parents  It sucks  If I could live with my parents  I would move in with them in a heartbeat  Sure it's fun to live without them but I would take not paying rent any day  It might look cool on social media  but you're getting the better end of the deal  You sound very similar to me  I'm in the process of working through some negative core beliefs that set in during my childhood and adolescence as the result of undiagnosed ADD  The way you are analysing yourself and the causes behind events in your life in particular resonates with me   One thing I've found useful is understanding that the concept of 'a person' is created by the mind  It is not possible for you to not be good enough  It is possible for your actions to not meet the required standard for a specific task  but that does not influence who you are fundamentally  You are of equal value to every other person  You may find it interesting to reflect on the Buddhist concepts of emptiness and inherent existence I was thinking of putting a player right underneath it  Having it move would take it to the host site  libsyn  I think  An entertainment lawyer working out of Los Angeles would have cause to travel the world to work with celebrities and producers who aren't based in Hollywood  And even if you don't have a particular client to go see  you could head off somewhere to scout talent   Plus you'd often get to party on their dime  claim all the travel as a business expense  and the gifts aren't anything to sneeze at either you mean he made the worst possible move you can make with a woman  declare openly your interestHow likely does schizoaffective disorder seem   Apparently sufferers show many symptoms of schizophrenia in combination with episodes of depression and can even have episodes of mania as well   And if I just waltzed into an emergency room without care for money  I would only serve to dig a deeper financial pit   I already feel guilty for buying cigarettes  even if a few of my purchases were conducted in a haze They never did any tests on my whatsoever  All the meds where prescribed by trial and error and results were purely anecdotal  They asked me how I felt and that's that  No science was involved  What is the purpose of a cheek swab  What does it reveal  How does this influence a choice of meds  All this is new to me  Thanks I am so impressed with your bravery to confront this  All the best Like everyone has said  you'll be okay   These things take time to pick up   I start a new job in six days  and I know those first weeks are going to be a shitshow   As for feeling stupid  well  that is in fact that path to enlightenment   I used to teach mathematics  and I persist that the fear of failure and feeling stupid is the primary thing that keeps people from advancing   Or to put it in  I believe  Niel Bohr's terms  an expert is simply someone who has made every possible mistake in a narrow field No Definitely schizo  Please get help Hi again  I do not know why I'm writing this  but I just want to write  I have got some news  but all bad      Yesterday  I went to a bar which is a gay bar  well I'm not a gay but I like that place I know it sounds a little bit strange  Anyway  I was alone as always  I sat on the bar table  while I was drinking and looking around  A girl came to order  she was standing next to me  She sat in the chair next to me while she waited for her order to be prepared  I could say hi easily but I don't know why I did not  Also  she was looking at me and waiting to me say something  I'm sure of it because it didn't happen once  And of course after all this she picked up her drinks and went to her friends  I was completely stupid  I didn't even look her  I want to start with saying  unless you're qualified you shouldn't be attaching diagnosis labels to your friend  I appreciate that you have good intentions but doing so can cause a lot more issues than it will ever resolve  I say this because depression can cause the symptoms that you're attributing to ADD ADHD    I think the most important thing for your friend is for her to work on her communication skills  There is a type of therapy called mentalization based therapy which involves a person thinking about their actions and how those actions relate to their emotional state    You can read more about MBT here  http   psychcentral com lib mentalization based therapy mbt   This is a treatment used for those with Borderline Personality Disorder  although I think that it can be helpful for a wide range of social issues  Perhaps it's not the right thing for your friend to necessarily attend an MBT group  but it could be helpful for her to read about the therapy and to try and apply it in her day to day life    Inevitably  if someone is 'acting out'  it will distance them from others  The only thing you can do as a friend is to stick around and be there for her  You can't control the actions of others as much as anyone else  I don't think this is selfish but it is probably due to a lack of insight into your friend's position  It seems clear to me that she's unable to overcome her issues alone  the worst thing that can happen for her at this point is for her support network to break down  This will only compound her current issues    So  in summary  try to help your friend directly by trying to get her to think about her own emotional state and her triggers and maybe you can work together to figure out some small solutions  Indirectly  you can help her by educating those around her and making sure that her support network knows how valuable each and every one of them are to her  even if she doesn't realise it    To change the way a person sees themselves  the world around them and their behaviour takes a very long time and a lot of hard work  these problems won't fix themselves over night  However  with the right care and support you should be able to help  Hey there  Really amazing progress right there   Just a quick question   would you recommend Tinder to a 20 yo who is not getting much dates  If yes  what would be some specific tips Actually  thank you  You just reminded me of how useless this all is and how much people suck  I am deactivating this account   I was schyzo enough to think I would fit in a fucking forum or site   My sincere thanks   "Kudos for you "We talk normally like always in our group chat I am here to talk  and you are no way near fat  Mechanics Wise  Since 3 and Vegas VATS would pause combat   This was a throwback to the turn based mechanics of fallout 1   2   But in a first person perspective it was jarring   Ironically I played 3 and Vegas as a fps because of this   So I would say the one thing they got right mechanically was that VATS slowed time opposed to stopping it     Lore wise   The Brotherhood of Steel returning to their roots  And actually acting like the Brotherhood of Steel     Setting Wise  I liked how condensed the city areas were and that verical exploration was a thing   That being said the Commonwealth was a little too flush with plant life   Not enough wasteland   Item Wise  Power Armor  The good thing about it was it felt as it did in both Fallout 1   2  it made you a mobile tank   Where they goofed was giving you access to it literally 15 minutes into the game  Fusion cores were also way to plentiful to merit such easy access   I however will state these few things  Settlement building felt like it was an experiment for the next Elder Scrolls game   The voiced protagonist pigeonholes the games narrative confining the player   Most people learned hit Sarcastic always Sarcastic   And as I never was really a huge fan of the karma system  not including it was a huge break from tradition  Every Fallout game has included it except for that abortion of a game known as Brotherhood of Steel   Lack of a karma system made people feel that they were forced to be good  And they were right due to both the narrative and famine of opportunities to do evil   Beth tried to fix this with the Nuka World DLC but it still doesn't fix the core flaw   Sorry for the wall of text   I just love me some fallout  LOL i actually enjoy talking to youIt's good to see that the sex was really good  unlike the other report recently from a guy who said it wasn't all that good You should take a look at the "Whole30" diet  It is kind of like strict Paleo  but just for 30 days to see how your body reacts  No added sugars  fruit is ok in moderation   no grains  no legumes  no dairy   I am on day 3 and I remember thinking "but what will I eat    " but so far I dont think it seems bad at all for 30 days and I am really learning a lot about what is actually in food  Today I have eaten   Breakfast  Egg muffins with Sundried Tomatoes and chicken sausage  handful of carrots  handful of almonds  Lunch  Chili made with Beef  Zucchini  Tomatoes  Carrots  leftover from last night   and an apple    The hardest part is just meal planning and making sure I have enough food leftover for work As a 23 year old  Dude trust me  I know you wanna think that  but it isnt  I still feel the same way you do  less than when I was 20  but there is a long way to go and it's looking to me like the guy above you is right   Check out a book called 'Iron John'  I saw a guy below me also recommended 'No More Mr Nice Guy'  I agree with that as well but my personal recommendation is to look at Iron John first  Here's the interesting bit  I don't feel as if I'm losing control   I am typically aware of what I am doing  I just       don't realize that they are odd or inappropriate until I'm done   I do have control of my actions  I'm simply       laissez faire  as it were  Do date her  Remember this was the straw that broke the back  She's been slowly building up a dossier of reasons to end it  It's likely been over for a long time  If you guys have great sex and enjoy each others company then it might turn into an awesome relationship  Don't try to tie her down after being with such a headcase but be truthful if you feel the love growing  If she's awesome in bed and everything you desire from life let her know and who knows what will happen  My partner had broken up from a 5 year relationship a couple of weeks before we first dated but it had been emotionally over for ages and I was initially concerned I'd just be a rebound girl but he was ready to fall in love again   Yes  you are spot on  I heard of girls demanding  1 000 for an hour in brothels around Vegas and Reno  But the price is negotiable    Tip  Bring cash and only the amount you are willing to spend  Never bring your credit card   You get a better price if you are clean and well groomed   Dress nicely but leave your Rolex at home   Treat the woman nicely  like the unicorn you have been looking for all your life  for the duration     i can't believe you need to go to reddit for a basic thing as this      YES GO TO FUCKING HR    Do you have access to him in person or is all of your communication with him via remote means   If so there's not much you can do for him short of reassuring him that things will get better with time   Maybe send him links to lighthearted stories and media That is super annoying      "wow  do you have any care towards the family lineage at all  How selfish  You're going to regret this when you're older"   This one  in particular  galls me   If that one comes up again  I think I'd just say "It's actually quite unselfish  I looked around at the family tree and decided the world would be better off without that particular lineage " She sounded nice  even if its pretending to be a friend the feeling still counts  I heard some of them dont even do that When I eat sugar it makes my brain feel like fireworksThis is why their needs to be a dating site for FAs  That is exactly what all my friends and two older sisters say  they moved out and moved back home    Hope everything works out for you though man  seems like you are working hard now so you don't have to later   Look up "amygdala hijack"    That may give you some peace and perspective Yeah sorry it's been a long day lol  Like I said I've been where you are many times  The worst thing you can do is point out you were right   Emotions blind people to the truth  Well  you can read on the above comment the reason I'm skeptical about a group hang out  Anyway basically she doesn't feel comfortable around my friends since she doesn't know any of them  I invited her once to a situation like that and she refused my invite  on the other hand I also don't want to be putting all the weight on her to make the plan with her friends and invite me  Also  it might be uncomfortable for her to go out with me all day  When I meant just a coffee it truly was just a coffee  I'm not trying to get her back  I'm over that issue  I really just want to regain her trust and go out with her more often  I thought that it would be better if I did it gradually  Starting out with a short hang out  something simple  where I can talk to her and show her that I want to move forward and then we might move on to something biggerevery single girls   or just the ones you find attractive YES  Exactly  And it's the worst when I make a funny face   Its a psychological thing  It's admitting that despite having the capabilities to step out on the town and getting some girls  you settle for some cheap plastic fake sex  Taking the easy way out    I can understand where you're from and can completely relate on a lot of these  That being said  buying a Mustang does seem like an unusual choice for a young driver  and whatever means of transport they take to get around wouldn't really discredit that concern Yes  this is normal  When people are in a heightened emotional state they can lose their ability to think logically  Basically  your thoughts are just a result of your emotional brain taking over rather than your logical brain being in control    If you feel that these moments are starting to take over your life or you can't control them  this is the time to seek professional help  At the end of the day  if you're concerned enough to post on reddit  it's obviously bothering you a lot  Even if a trip to the doctor's means you get told that everything is normal and you're just over thinking things  not saying this is the case   if it helps to curb your anxiety then the trip will be well worth it  Schizoaffective disorder could also be a possibility  but a psychiatrist would have to make an official diagnosis for you   I still suggest going to the ER   Though it may put you further in the hole financially at the moment  it will be the best thing in the long run  financially and otherwise    Best of luck with whatever you decide to do Money  They just have lots of it    We occassionally meet in person  so that's not the problem  But we all live somewhat apart and have different schedules so we usually only meet on the weekendsPretty late to the post but really great job man  I hope things go well and you live a happy life together  But if things don't work out  which is very possible considering it's your first relationship   that's a good thing  You gained experience  figured out a bit  or a lot  more about what you'd like in your ideal significant other  and can go into your next date more prepared confident  Best of luck buddy  Great job glad to know you like so many things about these games   Game On remember to check with an actual neurologist first  From your side then there's nothing you can do unless you are prepared to deal with the staff side yourself and ask your dad for a job   Family business matters can get very stressful and often it's hard to get family to understand   Deep down your dad isn't stupid  he probably is well aware he was played but he also is a proud man who won't admit it  I wouldn't worry so much about it happening again   It could be much worse  For context my dad was violent  my family stole 3k off me and left me homeless at 16 so they could move to a different continent lol  Whoever think it's weird must be a special snowflake Well  it isn't warm  and it damn sure isn't the biggest university  but the engineering school at Montana State University is fantastic  They've gotten millions of dollars in donations over the past few years and have done nothing but improve their program  My ex graduated with his ME and got a job making 80k right off the bat in Montana  which is a shit ton here   It gets super nice in the summer and there's no lack of winter activities to keep you busy  I suffer from seasonal depression as well  but the city doesn't slow down when the snow comes so it helps a lot  I came here out of state and my tuition wasn't bad at all  It's such a wonderful university  I hope you look into it  If you have any questions feel free to PM me  LV is great  it's one of those you have to experience once in your life  Well at least for me  There's plenty of bars you can go to instead of clubs as well  Or Downtown LV     Seattle just feels honey with a good night live   plenty of things to do and see  I felt the same when I entered college and our teachers threw random IT terms around  Now it's normal language I mean there's no harm in trying but if it was said like that to you in her position what would you think Case by case basis  The best way to use beans is to soak  as was traditionally the case     For me beans don't work  but plenty of people have no issues  Try to learn to listen to your own body  Remember that once you finish a meal  you're not supposed to feel bloated  really full or tired Try reading English books that helps me with my Spanish a lot I lost my virginity at 20 to a prostitute in Amsterdam  It might seem seedy and I thought it was at the time  but it was the best thing I ever did    After that I started to realise that sex and being a virgin wasn't really my issue  as nothing really dramatically changed  Not true  As Diceboy74 stated  fruits are high in fibre and also many essential nutrients with much less simple carbs compared to classic sugar for the same weight  Sugar from fruits are also released much slower into the bloodstream compared classic sugar  low GI vs medium high GI  What does your body need to be healthy  When we eat  junk food  chips  soda  our bodies respond to what it is given with unhealthy food it responds slugeshly  But when you feed it healthy foods  such as vegtables  protein  fruits it responds by having higher energy  more alert  and overall feel good   Our brain is still a part of our body  If you feed it unhealthy things  junkfood  like bad memories  and self doubt  Your body will responds it will feel bad   So feed it healthy thoughts  your favorite movies  upbeat songs  good friends who are there for you  Your family  a positive future  Of coarse like anything with your body  you cant expect changes from today to tommorow  It will take time  and patience  But what you needs is for you  to want to change   Also if you think you are "wired wrong" truth is we all are  In our own way  every musician  famous actor  comedian has had bagage to hold  But that really hasnt stoped them has it  Everyone is born with untapped potential  some leave it and go their whole lives without ever seing it  Remember its ok to be afraid  We all feel it  but the heros are not the one that are fearless  But the ones who are afraid  but move foward regardless  Im not saying life doesnt suck  It does  it hurts and always finds a way to mess things up  But never look at life for what it is  Always dare to see it for what it could be    Work on your future  Plan ahead  get an education  Even if its a 2 year technical degree  Nurses are really getting paid alot i hear  There are even some courses that take only 9 months  Always seek improvement  you may not have alot off experience right now  But weve all been there  Remember take everything one thing at a time  You can only do one thing at a time  You can just train to be faster  and efficient  These might be empty words but believe in yourself  Personally i have had confidence problems as well  but currently im getting past them too  Ive gotten better at my job  and even been able to give public speeches at church  If a guy like me can acomplish something like this  I know you can as well  If you ever just wanna talk  Just pm me  You got this Holy shit  I had no idea    I wonder what the caloric value of those pre processed sugar beets is  compared to the final product Well I cant speak for most of things but you are most certainly not fat  You are also beautiful  It can be hard if you dont have a good support around you  Your parent divorce can be a very rough situation if you are in the middle of it  Is your mom willing to work on her problems  Can you guys go to therapy  What kind of support does your boyfriend provide for you I dated someone who went back to school after leaving the military  He was a bit younger when he returned  30  but his saving grace was the veterans center on campus  I'd definitely look into it and see if your school has one Does your troubled friend know his drinking is problematic  or does he try to deny it's severity or justify it because of the breakup It is a good idea  They offer less than what they want to give you because you   should   negotiate  You've been missing out on a lot of money it seems As a straight guy  this is something I kind of fear  Like if one of my friends announces that they're gay  and are in love with me  I'd feel so bad saying "No" and basically hurt their feelings  But at the same time  I'd feel no attraction  and wouldn't want to date at all  I'm into women  and not guys  So is Food Matters  Food Choices and Cowspiracy  all on Netflix I'm going to be 100 percent honest with you  You need to tell your mom NOW  In the long run  your mom will thank you for it and will try to make your brother a "normal" human being  But if you don't tell her  and she finds out that you hid something so brutal  it'll devastate her  destroy your relationship EVEN more so  etc  Tell your mom  YELL at your dad and make him think  Then  love will come back hopefully with time I think first and foremost you have to make yourself appealing to women  Do you groom yourself  Do you work out  Are you easily approachable  Do you have something to offer  Are you fun  These are simple questions you need to turn from "not sure" to "yes"    Women  like men  aren't going to give themselves up for a charity case  Something about you needs to spark interest in them  Looks are important  but not everything  Unless you're deformity level of ugly  it's not hopeless  Get some confidence  get some friends  become interesting  clean up your wardrobe  work out  and become sociable for better chances to find a girl  If you're not willing to put in work to make yourself approachable and desirable then you're either scrapping the bottom of the barrel or nothing at all    I hope this didn't come off as anything offensive or mean because that was not the intention  I don't know you so you could already be appealing to people but just not have enough chances to meet women or women you like  small town  work too much  not enough women where you hang out with  etc   Either way that's probably the best way to go about finding a partner   Wish you the best and I hope my advice didn't suck  Working manual labor full time burns through a lot of calories  I imagine your average lumberjack could eat a handful of sugar every morning and not notice    I think genetics still play the biggest part in longevity    There are probably bigger factors at play here  than coffee sugar  You should talk about money  maybe not in the interview itself but it should definitely be brought up before accepting the offer  I'd be insanely dumb not to do it because with most companies you can get higher than what they're offering you  See it as buying a car  They'll ask 40k but you can probably get it down to 33k  We've had lessons of this kind of stuff and interviews with recruiters from companies and it was brought up during the lesson that you should negotiate  Ask an employee there what he is making  ask the boss what they're making  employee not the boss itself     Thank you so much   I don't expect anyone to diagnose me  of course  I just want some kind words and some information   And you have provided     not kidding  actually that was the only reason for my i ever got interested in "lucid dreaming" and such  so i can create my own dreamsUnfortunately  it sounds like your family is jealous of all of your accomplishments and simultaneously passed off that they wasted their life   So  sadly  they take out their frustration on you because you did something they couldnt  lead a nice  independent life Does he have a brother tucked away somewhere   You need to follow your dreams  Tell your girlfriend you need to do this  and you want a better life for both of you  Do you want to be stuck in a office for the rest of your life  No  Go out there and goto college  Get a degree  and in the long run  things will be happy  It'll be hard  but it'll get better Well  the idea of staring at me the whole time while talking to me might sound a bit uncomfortable  she might still feel a bit constrained and that was not what I wanted  I wanted exactly the opposite to show her that we can put the past aside and start going out again  On the other hand  I can't come up with anything else  I think it's still soon for a group hang out  and I don't want to be rejected on a whim  I think that a place where we could talk while not having to stare at each other could work  like going for a walk  but it might sound a bit too romantic tbh  The positive aspect of a coffee hang out is that it doesn't sound too romantic  at least in my head  I mean it doesn't have to last a whole day  we can chat for an hour and then depart  if things become awkward  which I hope not  we don't have to keep it goingYou seem surprised by her response but it was pretty appropriate    This is a learning opportunity  If your conversation fizzled out for whatever reason  "Hey  let's talk" is a terrible way to get it going again  It's the same as sending "Hey" as an opening message on okcupid or tinder and expecting a response  You probably would have had a lot more luck with something like "Hey there  been a while  How was your holiday new years "  You know  a light opener to get the convo flowing again  "hey lets talk" is demanding  pushy  and puts the burden on the other person  When that person is already trying to ghost you its a surefire way to let them know they've probably made the right decision Good luck bro  you got this  You got now at least one person believing in you  don't fuck it up  DLol  man  you keep getting closer to a ban   I don't need to prove my life to some random on the Internet  Your questions are condescending and anyone who knows me knows I have no such luck  So please  continue telling girls they can't be alone and you'll see where you end up   Thanks    Im planning on buying a house in a year  and then it won't be bad  Only thing is renting where I am is crazy expensive  but I can't afford to buy a house just yet   I'm confident it's all going to work out  just a little tougher than I would have liked  Lol      Thanks I realize this may seem remedial  but previously I had come from a comapy with a pretty toxic HR department so I'm still trying to find my footing in a new environment  I don't have terribly good context of what my rights as an employee are lol Pardon the grammarSeems as if the choices are blowing your cover  or getting reacquainted with a friend who in the past has a history of money issues   To me I'd say don't let him near your place without vetting him some  Perhaps you visit him back home when you come back    I personally wouldn't rent a place and I don't think you should either  Tons of trouble and expense So They would also add a spoon full of bacon grease into the cup  I do once in a while  whenever I make bacon   Yes they worked hard  Unfortunately I'm a desk jock  but weekend warrior  So maybe not as long of life A buddy of mine told me something that helped me deal with criticism from idiots  Just end it by saying "You're probably right " and continue doing what you're doing with your life It's much easier to eat candy compared to consuming the same amount of sugar in a fruit  I like pears  for example  I can't eat more than 3 at once  2 is perfect for me    The sugar in most fruits is also absorbed more slowly compared to sweets  Sounds to me like their all just rude  and uninterested while being uninteresting people themselves  Keep doing what you're doing  Cant go wrong with that There is pretty solid amount of evidence that high carbohydrate diets promote longevity Why don't you answer the simple questions  Just trying to clarify what situation we're talking about  Do these questions give away you're not really FA   Once again these are just questions  no accusations whatsoever here Target has throw away phones  The most hurtful part was when I told my mom she didn't even ask if I was okay or offer a hug  She just immediately wanted to talk to my dad  I offered to wait and confront him together but by the time I got home from school he had already convinced her I was a liar  He actually confessed just a few years ago when my brother was in the ICU after attempting suicide  My father who is religious thought god was punishing him so I guess he sought to confess his sins idk  Then my my dad had a sad attempt at suicide the same was my brother tried which to me was so insulting after everything we had just been through  Only my youngest brother  not the one in the ICU  broke down in tears crying and apologizing for the way they all treated me  Even after my mother and other brother learned the truth  my mother never truly apologized for everything  Again  she can't cope with how abusive she was to me  She and I have our own separate issues but I still consider the way she reacted to that situation with my father as abuse  So yeah  even after my dad confessed  she still can't cope  They are still together and I'm only just now 10 years later in the works of getting us to go to therapy  It was only after I had my first child that they are now so interested to be a part of my life  So the ball is in my court now and I'm pretty much demanding therapy  So just know closure may never come  You have to learn to grow on your own from it and forgive  I'm more bitter this day from the actions FOLLOWING the molestation than the actual sex act itself  Just accept they may never acknowledge it even after something as big as a confession  If t happens great  If not  at least you will have gained your own closure  They are weak  You are strong  Know that  I think the only thing I can really say at this point is that you're not alone  I've posted already somewhere else about mentalisation tonight  I  personally  am diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder  When I get very angry  I feel like I'm sat in the passenger's seat while someone else is driving  I'm there watching but there's not much I can do to stop it  In one of my more recent episodes  I threatened to murder everyone who worked in my therapy center  This is not something that I would call 'characteristic'  I think that the point I'm trying to make is that I can't sit here and be a doctor for you  I can't give you a diagnosis over reddit and frankly  you should ignore anyone who tried to do so  However  I can certainly sympathise with your situation and I know the gravity of what you must be feeling     I've just taken a couple of minutes to look over your post history and I really do think you need to get some people on your side and make them aware of all of this  I find when I need to tell my wife something about my mental health that she might find hard to accept  the best approach is to tell her  in detail everything that is going on so that you can both come to a logical conclusion  I say this because  in your current state  particularly if you're suffering with delusions  it might be hard for you to link everything together logically on your own  I honestly feel that this is going to be the best way to gain some insight and figure out a resolution without going directly to a health professional    Again  I hope this helps   You're just weak willed and you should accept that or change  Prepare for the worse when you accept it though The title did not prepare me for what I was about to read   Frankly  no matter what John's going through  it was an idiotic decision to take those shrooms in the first place  I understand that he is was your friend  but honestly I'd save my sympathy for someone who deserves it   As for Mary  it sounds like you guys have somewhat different expectations when it comes to being together  If you're sure that she'd only want a casual relationship which might not remain exclusive  think about whether you're 100  okay with that  After four years and clearly a pretty terrible break up  if she wants to unwind a bit I think that'd do her good  If you want to help her get used to spending time with someone who's  not  an asshole again  you should go ahead as long as you're aware of what you both want out of it Talk a walk  if it's not raining   Get out of there  Head somewhere That would've been a good idea to mention  It's a broken chain on my middle finger  It isn't my first tattoo but it's the first one I hate hahaLolI think the moment you had to start putting in more efforts to get news or answers from her you should've start letting her go forget about her    Think about yourself first  you might like this girl but It does not seem like she is worth spending energy towards keeping her close as she does not spend that energy in return   It sucks though but you'll certainly find another friend   That's beautiful  I personally seen how hard it could be for suffering people to come to such an uplifting realization like this  even with support  You're right  and appear to be strong  judging from this one thing I read about you of course  so keep on thinking more positive like this  There's so much to love That sucks   Good thing is that you've met lots of people hopefully through networking at the position your in  Maybe those clients that praise you  have a job opening   Is there any room for negotiation for a paid position  Maybe extending the internship for a few more months in exchange for a paid position afterwards   If anything  take solace in the job well done that you have done  You can be proud of your own work regardless if it had external benefits Then again  why do you care   Stop looking at his stuff and get on with your own life  The more you are paying attention the more jealous you seem  Corn  HFCS  is subsidized in the US as well  I am FA  but why do I need to prove it to you  I know your game because I've been over it before with other people like you  I will say my story but you'll look for any tiny detail that's slightly off and then argue endlessly about how I'm wrong and you're right  No thank you   If I were to leave  Id of course handle finding a new roommate  my portion of the rent  etc and ensure that my roomies responsibilities are as few as possible   Well then I see no need to feel badly  as long as you let your roommate help select your replacement  Once a roommate of mine unilaterally chose  the person to sublet her room  and she selected an obvious slimeball who stole food and broke into my room and went through my stuff  3 It's such a lovely thing to hear someone have this revelation  It was a similar thought that kept me from doing something to myself quite a while ago   I'm not trying to baby you or anything  but if you haven't heard it from anybody else  I'm so proud of you  Like  that kind of thinking has the power to be transformative and you've gotten there   Good luck with everything  OP  3Hahahahaa So called cured meats have been preserved and flavored by the addition of various combinations of salt  nitrates  nitrites  and sugar  Examples of such processed meats include bacon  ham  prosciutto  corned beef  pastrami  and pepperoni   Ah  it's talking about processed meats http   knowyourmeme com memes shiggy diggyGood for you  man  That takes a lot of balls to put yourself out there      I'd recommend posting your profile in r tinder to get some constructive criticism  If you're just getting started with dating  then you probably need more help than most        Something else I'd recommend is either spoofing your gps coordinates or getting the premium service so that you can "practice" with girls from another town  It does   I'm so happy that someone cares   That someone relates   Thank you for understanding   Why not "no drinking" solutions  I don't drink because I know alcohol would turn me into a bad person and because I have an addictive personality  and a family history of alcoholism   If drinking turns you into a person who likes fucked up stuff then stop drinking  simple  It doesn't matter that you like it  or are you literally addicted so you can't stop Sir  I believe you're correct but the facts are that this woman has  11 pickles in her mouth   http   imgur com 861rksl   This is a moot point He should drink more  Skip right over those thoughtsNormally the cheaters always think the grass is greener when it really isn't  After you let the other person have your problem  yes  the cheater is the problem lol  the novelty of their relationship will fade  She won't be his "perfect girl" after a while OP  It's nice to hear that this has resulted in some growth for you  Hopefully  you'll just keep growing The advice here is obvious and I think you might know that  Maybe you just need to hear to leave him in the past or move on  but I think that the best advice I can give has more to do with how to move on    There might be days when you remember the bad times  as well as the good times of your relationships  If he cheated on you and you wanted to kill yourself there is no real hiding how bad some of those times were  What you should do  is try to add a negative to the positive times you think of them  Yes  your ex helped you out through a tough time but that's supposed to be the standard behavior of people you're dating  They're supposed to love and care for you  The irregularity comes from how you were treated  which means your ex is actually subpar in terms of relationships since he cheated     Leave him be and work on yourself  Work on finding a better person than you had before  If you try to work your way back to a failed relationship then no progress is made  Learn from the type of person that would cheat on you and trade up  Sorry if this advice is bland or not what you were looking for  I really hope the best for you and your future  Honestly yeah it's better then the normal Xbox Might as well try it  lunch is another one you could try  I'd avoid the walk because like you said  mixed signals but honestly it depends on her    Group meet ups would have been the better option but since she's not comfortable then you have no other option  It could also be her way of saying she doesn't want to pursue a friendship for whatever reason   Truth be told you will only know once you ask her over something with just you  Completely normal  don't worryTIL  Sounds exactly like OP's situation from how I interpreted it  Good luck OP Well this sort of happened to me as well  I was 21 when I found out  I have no advice so I'm sorry  There's just no rule book  Just whatever you do  know that you are not alone friend  It just plain sucks I'm in a social anxiety meetup group  Maybe I should start an FA one Well  if it's little  maybe you can get a cover up tattoo instead TrueSend them out     It's late  but not too late   If you find yourself thinking  "it's not necessary"  just remember that your wedding guests felt it was necessary to   a  take their time shop for you  and b  spend their money on you   So  don't leave them with the impression that you aren't grateful for their generosity      If pressed for funds for stamps  you  might  get away with not sending a written thanks to the close friends and family that you've already verbally thanked   It's not the greatest of manners  but it'll do  just don't make a habit of it     OP holy shit you've really beat all the odds by succeeding despite your kind of shit family situation  It might not mean much coming from an internet stranger  but I'm proud of you    his behavior continued and YOU still allowed things to go further because you didn't want to hurt his feelings   Way to victim blame  You're right that she needs to know that she can say no  but he clearly coerced her  He's making jokes about how he has mad diarrhea because of irThe excitement of sneaking around won't be there anymore OP  Their relationship will crumble  after a while  My personal advice  take it if you may  but I think you would be better off without holding onto to something that can really be false hope  You're only 19  It's impossible to force love onto someone  and hey  if it's meant to be  she'll come back to you after you're done  But you can not expect that  Focus on everything else that makes you happy in life  What does your father have to say  Is he around   I have alot of experience with lucid dreaming and it is great fun  Sleep paralysis whilst momentarily scary will pass and if you can train yourself to understand what is happening then you can get through it pretty easily  I got it only when I slept on my back so I never sleep on my back anymore and never have it since BUT I don't actively lucid dream anymore   HOWEVER       lucid dreaming can be quite tiring and can wreck your sleeping patterns which is never good for anyone with mental health problems  It can be good to get a fuller deeper sleep but usually shorter and waking up alot or so I found from my experience  Getting a good nights sleep is much more important for people with mental health problems   myself included    What I found alot more "disturbing"  maybe not the right word  was "false awakenings"  Don't know the actual term     where you think you have woken up and feel like you have woken up and appear to be in your bedroom and then you realise you are just dreaming so then you "wake up" again and it turns out you are still dreaming  and this can keep going for time and time again   so you keep thinking you are awake but you actually aren't  Very Frustrating    But if you want to try lucid dreaming then go for it   it can be very fun and try not to worry too much about the sleep paralysis   once it passes then you get over it pretty quickly once you rationalise it  especially if you are aware of what sleep paralysis is    Hope this helps  Happy Dreaming   Edit   let me add that I never had sleep paralysis before I started actively lucid dreaming and I've not had it since I stopped actively lucid dreaming  so I don't think it is something to be worried about  not that it can hurt you anyway  it's really just your brain waking up before your body does   so you are still slightly dreaming but can't move yet  I believe that is what the medical explanation is    I'm not a doctor     Hell nahHey stranger  sorry to hear that things are rough right now  I'm in a very similar boat myself  living at home with debt   sort of  working a job I can't stand and feeling quite lonely much of the time  I know what you mean about that feeling of "outgrowing" your friends too   I've been in that awful place myself before  Just wanting to sleep and never wake up  I wouldn't wish it on anyone  I'm sorry that you're feeling that way  I wish I could give you a reason to stick around  but I think that's something that everyone has to discover for themselves  What has worked for me won't work for everyone  I'm afraid all that I can offer is a friendly ear if you care to talk further  Not much consolation when you're feeling so down  I know  but nobody should have to go through that completely alone   Good luck stranger  I hope that you can see your way through this tough time and find your peace someday  Hope to hear back from you  Try to hang in there I think it's endearing as hell that you did that  good stuff Couple of ideas   Make a list of traits and qualities you find attractive in a mate  That way  you can clear your head of the what ifs because you have a road map for what you want in a partner  Keep the list to your must haves to keep from being too picky   Make a list of goals you want to accomplish this year  Start with small attainable ones to build up some confidence and momentum of success in your life  It will give you some focus and hopefully keep you from letting your mind wander about to the more melancholy topics   Go see a psychologist or therapist  When things that made you happy no longer do and you don't know why  that's a sign perhaps there's some depression going on   Finally  its never too late for anything really  Keep pushing forward on your goals and what you want to get out of life  20 is still incredibly young this day and age I normally do not do this  but I think this is rather a significantly important post  So  I am going to latch on to the top post for the sake of social safety   It seems to me that you haven't actually processed what OP just posted  He essentially fantasies of raping and killing people when he is drunk  Such thoughts are not signs of emotional health  and the worst possible time to have them is to when one is drunk  When one is most likely to black out and do that which one would normally not do   OP seems to desire kisses and eye contact in most instances but seems to fantasize of murder and rape when drunk  I think it may be of some use for everyone here to realize the severity of the situation  God forbid that OP ever gets drunk  blacks out  and acts out some rape and murder fantasy   No offense  but I think that it may be of some use for  everyone  on here  including OP  to realize what OP is  actually  describing   I don't mean to judge OP  but obvious even he realizes that such thoughts are not healthy  hence why he is asking for help    It is just plain irresponsible to advise someone to continue fantasizing of murder and rape  Please be more aware of what advice you give to people  Its actually quite fun  I work little hours  5 at most a day and make A lot of money because my friends other friend is the boss and hired us together  Its at a car dealership  Connections get you far man  My Saturday job at a resturaunt sucks tho  Don't really talk to most of the people there and the managers DO NOT LIKE OR RESPECT  ME at all  I did nothing to themMy apologies I didn't mean for it to sound so callous  Purely meant they have their health  obviously care about themselves enough to see a counselor and to try move past the trauma they were put through and try to be a great person despite being abused  I didn't mean to belittle the abuse  I just wanted to play devils advocate if you will and show her another perspective that maybe by telling the parents it would be a step back in their own healing and hurt their parents too  Sorry again  Good luck OPBefore Anders Breivik committed the shooting he was pretty much the average  pol  NEET though  seriously if he was born a few years later he'd probably be shitposting on  pol  and  r9k  Lol  that sounds horrible  Didn't you at least meet the person beforehand  Though it's hard to read someone's habits through just one meeting     I suppose you could say it might be human nature to feel betrayed in this case because  after all  you still are ditching someone  Even though rationally it makes sense  which is why I'm trying to get other peoples' thoughts     Yikes  That must reeaaallly suck  but hey  Like you said  You're a "stupid 18 year old boy"  And even though society likes to freak out about the consequences of tattoos being something you'll regret "forever"  allow the fact that the financial aspect of removal is something that isn't an issue deter you  It sounds like you're currently in the process of owning up to it  which means that one day  maybe you'll even be able to say something like  "Oh this  Yeah  it's something I got when I was young and stupid" and laugh about it one day   As long as it's not something that's crass or offensive  don't be ashamed  We all make mistakes  and perhaps this is something that you'll feel better about in the future with the gift of retrospect   I've had both gas and electric dryers   My experience is that the gas dryer dried more efficiently and quicker  but the difference wasn't so substantial that I would never again go with an electric dryer    With regard to the easiest transfer of your dryer to a new home  go with electric   Then you can see how this could be effective Thanks so much  this is great advice  You're right its probabaly not best to diagnose my friend but I thought it'd be the easiest way to describe her I hear you  very hard making friends  Everyone thinks you have an ulterior motive  Hard enough opening up to people  It's not like you can walk up to someone and say hi want to be my friend  That only works in elementary school    Like I said though recently I've had people say they wanted to talk and were wondering why I stopped texting  so they seem interested  Are they just clueless  I've just always thought I was super awkward and not good at talking  so I'm not too sure Strong username to comment ratio I dont really care about if its good or bad  What i admire is that he had the balls  and did it  Thats always a good sign  Now he has to learn how to properly seduce women and he is good to go  There is no shame in doing things wrong as long as you try to improve There is nothing that says you HAVE to hang out with family    Also  if there is anyone in this world you can speak openly to it's supposed to be family  Speak your mind  just tell they they're not gonna give you the day off if you don't ask  family only comes once If you think you're just unlucky then you don't really need advice  you need a charm or blessing    There are always things you can do to improve upon yourself or improve your chances  chalking it up to luck is one of the ways someone can stay in the loop  Sign up for Facebook and report the posts to Facebook  They usually take them down  just wait till you are successful and well off  and they come around begging demanding you bail them out  She was willing because she liked him and didn't want to hurt his feelings  Thinking like that will get you into sticky situations  If we go out and try to meet people  we are creeps  If we don't  we need to "get out more " If we volunteer  "people can tell you are only there because you want to meet people  not because you want to help whatever you are volunteering for "yes and this is why organ donation has been opt in traditionally but as more people are less religious and cremation becomes more the norm due to limited space and cost then organ donation becomes a given and zero reasons not do it  I mean  is that the only reason you're not going  You'd have to share a hotel room  In my experience  when I travel I'm only really in the hotel room to sleep anyway  Otherwise I'm out and exploring  Even if it's not a destination city  there's probably enough to do and see when you're out and about   What's so bad about sharing a room with her parents  As long as neither of her parents is a hardcore snorer  it shouldn't really be much of an issue at all Is the reason for sharing a hotel room because of money  If you have the expenses look for your own hotel room or airbnb  I'm also 5 years in a relationship with my boyfriend and it would be odd to share a room with his parents or vice versa   If you can't possibly spare the expense  stating your feelings to your gf would be good    It never gets easier  Breakups are a part of life  though Thank you for the quick response  and sorry for my slow reply  I took your advice and got an extension  and have it all finished now  Once again  thank you I hear what you're saying  but I disagree with you  I think a lot of people have what would traditionally be described as dangerous or unhealthy thoughts  and they find ways to manage and normalize them  OP is thinking of these things in a sexual context  OP wants to get off  not to actually kill or rape people  Plenty of people are into BDSM that incorporates rape and snuff play  And there is nothing wrong with doing that in a consensual manner with proper boundaries  To normalize it will help OP channel it into positive things I can relate  sucks knowing realizing that ive missed so many milestones in life like first kisses and losing virginity  unlike most guys who get that done way earlier  23 hereDon't know where you live but your company might even have paid bereavement leave  Just call them and say your grandpa died and your taking a couple days off  Don't ask  tell  Ask if they have bereavement paid days off and if not just say that's fine you'll take it unpaid  If your boss is nice he might pay you anyways or ask if you want to use a sick vacation day  It happens all the time don't worry about it too much  Source  used to be HR manager  What's unusual about it   In general  foods closer to the state that our bodies have evolved with usually can be handled by the body  simply because we've had a lot of time to adapt   When you isolate and concentrate a single compound it strips other element of that food that might help our bodies handle it normally   Sugar seems so elemental  like salt  black pepper  etc   But this video shows that sugar is something completely different  it didn't matter what i said it would've ended the same this is the same girl who didn't want to hang cause "her feet hurt" i was just checking in on her but i guess i deserved that anyway  I agree with SoupyWolfy  If you don't want to be around them then go out and do things  As for sleeping in the same room  that shouldn't be a big deal considering it is only for a weekend  Worst case scenario offer to get your own room with your girlfriend   The sugar in most fruits is also absorbed more slowly compared to sweets    How come  Not that I disagree with you  but I've been wondering about the differences between sugar in fruit and sugar in junk food    I'm not sure whether it would be a case of resuming the second semester or repeating the entire year  What I do know is that it is possible to apply for a leave of absence and  if done before 9th January  then I'll be liable for only 25  of the fees for the academic year as opposed to 50  after that date    So it would be possible to take the time out and to get my own issues hopefully resolved and then contact the university about resuming the rest of the studies  Although academic fees may not be covered by loans although they aren't overly high where I live  Northern Ireland     The main reason I want to take the time off is because I really can't find any motivation to do anything  Literally nothing interests me anymore  Which means that I never go out to socialise  I don't have any hobbies and my overall self esteem has just plummeted  Where it comes to doing work I just can't bring myself to do it as  as mentioned before  all I can think about is how much I resent my current situation and how much I would like everything to change    Right now I don't even have an idea for my dissertation and it's going to be due in April  March and I feel as though the only chance I have of actually being able to produce it and to meet the demands of the other modules would be to take the time out and work on that outside of the academic year without the other pressures   For what I'd want to do with the time there are a number of hopes I would have to make the choice worthwhile which would be    1  Establish a plan  namely identifying a research area  and take the first steps towards completing my dissertation   2  Recommence my driving lessons and make a push to pass my driving tests  which would then allow me to live at home and travel to university when I return     3  Get my own mental issues resolved or managed as best as possible  Namely because of the low esteem  poor motivation  and dark thoughts that have been constantly plaguing me   Those would be the main aspirations for taking the time out although there would be other potential aims such as getting out of the country for a while  improving my physical health and maybe finding some part time work  Although these aren't as important and aren't the main focus   I see that I've kinda blurted out onto this and I'm sorry to anyone having to slug through this all  But that's pretty much my thoughts so say as you think and thanks    For me I rarely get rejected  because I fear rejection so much that I never put myself in a situation where I could get rejected No its just I am the type of person who looks at life as such that you only get one shot at it so why block off such a gaping hole in the human experience just to ensure that my wild and  possibly sadistic  side will come out   I am a 22 year old female virgin nerd so I don't think I'll be overpowering and or forcing anyone into something they genuinely don't want to do  and its not like some Dr  Jekyll  Mr   Hyde scenario where I transform into some animalistic beast and crave human blood or anything   I am just afraid that if I meet someone at a bar or other social gathering and ask for their consent to choke me out or hurt me while in a drunken slur I do not scare them off They do care though    that's why they ditched fat in the 90s  And everyone loves fatty foods   If all the scientists said it was carbs and sugar that is giving you all heart attacks  I'm sure they would have followed  Hey take it from me  life can change very quickly   Only 6 months ago I was screwed out of my career  very long story  and stuck in so much bad debt from a previous relationship that there was a very real possibility of me going to jail over it  debtor's prison exists    Skip ahead to now and I have a job where I am making more than I am spending for the first time in my life  I have stable living quarters and I can purchase food and I'm able to slowly climb out of debt and all of this has happened since the beginning of last August and only because I made myself available for any opportunities that presented themselves   The point here is that life changes quickly and opportunities do pop up  you just have to be vigilant and willing to move forward and make yourself available for them  if you do this life seems to sort itself out somehow        PS    for anyone who is annoyed by my parentheses  the switch on my nine key is dead so I don't have a way to open them properly    well your buddy just wrote himself out of the story  and that's the way it should stay  Your thing with her  go into it with your eyes open  and before you take the leap  agree on what is going to happen if it doesn't work out  because if it doesn't work out  you could still have a friend in her be honest    Her Dad is indeed a hardcore snorer  but I am an awkward person and being in a situation where I can't escape to somewhere private is bothersome because I have terrible anxiety  also it's in Ohio  I've never been to Ohio  so I am not sure what there is to do there Very proud of you   Someday I hope you look back and you don't hurt anymore   It will just take time It should be understandable  Most companies only give you bereavement leave for immediate family members  but some companies include grandparents in there too  You might be able to get the day off anyway if your company allows it   If not  it should be pretty understandable for you to take one day off  Any of the places I've worked wouldn't hold that against you  Even if it's an hourly position where attendance is tracked  one day shouldn't be a big deal  Yeah  call your 2nd level manager and let him know  If this is like an office job  then shoot an email out to your boss and team to let them know  Otherwise maybe it makes more sense to count on the 2nd level manager to relay the news that you won't be there   If they really bust your balls about not showing up for work the day after a close family member has passed  then that's a pretty shitty workplace  Most should be understanding of the situation  You might want to give them a little more info around your plans  Why do you want to go to your grandparents house if your grandpa just died  Is it to be with your grandma and keep her company  You might want to say that part of it too   The other thing to keep in mind is that he'll likely have a funeral date set pretty soon  so are you expecting to take that day off as well  Sometimes you'll luck out and it will be on a weekend  but often it's on a weekday I'm glad that I could be of some help  Please don't feel bad about the diagnosis thing  It is 100  natural to try and attribute labels to someone's behaviour to make it easier to order in your head but it can also create red herrings where you're essentially trying to fix the wrong problems    The most important label anyone has is that they're a person and  regardless of how difficult their mental health problems make them seem  they just need a little care and compassion  You need to stop thinking of "normies" as a collective group of people  It's a very large sampling of people with lots of varying opinions  Some won't want anything to do with someone with no experience  Others will be hesitant  Some won't care at all   Would I date a "normie " Absolutely  As long as she were willing to deal with my insecurities and uncertainties I would like to add I did not  and or  do not mean any sarcasm or snarkiness in my response just now Wait until you are past thirty  You are still a late bloomer  In a couple of years you'll be a monsterJust honest discussionYeah  they want a bf gf to practice English on  You can spot them pretty quickly  They're the ones who want to eat "raw fish" and "riceballs" with you   shakes head disapprovingly          Fortunately  most people here are fantastic  Confidence is sort of an over arching term if you think about it  There's a lot of different ways to display confidence or feel confident in  Like some might look at projecting a more positive mood attitude as being confident  I'm just taking a shot in the dark but I think confidence translates into dates because confidence is a sort of "display" of stability  I'm talking mental  emotional  maybe even just in their lives in general  a lot of girls don't want to babysit some guys emotions or deal with self depreciating behavior  A lack of confidence to a girl says that there's someone wrong    that's just my take on it Probably not much  I'd imagine it's all fiber and water  which technically have calories but pass through your system  £5000 is not enough to get depressed over  It's not unsolvable  Therefore  check  r personalfinance  Don't keep things on a credit card  You'll pay too much interest  On the short term move everything to a proper loan instead of a credit card  Making money in a shitty job is easier if in the back of your mind you keep counting down until your finances are under control enough to quit that job   Regarding your partner  Don't stress your partner  but do tell her in a calm way  Your partner would hate it of you don't have trust to tell what's happening   what's on your mind My unsolicited advice    You seem to be bringing jerks into your life  My advice is this  Cut them out of your life  You wouldn't be sharing if it didn't hurt you in a way  or at least knew it was wrong  You need people in your life that build you up  Not tear you Down  I'm sorry this keeps happening to you  We may not know you  but we still care about you and your future      Also    my advice for the future  Before going on a date  stay in the mindset of determining if they are using you or not  You seem to be bringing really selfish people into your life  The last girl noticed that in herself  this girl hasn't  People tend to follow a trend  I don't want this to be yours    Stay strong  my friend  I wish you the best    Edit  word choiceI'm guessing it's a hint   vegetable oil  Seriously  thanks man i'm trying to do betterGlad to know that I'm not alone Everyone in movies and TV is always having sex  Even losers  He was pressuring and coercing her  He's the one at fault  Here's a few ideas you can try to get some life focus   Make a list of things you did for hobbies or are generally interested in  Rank them and for each item you have  find out what kind of professions are centered around that item   Don't be discouraged if you aren't in college or whatever for a year or two  The money you make working is valuable when it does come time to go to school   You have to remind yourself of your strengths and why people can rely on you  Think back on your successes in life and it made you feel when you accomplished something  Remind yourself of those feelings when you tackle new things   To be yourself  you have to know yourself  make a list of your likes and dislikes  funny or interesting things about you   When meeting new people  you can easily keep conversations going by first asking questions that you can relate to  For example  if you enjoy a particular sport  ask them what sports they like  if any   that way  when they ask about you  you have something to respond with  Even better would be to take their answers and relate them to your own  It helps build stronger bonds between people  Make sure to keep a balance between talking about yourself  and asking them questions   It's hard to maintain a relationship with someone at a level lower than what you want it to be  friends vs lovers   It often ends up being a reminder of how you really feel about a person and how you can't get that feeling reciprocated  You might want to consider cutting ties  or limiting contact  at least for a little while   Hope some of this makes sense and is useful  You have a lot of years left  and one just started  Make the most of it Wherever you go  you can pull up TripAdvisor online and see a list of the top X things to do in whatever city you're in  Whenever I travel somewhere  I look up stuff to do there ahead of time  or sometimes even on the fly  and you'll find some pretty cool things to do   Most likely if you're in town for just the weekend  the wedding is going to take up all of your time  If you get there Friday night  maybe you can go find a nice place to eat or go see one thing before turning in to bed  Then Saturday will pretty much be consumed by the wedding  Maybe you'll get a chance to go out a bit in the morning  but otherwise you're in the wedding all day  Then Sunday you leave  right  So it's not like you're going to be spending oodles of time just hanging out in the hotel room  If you need some privacy for a little bit  go in the bathroom and pretend to take a dump  or just go for a walk around the hotel or maybe outside if it's not too cold   As far as the snoring goes  you should be able to handle one night  Bring some earbuds or something to drown out the sound  If it's really so terrible  then get your own room yea i assume but she did turn me down so it's confusing Not just me then  26 and feeling the exactly same lately  tried so hard to get a career in 3D graphics doing what I do and it just hasn't happened yet  I've not had many meaningful relationships either so that sucks too  little freckles puts the situation rather nicely thoughIf one was invalidated  insulted

recently in the job  I'll try to give him more info about the situation  it would mainly be support for my gran and mum as well as helping out for some housework or whatever needs doing as they shouldn't need to think about that at this time  It would likely just be for tomorrow and the day of the funeral I would ask about taking off  I think on the whole it is probably better to be keeping

Trust me it isn't  As long as you are alive  things can change  They can get better   Fuck  I hate saying that  "It gets better " That sounds so ridiculously trite  But you won't always feel this way  Sure  you may feel this way more than once in your life and you may feel this way for a long time  but this desire for death isn't permanent    Trust me  Get help  Even if it's just online therapy  MoodGYM is a free one   It's painful  it's hard  it's boring  but you have to get out of your box  Do something  Anything    The only time that you can't change things for the better is if you are

would work    Talk to this person and explain the situation  Ask them to talk to your mother on your behalf   This might be a casual conversation that leads by example "so redrocketmum  I was reading this article about how harmful it is for kids to have their whole life constantly splashed all over social media  Really makes you think  doesn't it "   Or it might be a more formal conversation  "Redrocketgirl has asked me to speak to you  she is very upset about having her personal life posted on Facebook all the time and feels as though her objections are not being taken seriously "  It will depend on how you mum is likely to react  also who you end up asking for help  Discuss this with them and decide together the best course of action    Good luck   Nearly any larger stores  including drug stores  have "pay as you go" phones  and phone plans   It seems to me that you are not recognizing one obvious fact  which is that OP  is not  actually into BDSM  rape or murder     He   She clearly  and very clearly  stated   his   her personal preferences in    I am actually more into sensual fetishes  like making out the whole time  or stare into each other's eyes the whole time   So there is no need to "normalize" OP's  undesired  thinking habits    He   She clearly stated that   his    her preferences  that   his   her"fetishes" are eye contact and kissing    He   She seems to be only having rape and murder intrusive thoughts when drunk  There is not need to "normalize" the problem here  a problem that even OP seems to recognize as a problem   I mean  seriously  there is not way that   he   she  or anyone  can "normalize" rape and murder  There is no way that such things can be "channeled into positive things"  There is absolutely nothing about rape and murder  I mean seriously   BDSM is completely different from rape and murder fantasies  Those are two completely different things   I don't see how  The video shows nothing shocking or surprising  It's boiled down

Why do you think your parents will feel like they failed   EDIT  Nevermind  I looked at your post history and it seems like this is about porn   Overall you shouldn't feel bad for looking at porn  Every boy does as they enter your age bracket  I was looking at it starting from when I was 10 11  and it only got more intense as I entered my teenage years  At that age  it's all you really have  There are no true boyfriend girlfriend relationships at your age  Maybe a couple kids are getting together  but by far everyone is still too young and has no experience with that stuff   It's not until you get into your later teens that you even have a chance at getting with a girl  In the meantime  there's nothing wrong with having a wank and looking at porn  I would do it several times a day when I was in my early adolescent years  You'll even out over time  So long as it doesn't consume your every waking moment  you should be fine   Your parents haven't failed  You're not a bad kid for doing what you do  Everyone masturbates  guys and girls Thank you that makes me happy to know  Some advice from family is good  as in your case  All you can do is try  The problem is people who give bad advice have great intentions too  but they are just misguided and don't want to listen to reason lol  I guess straight up ask what her deal is Oblivion was a great game   I presume that if you love the Bethesda classics  that you have played their newer titles as well  right   Skyrim is like Oblivion  but better in my opinion  especially for casters with dual casting   Fallout 4 is a great open world RPG that is very similar to Skyrim   Its like an Elder Scrolls game with firearms  super mutants  ghouls  and a badass dog as your sidekick   Witcher 3 is also worth checking out   Guild Wars 2 is like a watered down version of WoW that is less addictive and has no monthly fees  so its worth checking out due to having lots of content for under  20   Been there before   As an interim  make sure she files unemployment   Even if she was straight up fired  because that's not an automatic bar to unemployment benefits  this is assuming you're in the US somewhere    Keep a level head  cut where you can  reign in unnecessary spending  and most importantly  remember that it's just a temporary setback   Something will come along  you just have to weather the storm   I say this as first person experience   It may seem like the end of the world  but if you're keeping the roof over your families head and food on the table  then remember it could be a LOT worse   I just need to find the number of my bosses boss  I don't mind taking it unpaid  I think even 1 day would be okay  I just want to be there for close family members the day after his passing  One day might be okay though as I think I would rather be kept busy Like buying used things and selling them She is not the kind of girl to go out that often  she is also shy and introverted like me  so I understand what she feels about going out to some extent  I think she would tell me if she didn't want to keep being friends anymore  she knows she can talk about anything with me  also I keep talking to her online quite often and she is always really responsive  I don't think anyone would put so much effort into a friendship if they had no interest in it  And it's not like our friendship is based on favors or something  she never asked me for a favor  I even offered to giver her a ride to her college more than once and she said she didn't want to bother me  So  like I said I don't think she would put so much effort into this kind of friendship if she didn't enjoy speaking with meAnd she gave in   she has the power to say fuck you  stop and get out of that car  Unless someone is over powering you  there's always something to be done  Women need to stand up for themselves and take no shit from nobody especially a dumb horny teen who's just trying to get his dick wet  Were you regularly

if you don't mind me asking  Check   Mate yea benwi24 you got a point i don't want too get lead on In my experience it starts from not meeting expectations as a child  and despite reassurance that

used minoxidil for balding before with no results  I've also heard about it being used for beard growth  For scalp  minoxidil is pretty damn safe  I understand that using it on the face is slightly more dangerous since it is absorbed faster and stronger  but from what I read  it's only a problem if you use doses way higher than recommended How far North it is is probably a deal breaker  but I'll look into it  Thanks for the suggestion I guess so then    Might as well recreate the tune  finally I'm gonna put my musical education to use lolNothing is worth killing yourself over  Please remember

Thanks for clarifying the genre tho Hmm   Well i disagree with your last line    What you enjoy is dictated by how you feel when you experience it   If depression for lack of a better word here  effects how you feel then it will certainly stain your impression of some things      I guess what im saying is that it is within your power to change what you like   Its hard   But it can be done   Outlook is the key   As an example   talking to other people would bore me to death if the topic wasn't something complex or "real "  At some point I came to the realization that all people  no matter

all of which have much better than even potential of getting your mind out of the mental mush and into reality  A lot of these can be done to some extent in inexpensive workbooks one can find online  The publishers are usually New Harbinger or Guildford Press    I currently use Ogden's  SP4T  http   pairadocks blogspot com 2016 07 the 10 steps ogdens sensorymotor html  as the 9th of the  10 StEPs

psychotherapies I listed above I still remember 10 years ago facial hair was considered disgusting  so I never worried about my shitty beard  I don't worry today also  notice how those hot bearded guys are Chads  It's not like I even had a chance to compete   Same stuff with eyeglasses I know exactly what you are talking about  and I dealt with it all the time  This sort of depressing nostalgia is difficult to face  I found that focusing on the great memories works a lot better than allowing the vast darkness of the future to take over  One of my favorite sayings in this scenario is "Don't cry because it's over  smile because it happened "Before you accuse me or anyone of "shaming" other people  actually take the time to read properly  OP  clearly  stated that   his   her fetish is kissing and eye contact  Here  I will write it in bold for you      I am actually more into sensual fetishes  like making out the whole time  or stare into each other's eyes the whole time    I have clearly stated that there his kissing  eye contact  and watching porn are normal and natural  Fantasies of murder and rape are not healthy or normal  You can quote me on that if you wish  I will at least have clear conscience next time some rape victim or a family member of a murder victim asks for help here on Reddit  Thank you for your support  It really means a lot to me  I struggle so much with these thoughts sometimes and it helps to know other people share my struggles    I'm just so damn lonely I think    Absolutely  What you said makes a lot more sense than I think you realize  Because everyone actually plays a  different  game  Otherwise it would be easy to figure out  wouldn't it  It's not like a sport  or a board game  There is no objective  no real score  other than your own happiness  There are meta games that people play too  when they get stuck in societal ruts  and they aren't even aware that they are getting "played"  But the real issue here is control  If you've played sports to any level before  you'll know that control isn't what it seems  There's no "feeling" of control  it's actually a feeling of freedom  Because when it feels right  you don't think about the rules  where you stand  or what's going to happen  The game shows you and you just simply do  But that's beside the point   When you think you know what you're doing  you're believing in the illusion of control  You're rejecting the world before you even have a chance to look at it  You know this is true  You've been in situations before where your idea of who you think you are prevented you from acting along the path of least resistance  because that would have been like losing control of your self  and losing control is  scary   But losing control is one element of the game people play  Or it isn't  some people play a game where control is the rule  but like you said  they're playing tennis and you want to play squash   Knowing what you want is about knowing where your boundaries are  Within those boundaries  I contest that not only do you not know how to play  your  game  but you're actively resisting it  Some part of your identity holds you back  It's pretty clear to me that you're not really playing the game with awareness if you're not having fun doing it Maybe next time he jokes about it  you can discourage the behavior   If he's getting diarrhea because of it then it's certainly unhealthy   A lot of this could depend on his personality   I have a good friend who's an alcoholic and he would always make jokes and excuses for himself and his behavior in order to avoid confronting reality   Only when he hit rock bottom did he realize the severity of his problem  and joined AA   Of course your friend isn't necessarily an alcoholic  but you and the others in your circle shouldn't be afraid to confront him on his unhealthy behavior   Push him towards distractions other activities   If any of your friends have compatible schedules with him  spend time with him in person to keep him company and keep him out of trouble   I know this might sound like baby sitting  but if you can do it  it  does  help Would you date those people  They all have similar rock bottom standards Some do and some don't  but it'll Make my face look better and respectable so I really don't care what girls  think about it I signed up a long time ago You're right though  Nothing changes if I'm dead  I just hate this pain so much and I hate that it have to go through it  It makes everything so much harder  Ah ok  What happens if you display confidence and still single  Maybe I need more showers  LolOP is a woman  She stated that more than once  Also  she said that's what her fantasies are when she's sober  She clearly has other desires too  which is what the whole post is about  And you very very clearly shamed people who want to engage in rape play in your last comment  Everywhere  Literally any store with electronics Thank you  and thanks for your advice  It's hard  especially thinking about all the good times and how my mum and gran and his friends will cope without him  I definitely need a day  I'll send an email to my line manager tonight and will call the section head in he morning  although I'll need to remember his name first NothingJesus this is GREAT  It's easy to be supportive but this gives me real ways to help  Thank you so much for taking the time to give such an in depth response  This times a million  Go watch the movie  Fed Up  https   www youtube com watch v aCUbvOwwfWM  and it basically shows that sugar is in EVERYTHING    After I watched that documentary I started looking at every label I bought at the grocery store for my son and I literally had to change everything in our pantry fridge  I constantly monitor not only his sugar intake but mine as well    Tortillas  yup sugar   Bread  yup sugar   Ketchup  holy shit it's loaded with sugar    I was seriously floored at all the things that had sugar in the first 3 ingredients on the back  It makes shopping super hard honestly    Diabetes is a horrible  horrible disease and I would feel so awful if I was responsible for my little man getting that disease early on in life  Thanks so much   I'm slowly getting better and I can promise you that you will too   That's annoying about the wisdom teeth too   Hopefully it didn't hurt too much   I'm actually 20 too but I got them out I think three or four years ago all at once   There's lots of blood but it'll be over soon How long did you use it Hi  OP  Not sure if you're familiar with any of these organizations  or where you're located  but if you need   want advice from LGBTQ friendly Muslims  here are some places to start  http   islamandhomosexuality com organizations    http   www mpvusa org lgbtqi resources   http   www lgbtmuslimretreat com   http   www muslimalliance org   Full disclosure   I'm as straight as straight can be  but I've mentored a lot of LGBTQ Muslim students over the years  so if you need an ear or suggestions for other people to talk to who are affiliated with the community   allies or fellow Muslims   feel free to reach out    I would speak with a lot of people   Judging from the username you have chosen you might want to speak with a counselor  yes   But I would also try to continue contact with the university   I would  if you can afford it  speak with an attorney  1 incident in 4 years while serious  might be forgive after a years time   Have you actually even determined if the record of what occurred would transfer to another university  No need to worry  divorce rates have been declining ever since their peak in 1980 Haha I'm glad I helped you even if it was just a little bit   Stay strong and remember that it'll get better Okay  LolI'm more depressed by the fact that they're not as fun as they used to be  I played Runescape for 4000 hours  and now I can't enjoy it anymore  All my friends know or used to play Runescape for a while  Occasionally a theme song will pass by when we're hanging out   I remember being young  not that I'm old now  I'm 19  and visit my cousin who's 5 years older and play AAA games  Now I'm just sitting here with Overwatch I play a couple matches a day  1h or less  and that's it  I can't enjoy Runescape  Battlefield  story games     anymore     My playtime is limited by college but at least Overwatch stays fun because I'm not playing it all the time High insurance rates  low fuel economy  not particularly reliable  a very high amount of horsepower for people who both don't need it and often don't have the experience to handle it  Mustangs are consistently rated one of the worst cars for young drivers for that reason  and I consider age 24 to be pretty young It's not really important whether you think this is a good idea or not  and I urge you to ignore pretty much ever piece of "bro" advice you're getting here  because a  nobody knows you and b  this is  r socialskills  what do you expect    and you clearly just wanted to communicate your progress to peeps here  and that's great  Hopefully someone will find strength in your experience and learn something from it  instead of immediately reacting by trying to tell you what to do I didn't even find about it until after it happened The alcohol isn't the problem  it simply brings forth parts of ourselves we keep hidden due to conscience  societal expectations  etc   Fact is  however  you are experiencing abnormal thoughts   If you choose not to seek therapy  it could become a serious problem   Get help  please  as many serial killers reported similar thoughts before they began killing The fallacy you're making is that your great grandfather grandfather father etc  lived similar to you   The sugar consumption is one factor   We live in a very different world than even 40  years ago   People rarely cook anymore   People don't exercise   My grandfather often went hungry during the Great Depression and I assume yours did as well   Not eating regularly is thought to improve longevity   I also assume your ancestors didn't eat like that when they were children   Also  they got a whole lot more exercise growing up and as adults   The rates of obesity and diabetes have skyrocketed in the last 30 years   100 years ago diabetes and heart disease in the US were nearly nonexistent   As you said  the genes are more or less the same   The good news is these diseases are highly progressive and don't hit you until you're 60    Granted you could have avoided them  but diet and lifestyle can even fix heart disease at that point and can manage diabetes   Cancer  well that's a bit harder   Just watch that weight  BP  and cholesterol   tldr  Go ahead and do what you want  but don't be surprised if it bites you   If it does  you should rethink why they didn't have those problems You're not gross at all I don't think  No one will really care even if you do something embarrassing  All the things you found gross happened to be in pretty early grades and the ones that you  found gross in grade 9  were accidents  You'll be fine  Don't worry about being 'accepted' otherwise you'll just be constantly thinking about it and every small thing you do might affect you more than what it should  She didn't state that a single time in her OP  Regardless  you are conveniently ignoring her thoughts of murder    I do not care about peoples sexual preferences  If two people want to act out some aggressive sexual fantasize then that is there prerogative  However    there is nothing healthy of MURDER and RAPE   fantasies  What part of that do you not understand  OP isn't thinking about kinky sex  She is thinking     RAPE and MURDER   when drunk  That is no sign of health at all  It doesn't take a psychologist to realize that  It is basic common sense   I can't force you think in any one way  Nor do I want to  But  is simply absurd that you and the people upvoting you are not accepting the fact that rape   AND   murder fantasies are severely unhealthy for everyone involved  No idea if I can make money with something that simple  Your right about it being simple though  I just used it as an example  I can do more complex things  Not super complex but better then that   What I was looking to do is figure out what people want then make it  I don't mind going further in this stuff  I learn something new every time I play with it   Other things I made   https   scontent dft4 2 xx fbcdn net v t31 0 8 s960x960 10295518 767622936590723 776172334512436930 o jpg oh

wouldn't believe you are being honest to yourself  I'll take you at your word  As long as you're not a dick to others then this is a totally acceptable conclusion of social reality  Good luck to you and your future hermit life  Can you explain what you mean by practicing gratitude and also practicing visualization Thank you so much  You were right I know I need to move on but not how and nobody I spoke with knew it either  Thank you for answering  Are you black  I ask because my GP referred me to a hematologist due to a low white blood cell count  He took blood twice over two months and I was freaking out about  HIV or cancer is what I thought  My yearly HIV AIDS screening have all came back with negative results so I was surprised  Thought it was cancer  Went to the hematologist and he calmed me down  Said it's most likely ethnic neutropenia    The white blood cells roll along the walls of the veins  As the phlebotomist nurse inserts the needle to pull the blood  a false count of white blood cells are taken  Most of my white blood cells are moving along the banks of the river versus mid stream of the river    Calm down until your results come back  Even if it's cancer HIV  it's not a guaranteed death sentence  There's life after  But   you don't know yet  Try to relax  Depends how attractive you are  attractive beard hunk  whereas ugly beard unhygienic creep  I suppose I am lucky as I was growing facial hair at 15 Could you elaborate more on the "mandatory" part of the camping trip    An imposed trip doesn't seem a normal situation to me  but I'm just speculating without context of course  Sounds like you had a good time  Obviously it's going to be a bit awkward because you don't know anyone but you managed to talk to people If it does it does   I shall smoke cigars like them  drink whiskey  enjoy my bacon flavored sugar added coffee  and enjoy Life as it comes Concussions are the shits  I missed almost half of my junior year in basketball and schooling  Some people say I changed  including my then girlfriend at the time  We ended up breaking up shortly after i recovered  I used to never get headaches  but after suffering through two concussions within the span of five months I started getting them  Some hurt a lot and some are mild  Have you tried visiting a Chiropractor or a Myofascial Massage specialist A year  But you have to take into account that male pattern baldness is a whole different animal  I've heard conflicting reports about minoxidil for facial hair  some say the results  if you even get them  are as temporary as those for MPB  some claim they are permament  Haven't really read too much about it in yearsI wouldn't call it sad  just nostalgic  Some games I can remember precisely where I was and what I was doing while playing them  I'll remember particular days or events that surrounded the game  I'll remember my emotions as I played the game the first time and experienced new parts of it   I recently revisited some of my favorite childhood games  Earthbound  Chrono Trigger  Final Fantasy 3  7  8  and 10  All these games had great music which just piles on to the nostalgia  It's fun to revisit  but the sad part for me is that a lot of the magic is gone as I replay it  With so much more experience in gaming  I can easily stomp through these games that at one point were SO difficult for me   Also  as I get more life experience  I get less swept up in games  When I was a kid  I had no idea of the real world  I was a dreamer with no life experience  I had to imagine what love was like  what fighting was like  what panic was like  and what being a hero was like  It was my imagination that got caught up in those games and brought them to a whole other level   Now as a 30 year old  I can't bring myself to invest in a time consuming game  I feel like with life experience comes cynicism  My imagination recedes into the distance  and instead of getting caught up in the story or the game  I will think "Wow  What great graphics  I wonder how long that took to program " or I'll think "This game has really great writing   I wish more games could tell a story like this one " I find ways to dissect what I like about the games and analyze it versus when I was a kid and just got swept up in the whole experience of the game   At a certain point you need to accept that you're not a kid anymore  You're growing up and you will have more and more responsibility  I just had my first child a little over a month ago  and I have virtually no time for games now  I can sneak in a quick 15 20 minutes of Rocket League here and there  Maybe I can get partway through or entirely through a full battle in XCOM  But long gone are the days of sitting in front of the Super Nintendo for hours playing Super Mario RPG  Even when I was in college  I found time to play WoW for hours at a time  Now  I can barely sneak away for a couple 5 minute matches without having some kind of responsibility that I'm ducking   But you know what  That's okay  I love my child so much  I love spending time with my wife  We'll watch Netflix together  go shopping  or go out to eat together  and that has just as much merit as sitting there playing a video game  I have a dog  and as much of a hassle as it is to feed her every time I walk in the door or take her out to pee poop  the dog brings me joy and happiness   Yes  I need to slave away at a job for most of my awake time  but it allows me to provide a good life for my family  It allows me to take my family on trips and buy them nice things  and soon to buy my girl video games so she can experience the same feelings you and I felt as kids    There's a lot to look forward to and enjoy about being an adult  but to really appreciate it you have to let go and accept that life isn't going to stay the same  It's always evolving and changing  and that's okay This is a problem that time will solve  In the meantime  two pieces of advice    Take it like a man  That is  take it in stride  don't let anyone see it bother you  Nothing will confirm people's  erroneous  lightweight assessment of you faster than you appearing to whine about it     Dress a little above your age station  It's a cheat  but it really does help people see on the outside the way you feel on the inside  like a grown up deserving of respect  I've experimented with the generic shit  But it always goes like this   Me  "Whats up "  Them  "Nothing much  what about you"  Me  "Not much  doing anything interesting "  Them  "Not really"  Dead end   And it sorta feels a little tense  Is there a way to break the ice   They're not specifically high quality designs that a business would buy  I think your main audience would be a fan of something that's looking for a specific picture  I know a guy who's in to furry shit and paid for someone to draw his furry and make a illustrated background out of it  I could see someone making a bit of money with this but very rarely get a request I am not black  I am half Caucasian half Hispanic It really does     And I'm sorry you are going through this  Mental illness is a terrible burden  But the fact is that you are strong enough to overcome it  I know you are    And at worst  if you truly can't take anymore just run away instead of killing yourself  Like quit your jobs  take whatever meagre savings you have and go explore the rest of the world   Nope Your not a bad person or anything like that  Everyone does that stuff  Though I suggest that if you can stop yourself then stop  Porn is not healthy for your mind  It is one of things I regret getting into and don't know how to stop doing Personally  the state of mind and behavior dictates whether you are viewed as a man or boy  age plays a small roleI still think it could be a good step to take  it's made me a lot more comfortable around women in generalStill ethnic  My point is to show that there are other reasons other than HIV cancer  So you're not trying to look better to appeal to girls Well I'm most definitely nearing rock bottom give or take a few weeks  I try to stay afloat but the world won't let me  There are always ways to take me out of my mess  But I will prevail  I refuse to give up If you live in the US you could be a protected class since you just had a child   Do some research and talk to an employment attorney Thanks for your comment  you made me see this in a way I didn't think about before    True  I guess I just need to find that audience  I'm not looking to turn photo manip into a career Maybe some other kind of art God willing    but for right now I'm just trying to figure out how to make some side money here and there   Recently I figured out that I being the jack of all trades is catching up to me  Photo manipulation is the only thing I feel proficient enough to try doing   I can work with computers to some extent  but I don't know where I would work doing things like troubleshooting  virus removal  desktop repair   etc  Those things are also easy to do     Thanks  you make a good point and it'll me helpful as I make my final decision So  why not try actually reading books  Literature  non fiction  whatever  OP  it's perfectly ok to cut off contact with your toxic family  Sometimes it's necessary for your own personal health and wellbeing Many people create throw away accounts so that they can delete the account after their problems or what they wanna ask is solved I've never really enjoyed books  But the whole point is  I just don't wanna spend time alone  I'd love to spend it with other people and socialize with them  I was in my room for like last 4 years  without going out anywhere  It feels like my life lost sense  I spent time alone for too long    If it comes to reading  I love reading  r nosleep from time to time  though  Troubleshooting is easy and probably very easy to get work in at home but in order to get people you'll need to share business cards in mailboxes etc which is an illegal business so you'll have to set one up which is not the most ideal when you're just looking for a bit of money  You could just tell friends and family but probably wont have a lot of people coming to you then I don't know  I've had male friends  who are aware I like them  literally cry to me about how lonely they are  while also laughing off or outright ignoring my attempts at flirtation  Some of us are simply too unattractive to 'count' There isn't really a creative solution  This is really all about setting boundaries with the people in your house  For people who work at home  it is absolutely critical to make very clear rules around how to behave when you are working    Edit  Have a little more time to type now  Obviously  you have to do the best you can within the limits of your home to carve out some "office space " I have to admit  I'm a bit incredulous that you have an 8000 sq ft home  but can't find a lockable door  Can you GET a lockable door    Good luck People tend to really think about gifts they give for a married couple   definitely send out those thank you notes  I can't imagine anyone taking issue with them coming later  Shut it down and refuse to talk about your other friend   He doesn't want to talk to her so be a proper wing man and stop her crazy train at the station  I like your no nonsense approach son  you are hired  It's not just about marriage  it's about being happy and satisfied in a relationship   It's about looking forward to seeing your SO smile when you look at them and wanting to hug them when they walk in the door  Some of the people I alluded to are getting divorced because they didn't think they could have that BEFORE they got married  Way more of my friends never got married in the first place because of the same  Check on him to make sure he's breathing every now and thenIt could just be her personality and her text ettiquette that she talks with emojis My granddaughter got married a year ago and told us that sending thank you notes is not done any more  Unbelievable   I think you label yourself as a "virgin" which kinda hypes up sex to be this unattainable mysterious activity you know nothing about  It's making you put pressure on the act that just isn't necessary  Take some pressure off yourself   plenty of people are virgins into their twenties  Instead focus on what you've stated you want   a romantic relationship  Don't let ur virginity be the focus of your pursuit of romance or sex   I promise it doesn't matter to anyone as much as it matters to you  as long as you're eventually a willing and gracious lover  I've made some money on upwork  Better than fiverr in my opinion I'm not victim blaming   All I'm saying is stand up for yourself  Don't let men boys anyone think it's ok to behave this way  Why do they behave this way  Because people are weak or too scared to hurt their feelings  Your body is one of the only things you have control over  Guard that shit with your life and don't worry about hurting someone's feelings      So  you're going to get blackmailed over  10     Are you guys in the 7th grade I don't understand why you got down voted  It's honestly fact  If people down vote for facts  what the fuck kind of times are we living in  Now for what he drives  doesn't matter  What does matter is toxic people  If your family wants to be like this  OP  you absolutely do not need to live or deal with it  Take solace in the fact you are getting into your own life and can do things on your own without government assistance  I started cutting toxic people out of my life half a year ago and right now  I'm feeling as good as I can  I'll be going to college  found a good job that'll help support myself through college  and feel like I'm finally fixing my own life  Anyone else who had a complaint about it  I don't speak to or even acknowledge anymore  including family  Your opinions and choices should only matter to you  No one else  Are they coed floors  It sounds like you'd be in danger of getting busted by the RAs  Also  what if one or both couples break up sometime in the middle of the year  All four of you would be fucked  Why not just stay living like you are and have sleepover dates a few times a week Just wait until they have to pay it back  I maxed out my loans in grad school so I could pay for my apartment and other stuff  Big regret  You've given me hope for humanity  Thank you   I hope you had a happy holidays  a good day today  and that tomorrow is even better   Try to ignore them  the trolls feed on negative attention  I like to think that There's more nice people here  than ones who have nothing better to do than make others miserable   No problem  Don't be afraid to go back out there and mingle whenever you're ready  If you think about it you were good enough to find a boyfriend for 9 months while in a bad place  so finding one in a better place would only mean a better catch no    Everyone except a few lucky few go through tons of suitors before finding the one that's right for them  It's a long and arduous process  never end up with someone you feel like you settled for  You deserve what you want in love and should reach for it   Ok  positivity aside go gettem tiger Oh geez  you said HIGH school    Um  Just pay him the  10     but how would we get busted by the RAs  Right  DON'T  ghost  http   www urbandictionary com define php term ghosting  this girl  That's very rude  and  it will undermine your efforts to get to her friends They're given grants  free money they'll never have to pay back  They get schooling free and then extra into their pockets This is the difference between someone who's good at talking with people and someone that isn't   If they ask what about you  give them a few lines of something  For example 'not much  just been watching  insert show  and probably going to be doing  insert activity  later ' then a few lines about whatever you mentioned   For example I cook a lot and make food  so usually that gets a response along the lines of 'oh cool I love  insert food ' so that leads you on to talking about food more etc   This is called leading a conversation  it's also something sales people do to get people feeling like they can trust them   You may feel like you are saying more but in reality you are just giving them more options to respond to conversation   In time they become more comfortable and they respond similarly  It's because we learn nothing from our history  People lose interest in it when it's taught in school  For shame  I'm gonna reverse this a bit and ask you for about this    Are online degrees more less work than not online degrees   Do they hold as much employability value as not online degrees   Is it more demanding as there's not a teacher who can speak to you in person about your progress   As for "actually useful" online degrees  I'd of thought that most universities offer them online too  I know they do here in UK and your final degree certificate actually says it came from that university and I don't think it says it's an online degreeBecause if people are living where they aren't supposed to live  someone will notice  I agree Abso fucking lutely not Haha  welcome to life  I'm 30 years old  I've been with my wife for over 5 years  We have a kid together  We both are very successful in our careers and afford a life that's so nice that we never really have to worry about money  I'm truly happy in every aspect of my life   And yet I still think back to this girl I had a thing for when I was 17  We were not compatible  I know this now  We tried and tried  but found ways to bicker and fight at every turn  We still had a strong connection  but it was like pushing two opposite sides of a magnet together  No matter how much we pushed  we found ways to push away again  Looking back  I have no doubt in my mind that she is not in any way the right girl for me  I am completely and totally in love with my wife and happy with every choice that's led me to her   But yet I STILL find myself thinking about that girl from when I was 17  Or that friend I had around that time that we drifted apart from  Or the girl I lost my virginity to in college  Or the group of friends from college that I've grown apart from   I have no reason to look back and long for those days  but it doesn't stop me from thinking about them  I don't even care about a lot of them and wouldn't change anything if given the opportunity to  But I'll still think of them   It will never truly stop  You two were best friends  That person had a deep relationship with you and was a very important part of your life for a period of time  You'll never forget her completely  Give it more time and you'll think about her less and less  This is the same situation for those who face tough break ups  Over time you think about them less and less  You get more space between you and them and you forget a bit more about your interactions with that person  You get new people in your life who are more important  so you think about the past less and less  But you'll never completely stop   It's okay to think about her too  It's okay to have feelings  Maybe you feel sad about some things  regretful about others  Maybe you long for the happy times again  or you wonder if she possibly grew up and grew out of whatever habits made her be your ex best friend to begin with   Don't try to force yourself to stop thinking of her  Maybe you've been trying too hard to not think of her that you haven't given your brain enough time to process your feelings on her to the point that you can truly "get over" her   Beyond that  all you can do is what you've already done  delete her from social media and from your phone's contacts and just move on as much as you can   The one thing I'll leave with is closure  The fact that you still see her in the hallways is probably what keeps her in your mind so much  And I'm sure your brain is racing when you see her  and you always think "should I acknowledge her " but you don't want to appear weak  so you just let it go  Maybe you left off in some big fight  and you never got proper closure to your relationship with her   It  might  be that you need a little closure  It might make sense the next time you see her to ask her if she's got a minute and to sit down and talk  Just air everything out  but in a positive way  Don't focus on things you don't like about her  but just acknowledge that you two are headed in different directions  but you feel bad about just ignoring your old best friend   Maybe I'm wrong  You seem pretty clear that you're happy she's out of your life  so maybe she truly did just evolve into this terrible person that you utterly hate  In that case  there's not really much to be amicable about or any tension to break  You'll still hate her even if you sit down and have a heart to heart with her  so in that case maybe it's best to just keep ignoring and do your best to move on Jan 2nd  for me  close enoughYour submission has been removed for   No asking for money  favors  homework help  etc  Try  r Assistance   r care  or  r

medication I was prescribed the standard SSRI  fluoxetine  to try it out but it didn't seem to do much  We tried different doses for about two years but I just seemed to be getting worse so I asked to switch  They put me on citalopram which really really made a difference   I think sometimes it's a case of trial and error with what's going to work best for each patient   I came off a year ago because I felt I didn't need it anymore and I was fine for the whole year until now  Since it helped me previously I will probably ask to go back on that for a while  I've never heard of this cheek swab though  would be interesting to know how it works and the sleepover thing  is that likely to be caught  For my part  if you don t like the way they treat you  speak up and don t wait their approval  An other thing  for me it s important   a grown man take responsibility for his mistakes I doubt it  That would be a pretty miserable experience for me   Thank you  I think I'm just struggling to realise that just like any physical illness  it is okay to take medication to help me get well again and I shouldn't be ashamed you answered your own question  anonymity a potentially large audience is a dangerous combination for assholish behavior they're family so they're gonna want you to good just not better than them Heh he ain't perfect  the problem with family like his  is that you don't have proper family criteria to help you judge      He is doing alright just has to be careful with his criteria because he is lacking family roles     Maybe the car doubles as a chick magnet  the question is if that is the best bait for quality   I actually enjoyed reading it without any punctuation  lolYou earned it man  So what if it's not good on fuel economy  if you like it and you paid for it on your own you deserve to have what you like man  Good on you and keep doing what you're doing  never listen to their criticism because it comes from nowhere that's credible  If it means anything man I'm proud of you for being able to do all this on your own and also doing it with the negative reinforcement from your family  Keep going strong man It would be nice if there were more science of some kind involved in deciding which medication is most suited to a person rather than trial and error Are you allowed to have sleepovers   I feel like my husband doesn't understand how big of a deal this is and doesn't care   Have you told him  Even though he's your husband  he can't look inside your head Thank you  good luck to you too  Having been on medication before I'll say be wary that often you get worse before you get better   can be 6 8 weeks before they start to help so hang in there Personally I think the no job or school part is more important than having a good social life  Also  that's how many people meet friends too  I'm in my 20's as well and most of my friends are from school and work because of similar interests goals schedules etc    But I guess to answer your question    There are interest groups clubs that could work  I have used the "meet up" site before and I think it works well for that as well as doing fun  interesting stuff  Who's there to reunite with If you'd like someone online  I'm always here    sometimes it helps to talk anonymously too  I can't promise to have all the answers but I'll gladly be a listening ear Your submission

last thing you want to do at a job interview is come off some schmo who's just looking for a paycheck  The hiring manager will want a committed employee  because turnover  old employees quitting  new

of credentials and experience you have that will make you more valuable      I'm in college and my class is mainly 19 22 year olds but we got a 30 year old and they get on well with everyone and is actually more mature so age discrimination should not never be at the top of your worries   That's my input as for the other questions you've asked me  I wouldn't know as I'm in UK and we have as first name basis but just go with the flow   See what others are calling them  very true didn't think of it that way just They may not have any idea what else to say  I suggest you start educating them  "Actually  here's where you say  'Wow  I'm so impressed with your money management skills that you can afford that ' "   Yeah I've had that happen before where I become super aware of how shitty my life is and I can't stop thinking about it and I can't catch my breath I'll pay him the  10 in pennies I'm sorry if my comment here made almost no sense but to simplify it   Age is nothing and just do what the rest of the class do   At the end of the day  you're all he same students studying the same thing I know  I'm interested in this cheek swab to see what works best    even though citalopram worked for me  a psychiatrist I saw months later was horrified a GP had even prescribed it to me since I have an eating disorder too and had been underweight before   and in underweight patients it's known to cause cardiac arrest  It's made me a bit wary now  I do still trust doctors but it was scary to know if my weight had dropped too low I would have been in serious danger That was actually really niceHi thanks a lot for the reply  One more question please  Do you regret being an electrician  Imagine being phones around for things like quotes  but then not having getting the job would be annoying  Thanks again for your helpwell i mean its not like the college allows that Hell no Maybe you should look into why you drink  Therapy might help  Try not to drink until it's figured out  And there are safe ways to explore your fantasies safe words and consent are key I mean this in the least patronising way possible but well done  Keep at it  Telling the people that care about you how you feel helps them help you with recovery    I find depression emerges by putting up a front to the world and being unable to maintain that image    Just be honest with yourself and the people around you if that means divulging uncomfortable truths then so be it Primarily  be  gentle  with yourself and try not to feel shame if medication is what helps you  Also  if you are afraid of being dependent on medication think of it as a tool rather than a solution  Use it to get to a place where you are  able  to rely on other methods  exercise  diet  acupuncture  therapy etc     And also remember that it is   okay   to not feel okay  Give yourself the advice you would give a dear friend  and whatever method has worked for you in the past can work for you now but it doesn't have to be permanent    Don't get disparaged if you feel you have lost all of your progress   you are at a unique advantage because you are a   warrior   who has been through this before  If someone lost 30 lbs then gained back 5 you wouldn't look at them negatively  so think of those pounds as months  you worked hard to get months of happiness in your life  so don't let these few months make you feel that that progress was all for nothing     Lastly  give yourself permission to be sad  ask for help  have an off day  and take it one hour at a time    This dude killed a cat and a bunny whilst high on drugs and then basically didn't give a shit  She was right to break up with him and start avoiding him  He is no longer a factor  don't feel bad for the fucking animal killer  Get the girl  "There are people waiting to love and be loved " Fml   Why do you feel that everyone hates you  What are your interests  Wanting to hang out is a great first step  It's always the hardest  so kudos to you for taking that first step  it's good to be confident  no problem man  If you don't think it has anything to do with your appearance  sociability  or anything like that then the only thing I can advise with confidence is to ask someone what you're doing wrong    If you can't see it then someone else might be able to  It might be awkward or embarrassing so it's up to you if you actually want to but you can't really move forward if you're in the dark as to why you haven't had much luck in love  If you can stand it  maybe ask a close friend and ask an acquaintance so you have more than one perspective on the matter    Sorry I don't have much else to offer  wish you well on your journey to fix this     This part is actually terrible advice but came into my mind for some reason  If all else fails and you're honestly at the end of your rope  just try emulating the most popular people you know into a sort of frankenstien caricature of them but sarcastically so no one can really say you are copying them or mocking a singular person  Get drunk  become a hooligan  just be nice but rude with  again  a hint of sarcasm so it sounds like you're teasing people and not actually being rude  Focus less on girls and more on your rep to try and win over people  Eventually one of them has to be a girl and since you're a hooligan hopefully she will be too  Also known as "fake it till you make it"I looked at it  Looks good  I think I need to get better at what I do before going on their though  Thanks friend Did you ask her if she wants to go on a ate with you All trade jobs are very similar but they are also unique to themselves  There's not many jobs like them   I don't regret anything but the job just wasn't for me  If you are having doubts like this maybe consider asking about an apprenticeship or trial   The work isn't particularly strenuous but you can work long hours especially if you work on your own  It's down to you though    Quotes and stuff is something you need to do your homework on  Call around other electricians and get quotes so you have a rough idea then undercut slightly   It worked for me    The other side is a lot of tradesman are overworked so they often pick and choose jobs  I strongly recommend not doing this because word gets around fast and business plummets    Edit  just realised I never explained first first fix  it's a trade term for a new constructions base groundwork  So you would be responsible for setting everything up  It pays a lot but the downside is you are always outside pretty much and you never see a finished building I don't have friends  mostly because of social anxiety and a general inability to hold a conversation without making things awkward  So they aren't allowed  And you'd probably get caught  Your submission has been removed

hungry people think they're entitled to food I may be wrong but i think minoxidil only works on follicles that have already developed but for some reason stopped working   If that's not the case  maybe i should try it This is difficult to do if other people are interrupting as well  as it becomes the only way to get a word in  Sometimes this is healthy  you can have a floodgate of good ideas without 1 person rambling on   Maybe you could make a subtle physical gesture when you want to interrupt  so the other person knows you want to say something soon  but they can still finish You are going full SJW here  I understand your concerns but at this point it's getting over blown  I understand the words rape and murder triggered you but this could just be fantasy i would love to have someone harass me in this day of legal stuff   easy money  go see a lawyer I might  idk  They usually do them at 10 years right  Nobody bullled me per se  but i never really had any friends  Would be emberassing going there if im still need  still have no friends  and still am a kissless virgin  I think eighteen would be the earliest but  r legaladvice would be better suited for this If they're getting back  3k  a semester  they're taking out loans as well No  no friends    I have social anxiety and don't share any interests with normies  don't care about sports  traveling  partying  or drinking  which is all normies want to seem to talk about   At best I can ask them generic questions  but after 2 3 minutes it gets boring and the conversation ends   Also  just talking to people for a day doesn't make them your friends  At best  they just become acquaintances  Generally speaking  friends have common interests  and it's hard for me to find people that share my interests If it makes you feel better    He's 20 in real lifeIn my country education on English is really bad  My english was as good as my teachers in high school and I very rarely made a mistake in English exams  However by paying extra money and going to separate courses I got good education  My grammar and vocabulary is quite good now  I couldnt improve it lately but I have been playing every game in English  watching every movie in English with English subs and listening to audiobooks and all    Audiobooks arent a big deal but when I first read a book in English it was quite hard  That really helps  Also you could probably find native English speakers to play games with  When I have felt this it has been mostly guilt  You start to think about all the shit you have to do  it becomes especially bad on loading screens   Try to reserve time for gaming instead of falling back to it  trying to squeeze leisure activity hap haphazardly in a busy schedule leads to overthinking  Intentionally play games instead of as a 'default' action   I might also help to go through a routine to put aside your daily troubles before starting to play  Meditation  low dose alcohol  etc I did let her know that she can lean on me if she needs me in a text I sent later that night  but I also let her know that she doesn't have to come to me until she's ready  if ever  You're right  I was being selfish but it hurts and I do depend on her a lot   When we were talking about it she seemed really unemotional and unsympathetic  which I can only attribute to her trying to be strong with so much going on and so much emotion to deal with  but I can't help but be confused by it  Anyway you're right  and I'll try to just leave myself out of it until she's ready I've contacted the people who can give me my money back and they sent the information to the consulting department  Waiting for them to tell me I got it backI totally know that feeling  Especially with regards to getting married  and having kids  All my friends are getting engaged  married  having kids  Heck my dad even got remarried and just had a baby   Then I'm sitting here playing videogames  watching anime  trying to make ends meet living with 5 other people  It's rough but when I look back on the person I was 2 4 years ago  I realize how far I've made it   Sometimes I'm anxious for my life to move forward  but if you look back you realize it was never standing still to begin with I have a few friends  But please understand  people tend to form friendships with those of a similar level of attractiveness  For those of us who are really ugly  there are only so many equally ugly people you encounter with whom you have enough in common to sustain a friendship  I've reached out again and again to those with similar interests  values  tastes  hobbies  habits  education  etc   but most thin and average attractive people perceive associating with a very fat or very ugly person  I'm both  to lower their own social status Ask how her meal is or what she thinks of the restaurant  has she been there before  etc  that might lead to "what's your favorite restaurant " Or "what kind of food do you like" or "what part of town city do you hang out in " Which might lead to "are you from here  Where are you from  Hoe long have you lived here  What do you think of this area  Etc   Or ask about her day  It's a week day so ask how work was which can lead to "what do you do  Do you like it  How long have you been there  Did you go to school for that  Are you in school now  What are you studying majoring in minoring in classes you like professors you like etc  Limitless questions about work and school  Of course the common piece of advice is to ask a person about themselves but don't forget to talk about yourself too  As much as people enjoy talking about themselves they want to get to know you too    Especially on a date  Even if you don't care that much about a certain subject about her life  keep it going  You won't be stuck talking about it the whole date  I find it very awkward when someone blatantly says things related to not caring or not wanting to talk about something while I'm in the middle of something I clearly care about    Hope this helps     Source  I teach social skills You're not getting back what you lent out  Chalk it up to the experience I think it won't hurt to write a letter    so you could explain to her what's going on with you  I'd totally understand if I were your friend  really  because I know how it feels to be overwhelmed by mental problems  Maybe you should also consider telling her as well  instead of writing a letter  but only if you're more comfortable with it  But I'm a guy with mental problems  maybe that's a girls thing I don't understand very well     And totally give the present you bought  it means you cared enough for choosing it even with all the stuff you're dealing with at the moment   i am also an overthinker  i ve just turned 21   and i have been in literary in the same reality  in every fucking point  as you write about so i had to sign up to comment cause i really want to help   Firs thing is you have to believe you will get out of this   Dont hate yourself  You are ok  you just need to chill  Go on meditation course  find meditation center    meditate  This will turn overthinking off and get you in a better mind set   Fucking most important  second is nofap  try not to watch porn or masturbate  It changed my life  google it   Approaching girls is another thing  I used to begin by saying hi to strangers   then telling them compliments   and then after I did this like a hundert times I was able to hold a conversation get a number sometimes   just google some pickup challanges to get through approach anxiety  Go see a psychologist    write me a message if you want to we can talk we might have a lot in common  I wish you the best and do not forget everything is all right  Funny  I JUST posted something sharing the same type of sentiment    Here  https   www reddit com r offmychest comments 5lvejl lost in life    I hope we get it figured out man  It's rough  However  Have you though about changing companies  It sounds like  for you  it might just be a change of environment   Problem is that many of us here will never find someone Maybe it's more like  2k  but they are awarded grants like Cal Grant and merit grants  they haven't taken any loans outIt's just a phrase  Similar to TBH  To Be Honest   but it's sincere  I live and have grown up in a heavily populated city  I'm just tired of the traffic  the rude people  the lack of consideration these people have for others  It's all me me me  I genuinely despise small talk and pleasantries  I just want to be left alone and to my own devices   Give me cigs  booze and peace   quiet  All I need is internet and food  I'm good to go Thanks mate  I'm gonna be bit stressed   busy anyway as my support network  mum  bro  are on holiday in a few weeks for around 6 weeks   but I have made the appt on 23rd and will take it from there  I will move about 5 miles down the road to feed Mums lovely cat so not all bad  You can create your own dreams   How do I do this This one is easy  Just send random snaps to random people like I do of captions like "I'm not feeling well someone shoot me" then about 1 in 5 will reply   If you go this route  vary it up a bit  some funny snaps and some random ones but if she don't reply or asks not to get the snaps that are obviously to multiple people  then bail this idea  The next one would be to get to know them  do they play sports  Have hobbies  If they play an instrument  ask to see them play it on a snap  or you show them if you do   And the compliments work too like "oh wow you're Pretty imo"  Lastly if you get tried these and they're not interested  drop em   They're obviously boring af   Also  try streaking with them and don't send the blank screen streaks   Send each one with a different filter each day or something   TL DR  Snaps to multiple people  if this don't work  try next step   Next step is to get to know them and if this don't work  then just accept they got the personality of a scarecrow   This is why I consider myself to have extremely poor social skills    So essentially your saying that I should be more open about myself and at the same time lead the conversation   I'll try this out on someone and see how it goes  I'll keep you updated    Also  I really appreciate you taking time out of your day to help me work on myself Don't tell them anything if you don't want  Maybe if you need a ride to the doctor or something  People get all kinds of crazy stuff done to their bodies  no parent involvement needed   It's gibberish in the sense that it doesn't communicate anything to her  You are not telling her anything about yourself  You are not asking anything about herself    I think you're communicating feelings   By complimenting her shoes you're making her feel good and so she associates feeling good with you   Most people run on little more than animal instincts      Communicating about things like who you are or who she is at a higher level thought process than most people operate at   "People won't remember what you said to them but they'll remember how you made them feel "  As they saying goes  something like that    No  I'm not joking  I'm not trolling   Smarter people  I don't mean genius level here  just smarter  really overestimate the cognitive abilities of normal people   Smarter people assume "well normal people are like me just a little slower" but that's not how it is   The thought processes are completely different   Most people are cognitive misers  they "think" in terms of stereotypes and feelings and not in terms of ideas   Yes  it really is that bad I didn't go to mine  My life is pretty great and gotten way better than high school  I was kinda ugly back then but pretty good looking now so it would have been fun to feel better than people who thought they were better than me but it was too farComing out of left field here  but it would make an odd sort of sense if this was reverse psychology  Like "I'm a hypocritical piece of shit  do this" so that you do the opposite and lead a successful life  Almost certainly not the case but just a thought I had My issue is that they're going to be spending time and money training me  then I'll leave  and that's not good for them   Just send random people snaps  Do you mean to mutual friends or just complete randoms     Get to know them  This paragraph sounds really interesting  I'll try this out     Dont send a blank screen streak    send each one with a different filter   Do you mean send a snap of myself  Because as I mentioned in my OP i have pretty low self confidence   Thanks Well some men like me are just doomed to be alone for the rest of their life like I said I have like a 100  rejection rate  going on dates  having to take it slow  guessing if they like me or not  leading me on for nothing  fuck all that shit I had it with that stressful shit I basically give up with women at this point its too stressful  I still feel a huge hole in my heart from being rejected from the last women I try to get with  if I have to pay for sex and affection for the rest of my life so be it  I was her first client of the day so kissing her in the mouth wasn't nasty at all That's a very good point  We don't currently live together  so I don't have a lot of control over what snacks he buys  but I bet I could help him meal plan and shop so that he doesn't get hungry and order a pizza    He actually lives with a guy who is nice  but is very obese and constantly eats candy  literally there are grocery bags and sacks full of chocolate scattered around his apartment  and pushes my BF to eat junk food  So a lot of it will be up to my BF's self control    You're right  the last thing I want to do is drag him down  I wonder if maybe he doesn't fully realize "weightloss happens in the kitchen" and focuses on the working out  I know he wants to go back to being a pescetarian and maybe that will help  although I wonder if  knowing him  maybe doing keto would actually help more  haha    I've never struggled with my weight  unless you count being underweight because I forget to eat when stressed  so I don't feel like I know how best to help someone in that situation     Why not  I think it would be best to be blunt  Well maybe not that blunt but ya know "Hey friend  I haven't had much luck with girls lately  Any idea on what I've been doing wrong " or "Any idea on what I could do to change that "  I think more importantly is who to ask  I'd make sure to ask someone who  like me  had trouble with girls but found ways to overcome it or more average people  "So  I realize this is random  but I get the feeling you and I might make pretty good friends  Would you like to get some coffee or a drink with me sometime "I am not doing it with the expectation or goal for it to get rid of FA  I am doing it for self confidence I am looking for a very simple program that I use to help get more fit  A program that is geared towards beginners and assumes you have a gym membership would be ideal Cut them out of your life  Seriously  If they don't respect you in the slightest bit then forget them I will go a step further   they are super jealous that you have ambition and DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT    because of this  they will try to tear you down with everything they can so that you can be back like their lazy butts   this is one area you will have to stop caring if you want to not let it get to you     you keep doing you    I am not looking to get really big  I am just tired of being skinny and scrawny Oh I get why it's a bad idea no doubt  but I don't find it unusual that a young person would buy something like that    I wanted a lot of bad ideas when I was younger    I used minoxidil for 6 months and it did absolutely nothing except leave a residue on my face then cause flaking after it dried So far  it's the best thing I've done   Good mental health requires baby steps to get back to   Starting meds again is a good step   Identifying positive and negative habits and thinking how to implement eliminate them   I want to exercise for my health  but I'm just going to start by setting time to get outside and walk for at least a mile  Then transfer to couch to 5k  and so on   I started with thinking I'm gonna get fit  lose weight  and fix my depression   Now my goal is get exercise ingrained in my routine  find a diet that becomes a lifestyle change  get a morning routine  find a personal project and just work on it  I'm not going to accomplish a goal  I'm going to start habits that I can build upon to keep improving    r getdisciplined has been a good start for me No worries  I used to be where you are now  To you it might feel like your chatting pointless shit but being more open allows others to feel at ease so they can talk back easier  It doesn't always work online because sometimes people are just busy doing other things and don't have time to reply fully but just keep going as long as they reply back and you will eventually get somewhere  Um     Not really the type of thing I expect to find on  r health   I'm fine with content about marijuana  excepting that it's good content I completely understand that feeling   I have friends who didn't really have romantic relationships until a little later and I know that also did a number on their self esteem  But the thing that consistently ended up helping them was just kinda deciding to work on themselves and work on being happy with themselves  Low self esteem is something people can spot really quickly and is generally considered an unattractive trait    I'm certain you're a perfectly interesting and attractive young man   you certainly do seem like you have the ability towards introspection  which will help you a lot in a relationship  But you need to love yourself before you can ever ask someone else to love you   and you need to find a way to have that feeling of loving yourself not be built upon someone else loving you romantically    For some people  that requires therapy  for others  it's just a matter of finding an activity that gives them a self confidence boost  martial arts  sports  cooking  etc   But above all  it's the pursuit of loving yourself that'll matter the most  You might wanna try making new friends      The best thing to do is to try to have fun like party and make yourself happy  Then you won't be as jealous right Most people wouldn't care because most people send nudes  ESPECIALLY US GUYS  just nobody goes around telling people all about it  fyi I don't send nudes and haven't ever Well  they are also easier to put them all in your mouth as well  Talk to someone that works in social security What is your job title Partly but if they dont like it than whatever  and also because i want to improve my face in general so i can stop being called ugly and getting looks of disgust  Also  every dude i see around camous can grow facial hair  and  my friends always have to rub it in  I feel like a kid among men Say "I feel like you are excluding me from the game and I don't really know why  can you tell me what's going on " The internet is really great for information  Look up events happening in your town  See if there are meetup groups or make one yourself  How about a team sport  Any community centers nearby  they usually have a listing of activities that are happening too   What about on Facebook Okay thank you for the advice  I think I'll spend the next couple of days writing themAbsolutely     nbsp   High school was the time of my life  I loved and enjoyed every second of it       nbsp   You should go to yours  I can't wait to go to mine      sIs it that you don't like dancing yourself  or don't like that she does it  If it's you  it may be good to take a few lessons  either a class or some private instruction  Getting a feel for some basic footwork and rhythm can make your time somewhat more enjoyable  even if you're not on the dance floor for every song  Even a little bit of skill in this department goes over very with ladies  it's a good investment of your time to learn a little Tell your parents or school counselor you are depressed and need help  Seek professional help immediately  Brain chemical imbalances can cause you to feel these ways  Yes  there have been situations too but your coping mechanisms are not working well for you it seems  Get help Thanks   You are the one who should define what the meaning of your own success is  not somebody else    If you are happy  which it sounds like you are  don't worry about what they think  At the end of the day  it's your life and your the one who makes the decisions    Good job at being so successful at such a young age Thank you for that  I'm curious about the no fapping  how did that work for you     I've thought in the past about seeing a psychologist  I will go there  hopefully in a few weeks  Thank you very much for reading  have a great life Oh that's not true for us at least  People should send them out we just haven't for our reasons I stated  But I will probably take the week and send themWhat if he thinks i'm creepy and just turns me down  Its my local supermarket so shopping there would be super awkward   OK so I'm 19 and go to college on a HND  a degree level course  equivalent to second year degree but it's just in college   I've just been through this in another comment on another post but there's a 30 year old in my class of 19 22 year olds and they get on fine with everyone else   Obviously they're more mature but they still get on with everyone  As for if your work experience will help  um YES   Obviously if it's relevant like you won't get into a sport degree with computer programming experience but yes they do take that into account  make a huge point of it in your personal statement  Refer to the first comment about the BTEC but I got a DM in a BTEC certificate and that's worth 200 UCAS points for reference  The student finance  Yeah that could be an issue  you're probably better off checking out gov uk and all the info is on there   I don't know if it's for people your age but I believe it is  check anyways   The way the student loans work in this country is they pay your tuition and when you leave your degree and earn 22k or more   You pay back 9  of your wage to the government   anything that's left is wiped off when you turn 40  Good luck  "Just give it another shot "   nbsp   Sure  I guess I want to be reminded of how much of a creep I am Jesus Christ     And here I was thinking you were trying to give people Spotted Dicks Depends  but i'm sure it will make my facial structure look better That didn't sound right to me  so i googled Cal state grants    Holy crap  I should move  Hm I never considered this but maybe I will  Thanks  I am already going to a therapist  And after the holidays  if I continue like that  I might go to a doctor  So yeah  I am kind of getting help    You can see the pain on his face Guys who know how to dance are in very short supply  It's a valuable skill in appealing to girls  Girls love a guy who can dance well  Take lessons  learn a half dozen dance styles and they will be a great tools for socializing the rest of your life  This doesn't make me feel very comfortable about filing for the first time in 6 years due to similar circumstance Plus fathers and mothers take cues from their families and when that is lacking can be really awkward lol  Thank you for the advice  I really needed some insight  I'm going to try with the lists  there are a couple of girls in college which I like but I don't know them  I might try something there after coming back to school I actually am okay with normal dancing its just that i hate clubs and stuffhttps   www theguardian com science sifting the evidence 2016 jun 13 dont throw away your statins yet ldl cholesterol is still probably bad for you  Devil's advocate for my own postYesIt obviously isn't "just a fantasy" since OP is asking for help  If she knew what to do about  and if it was not a  problem to her  then she wouldn't be even posting   I mean seriously  it is the definition of stupid to assume that rape and murder fantasies are in any way healthy  It is literally the definition of lacking in common sense    I'm done with this thread  It doesn't take a SJW warrior to recognize rape and murder as essentially bad  And it is just plain stupid to claim that it something healthy to habitually "fantasize" about     stu·pid     ADJECTIVE     lacking intelligence or common sense I can understand why you would say this  And to women  I believe that "I am a virgin" is better than "I lost it to a prostitute" However  there comes a certain point and age where you begin to realize that meeting someone is an impossible task  When this happens the FA does no longer cares about what women might think of the morality of doing this because they know they will never get a SO anyway After the new years breakdown  I broke a bottle of beer all over myself hahahaWhy would he think it was creepy r keto Some good ideas thanks manThank you  Keto changed my life and I never plan on going back  I feel like a million dollars  Which is exactly why I suggested she try exploring her feelings in a playful  healthy way How did you learn this I am going to Side on the fact that role play and acting out sexual fantasy is not abnormal   It may just be about losing control and having some one be more dominating  You would probably enjoy a partner who is able to take on a more dominating role when you do decide to have sex    Does tat mean turning into a slave in a BDSM relationship  Not really  But that is also something you can chose to do   There is nothing wrong with BDSM if you have a partner that you can trust   Same as if you met your future husband or wife and you both shared similar sexual fantasies   You would act out on them when you felt like it   It's certainly not a replacement but it's nice to have in your back pocket  Then I would recommend starting a regular exercise regimen of brisk walking or running  Studies are showing that regular strenuous exercise like cardio is very helpful in improving your sense of well being and effectively treating depression  Again  it promotes the brain chemicals that help you feel better while the exercise promotes a healthy body and your confidence  It really does work   Most people will say meeting new girls  While that is true  if you jump from one obsession to another it will be painful and unhealthy  Trust me  I'm going through the same right now  I'm planning to meet up new girls  but before doing it  I actually want to cease all feelings I have for this girl  boost back my confidence and then go meet new girls  But this girl I mentioned is an important friend of mine  so I also want to salvage my friendship with her  But straightly meeting new girls doesn't sound like the best option  Like I said you will just jump from one obsession to another  you will keep carrying these negative feelings everytime you get rejected and it will only be more painful  Also  if you do this and actually have the luck of getting attached to one girl  you might get overattached and develop dependancy issues  I would say you need to calm down  meditation helps a lot   think about your fears and find an answer to them  Whenever you feel refreshed you might start looking for other girls  EDIT  Also  make sure you're really into her and it was not just the adrenaline tickling  I mean  you have met for about 3 months and only fell for her after you almost hooked up with her  Is your attraction purely sexual or do you truly love her  And I really mean love her  not just feel attracted to her  Take some time to think if it really is love  then you can procced with the above methodWhat good would that do when there are 10 FA male to 1 FA female I feel the same way  I'm also 26  People my age around me have multiple kids by now  I'm married but no kids  I also have a degree but I'm still trying to figure out what I want to do with it This explains a couple of toxic friendships ive had to reconsider recently  Of course you can  it just might be a little difficult to find a place that wants that  If it's a weekend day  you'll probably have a better shot  Look for places hiring part time  you might find a fit  Fantasies that involve rape and bodily harm are actually not uncommon    Source   https   en m wikipedia org wiki Rape fantasy   These fantasies generally have more to do with someone's desire for sexual control  or lack thereof  than actually getting hurt or hurting anyone else  As someone else mentioned  there are plenty of couples that consensually engage in these types of fantasies in a safe way  Sometimes the sexual activities engaged in are within the realm of BDSM  sometimes they're not    You didn't say definitively if your fantasies involve you being hurt or you hurting someone else  maybe both   but either way  I would explore why you think you may be having these interests  Does it turn you on to feel submissive or dominant sexually  What qualities turn you on in people you're attracted to  What do you fantasize about when you masturbate  You mentioned that when sober  you're more into romantic gestures like kissing and eye contact  which is totally normal and not generally considered a fetish  Do these two kinds of activities ever overlap in your fantasies   If you are worried that you will make a dangerous decision while drunk  choose not to drink before engaging in any sexual activity  and you could maybe ask a friend to watch out for you when you do drink in social situations  If you do ever decide to engage in any kind of role play  BDSM or other activities  you definitely don't want to impair your capacity for informed consent    Also  if you are genuinely worried you may hurt someone or yourself  please do get some help  Better to talk out concerning feelings with a therapist then to end up in a violent situation    EDIT  I also thought of the point that you said you are a virgin  While this does not make your sexual preferences or experiences invalid  you do tend to figure out what you prefer in real life vs what you prefer in fantasy as you become more experienced with sexual partners  For my own example  oral sex in fantasy  Yes please  Oral sex in real life  Nah  I'd rather do something else  You may find that you're more or less into kinky stuff with a partner than you might have thought  and that's okay  provided everything is communicated and consensual   Good luck  I hope this helps Being 22 and still in college you should be surrounded by potential friends  Just start talking to everyone  ask them questions about things they like to do and when you find people who have similar interests invite them to do something  As a senior you probably are in classes with people you have seen before as your majors should be the same  which gives you an easy way to approach as you could talk about previous classes  teachers  etc   Don't be afraid to initiate  If you wait for people to come to you it probably won't happen  Try to make plans with someone or a group of people whenever you are free  weekends worked for me     By the end of the semester you could have a couple people you could consider friends  but you will need to work harder to grow the friendship if you or they move away after school   Don't think so  Think she's all set  I was thinking like something to do with wine or something like that not direYeah  the loneliness is awful  Humans don't handle it too well  even those like myself who generally prefer solitude  At least we have the magic of the internet to help a little with that now  so I'd be glad to stay in touch if you like  Either on here or through something more immediate like Discord or Skype  Certainly not the same as having a friend to talk to in person  but I thought I'd at least offer   Anyway  is there anything you're able to find some enjoyment in lately  Even a little Showoff  Sure  they often look for weekend people  Why do you only want to work one day  Well  i don't know  i'm just afraid of getting rejected    But thank you for the advice  i'm gonna try and talk to him tomorrowAs I been through numerous high schools i n numerous locations  my first was known for the sexual relationships between teachers  approximately 6 times did it happen  4 male students and 2 female students  The school was eventually nicknamed "horndog high"  Just tell her how you feel  Be honest and then move on  Simple as that Personally I like online classes better than in seat as I'm more of an introvert  I've found the difficulty workload to be about the same  however  the grading seems to be easier with online classes  A reason for this may be that often a high percentage of the in seat grade goes towards discussion  Therefore  discussion grades are often skewed upwards for extroverts  As for your other questions  your guess is as good as mine Just to a group of people who you wanna make convo with potentially  including this girl   Yes try out that paragraph and if it don't work or you feel they're not interested  drop them and just accept it  YES SEND A SNAP OF YOURSELF   That's like one of the fundamentals of getting to know someone on Snapchat  by sending them snaps OF YOUR FACE like the app is intended for   Start off with them half face snaps then progress to full face snaps        Alternatively  mimick them   They send full face snap  you do the same  they send black screen  you do the same   If you want help with the low self confidence  go to  r rateme   Them people are not brutal savage in any way and just explain your situation then follow the rules   They're constructive in their criticism  EDIT  Please ignore the bot that's replied to this comment smhSame boat here  As time goes on  our expectations rise and the new games with the updated everything is our new comparative  I still enjoy them for what they are and have all my old consoles games but now I'm working full time  going to school part time  and trying to have a life outside of that so gaming is almost non existent  That's more sad than anything because I'm still a gamer at heart There might have been something wrong with her at that time but I highly doubt you could suspect she is cheating just going by the odd answers she gave to you  So  yeah you are being paranoid  You should ask her about it though  Restaurants and other food service may be open to this  particularly if you can do Friday or Saturday   Mass market retail is trickier  as many of them try to do this "demand based scheduling" thing  and give people with seniority preference  Try to talk to an actual employee at a store you're interested in working at  Ask them specifically about what you're trying to do  and see if they think it is realistic  HR at these mega corporations will tell you whatever they think you want to hear to get hired  but they will have no influence on your scheduling once you're onboard r keto might be for you  Well good luck anyway man True  but it's what you might call a "strategic investment"  New York City seems to be exactly what you're looking for  It's a really dynamic city where you can pretty much find any sort of night or day out that you can imagine  Plus  tons of culture  If you want beaches or anything  I absolutely love San Diego   Miami is definitely beautiful as well  but SD is far more laid back  and the Mexican food is incredible to boot   PM me if you want any specific suggestions  It opens your mind to thought something governments don't want because   Removed   Reason  Threatens  harasses  or bullies So it's sounding like you should just take the time off from school   Staying at uni for another semester sounds like it'd put more pressure on you than you can handle  and you know what you want to do with the extra time  so I'd say you should go for it So just hard work pays off You can do this   I recently started up on medication again  and was having similar feelings of powerlessness and fear  I have been on and off various forms of meds from age 13  and I'm 28 now    These last few years I was doing everything right on the outside  but I couldn't shake my depression  I've been on these new meds for about 4 months  and I still don't want to get my hopes up too high  but they seem to be helping  If your doctor does recommend medication  I've found that asking a lot of questions about other folks' experience with it and getting a complete understanding of what to expect during the beginning helps ease any anxiety    I wish you the best   3I know you're right  I'm aware of the pain abuse can cause  even years down the road without anything even provoking a breakdown  It makes me feel great knowing I intervened before any actual assaults occured  and that it was just photos I caught  The kid has no idea anything untoward happened  and had I not stepped in when I did I'm not sure that statement would be true anymore    I only wish that would be my legacy  not the one I left instead    Woulda  coulda shoulda huh    I guess I can only learn and apply my lessons to whatever family will still have me  Less than ideal  but beggars can't be choosers  Thanks for sharing  I actually do enjoy reading these   I'm approaching 25  and after reading a couple of these positive posts  I've decided that if I'm still a virgin by my 25th birthday  I'll be seeking out to lose it to a prostitute   Thanks for sharing  I actually do enjoy reading these   I'm approaching 25  and after reading a couple of these positive posts  I've decided that if I'm still a virgin by my 25th birthday  I'll be seeking out to lose it to a prostitute   Hasn't anyone read 50 Shades of Grey on this thread Hello  AudiGuy3  Thanks for your comment   When the light in the bathroom went on so did a heavy duty fan  so it muffled the flushing sound quite well  when the door was closed   I have serious doubts that any of these fellow guests woke up as early as you  honestly  I don't think anyone got up before 7 a m   As for the toiletries  there was a separate metal shelving unit with lovely signs written by the hostess stating "please feel free to use any of the items on these shelves " There were three shelves generously stocked with large size bottles of body wash  shampoo  conditioner  and an array of other things like cotton swabs  vitamins  floss  etc  My toiletries  since I was a longer term guest  were in a bath caddy provided by the hostess and stowed away in a totally different part of the bathroom Well  I go to school an hour away  I live in dorms  I go back to the city on the weekends to do social stuff  I wanted to work on Sunday just to bring in some money Being drunk isn't consent   no matter what you said   Which you obviously don't remember so for all you know  you could've told her no  If you can't remember what happened and were truly that out of it then there's no way you were in the right mind to comprehend the situation   People like this love to blame victims for their awful actions  This chick sounds like she needs to be in jail  I'm so sorry and I hope you can come out of this knowing what happened wasn't your fault AT ALL  Especially since your "best friend" did it  you obviously trusted her and she violated that because she admitted she wasn't drunk  yet you were Yeah you should've found a bird to hook up with at least an hour beforehand  Ask  for a phone or Skype interview Yes the doctor is telling the truth  Both of those medications are prescribed for depression and anxiety all the time Always nice to hear a success story  The details make me feel a bit ill though  I would like to have sex one day but I wouldn't want to go anywhere near a woman's vagina Just use the regular ones and pretend to be a normieYou can be friends with me hahah  Its normal to feel scared socially because of a negative experience you have had in school but eventually you will have a great life    I keep re evaluating what I consider to be friendship and try and remember not to confuse occasionally saying hello to people I recognise in passing as friendship  So at this point  none Tried  failed First of all  good for you  It sounds like you really pushed for a nice life and that's what you got  applause   Second of all  I've heard many psychologists say this  but when someone criticizes you they are really just projecting their own insecurities on you  When I keep this in mind it never brings me down when someone criticizes me and I think you should do the same  It sounds like your family members are wishing they had your life  don't let them make you feel inferior Well  you're asking general questions about them  what do you know about them specifically  Are they reading an interesting book  Playing a video game  Family life okay  Are they listening to this awesome new band who are playing a concert in town next week  hey do you want to go with me then   But consider this  the people you are talking to aren't giving you much to go on  If they aren't telling you information  then their interest in you might not be very high That's assuming 100  are attracted to you in the first place  which isn't anywhere near the truth  Texting is hard because people are usually doing something else and you usually don't know what that is  Text conversations may die simply because the other person is busy   Instead of saying "sounds good" when they respond  ask them a question about work or school  or whatever they said they had been doing   Do they like it  what have they been working on  etc  If you just tell them what you are doing they may just think "sounds good" and don't bother because you already said that   You could try changing the topic too  Sometimes I text people and ask their opinion on things  people will usually respond to that  So I may ask about music  books  tv shows or anything else  That is another way to keep the conversation on them   Good luck Yeah  I know the feeling    I'm 27  and I have had a crush on the same guy a long time   We was blunt and honest  he had no intention of ever settling down or getting married  I told myself if I spent some time with him I'd get him out of my system and move on     We've had sex several times   I fell harder   He never once tricked or duped me   He was honest with his feelings on the matter   And I cut it off after this Christmas when I realized I wasn't happy and couldn't be happy here     I've got a great job  a great apartment  and money saved    but God I don't have one single person   My "friends" I recently over heard laughing at my social awkwardness   My crush that I talk with daily  we talk through a lot of his emotional problems  won't answer me when I want to try to talk through mine with someone   My parents are nice and all  but I can heat the silent judgement when I talk with them about emotional stuff     I live hours from anyone I know from back in the day   I'm alone and starting to feel nothing     I'm on the fast track to success with my job   And every single guy I've tried to date has commented that something must be wrong with me if I'm still single at 27     There's got to be something wrong with me because there's just no one   Everyone is gone  and I'm the only common factor   And I don't know what I'm doing to drive people away     I see all my old friends with babies  houses  and happy husbands   And I'm trying to decide what size pizza is too big for just me   The best revenge is living well  I think you should feel happy about what you have done with your life  but reading through this I felt like maybe you should be a bit more gentle on your family     I guess this is "off your chest" however so fair enough on second thoughts   perhaps this is exactly where you should come to talk about it so you dont have to lay into them in personhttps   youtu be Dfe0FQPMWzU        Starting My 2017 FITNESS Journey      5 01     http   youtu be Dfe0FQPMWzU     I trained my mind and mastered nutrition in 2016  NOW it's time to master fitness  Follow me on my journey to a very successful 2017        Michelle  Jackson   https   www youtube com channel UCTeW4KHXi89JjJTnwHQ6J5Q   in  Comedy     1  views  since  Jan  2017     bot  info   r youtubefactsbot wiki index I can understand this person  When I talk online or texted in the past  I didn't really have much to say  Even in person  When I answered yes or gave short responses  it was just because I did not have much to say  Sometimes I was hoping the conversation would change subject or that a more engaging conversation would pop up  I did ask that question  and in not so many words it was a no     If you cared for people then you would care for what they have to say   Not necessarily everything you could possibly try to talk about  And if it's just a matter of finding the right questions to ask  I can certainly see there being a massive disconnect between what you feel for any given person and being interested and engaged in a conversation with them   And  from the other side of things  you can care about the subject without caring all that much about the person who you're talking to it about    there is nobody you care for     No actual friends  You can get the same idea across a lot more positively by   asking   instead of   saying    what you don't know to be true   God  i am really sorry  I hope things are better for you now  They may want to be a part of your life now  but I would be wary  Abusers are abusers and will move on to their grandchildren if given the chance  Good luck and stay safe Bye fantasy police  You fail to realize that the person is probably ashamed of this fantasy and that's why they are asking for help  Exploring their own reasoning and emotions is what they need  You have no reason to be so alarmed It was a mistake to start or to wait so long Honestly  compared to most of the interactions you get working at these places  it may well seem genuine and refreshing  He probably gets a whole lot of "where is the baking soda " or "can you reach this for me " and a few doses of the "why are you still out of       I've been waiting for weeks  can you check in the back "  There are some creepy  and I mean  creepy  people who come through these places  People who are stealing things  or on drugs and don't have anything better to do  or  who knows  just plain creepy  If you act pretty normal  say you've seen him a few times and wanted to hang out a little  then you're probably good   That being said  you might want to write out your number and name on a little piece of paper for him  Some of these stores are not okay with employees having their phones out  or even having them in their pockets  With the note  it's a quick interaction if he's super busy or the supervisor is nearby Well since the photo has been spread around the internet already  surely you wouldn't mind sharing it  would you Do you think you could be friends with her if she rejected you This is the best advice and exactly what I would have said     Yeah  I'm thinking of a club where you say you're thinking of joining  and they let you walk around and see the facilities  Could be a gym or a yacht club or even a Costco  But don't use the equipment  Don't try to moor your boat  don't go to check out  because you're not a member  You're just visiting She might "know" you have a crush on her  but she only knows when you are around   She really doesn't give a shit about you  so that when you're not around  you are totally out of her mind  like pretty much forgotten Ack  so some of this will definately be some control and desire to stop from enjoying junkfood on your boyfriends part  There are some things you guys can do together  they are also fun   That may help  Heck  could also improve the roomies diet   Grocery shopping dates  Going out and shopping for food together can push you both to work together and make better food choices   I  can recommend going for fresh foods  but go for smaller trips to make you more aware of what you are buying and what needs to get eaten    The other half of that is then cooking together  It's fun to pick out all the ingredients for a meal and then make it together   Learning and discussing this stuff together  It is kinda a boon for you to not quite know how to help  as it leaves it as an area you can both explore together  Find books and articles to share  fun healthy recipes  strange advice you saw on facebook   Maybe take a couple classes together cooking  or different get fit activities that you maybe wouldn't think of that he could end up loving   Course  that's the "together" stuff  All of it is a gateway to encourage his own changes  and provides a fun and explorative way to do so   I also encourage not to worry about weight but fitness  I have met rotund fellows who could still run 2 miles straight   Guys often skip the kitchen part and focus on working out  which can negativily impact weightloss  Does he happen to have a crock pot  There are a lot of easy  pre prep meals you can freeze and then throw in to make for no effort meals   Also  making your own freezer foods to reheat and avoid pizza  Thank you   She is going to counseling for depression and alcoholism  I go to therapy for my own depression and anxiety   My boyfriend helps me through everything  He is really a blessing  Full time worker from home here  I have a fiance that works 3 days a week and is home the other 4  It took a lot of work living with her for 4 years to get her used to me working during the day and knowing when to interrupt me and when not to  These days  she'll usually ask me when I will have free time to talk about something and waits until I'm done  One good tip is investing in noise cancelling headphones and putting on non vocal music  I find it helps me work and she usually understands if I don't answer because I can't hear her  though she'll tap me on the shoulder if it's important   Cant post to r rateme because im under 18    and I also look really young  so that would be a dead giveaway 1 friend who's married I haven't talked to in monthsSo  I think you need to get out  If you already have friends and they are active socially  then go be active socially with them  If your problem is that you don't really have much active social stuff in your life  then you need to make some opportunities to do that  The best way to do that is meet new people  and the EASIEST way to do that is through SOME kind of activity    The easiest way to find an activity is to pick something  ANYTHING you can think of that might interest you that doesn't involve looking at a computer screen  If you can't think of a single thing  then perhaps your best bet is to try just anything   Try looking on meetup com for meetups near you  Try googling for "social clubs" near you  If you're in a university  try looking at a register of clubs or something  and choose one or two to attend   Someone said about writing  "If you want to write  the most important thing you can do is WRITE " Same goes for getting out there socially  You just have to DO it   Good luck man  Thanks    I'm less paranoid now  Really   What do you need self confidence for   Honestly  I don't know if you should expect to feel much more confident  I feel like most of the time  confidence is pretty immune to change because of accomplishment  I know it shouldn't be  but low confidence is surprisingly persistent It's totally fine to have never had a girlfriend  but focus on the actual friendships  Join some meet ups  volunteering  work  school  clubs  teams  gym  etc  to meet some new people and then make an effort to make some new friends  Thanks for the recommendation  It's helpful for me and I will keep that in mind  It really means something for me    I don't want to sound like rude or a anything like  I apologize if I sound like one  I really do    but would those things help me so I am not lonely anymore  Don't overthink the "really funny" line  You're not too closely related  if you want it  go for it  If you haven't run into her for 18 years at least  then it shouldn't be too awkward  If you were close enough to show up at family reunions or weddings  then maybe  but it doesn't sound like that's the case Then why did they text me at all  THEY are the ones who always text first "you know what  never mind  take care"Is there nowhere to work where you go to school thanks for the compliment  with practice I have no doubt that you will   I'm sorry   it's so hardUse this time to either save some money up with your job or do stuff that will compliment your degree and make you more employable in case you find your degree getting you not very many placesTry to work on your own perception of yourself  First you must like you  and then other people can like you too   If you're not a talker  you can be a listener  Ask lots of questions   You can do things that will make you not boring  Learn to play a musical instrument  Learn how to draw  Learn a new language  Play a sport  Join the school play if there is one  Make a board gaming club at school  Learn parkour   Youtube videos are gold for learning things Oh Discord is a brilliant idea  I have an internet friend who's lonesome as we lost contact a while ago  Now with discord our group can talk together again and she seems to be doing better  That's cutting it pretty close  I'm not sure about where you live  but where I am  we need at last 50 hours of time behind the wheel before taking the test  and many people do not do so well if they have the bare minimum number of hours    Can I ask why you have taken so many lessons  and such little time driving with your family  I think the opposite approach is more typical  take a few lessons to learn some skills  and then gain the bulk of the hours practising with a parent  It is much less expensive this way  since you are only paying for gas  and not the instructor's time when you are simply practising and not learning new things   If you choose to take the test  take it slow  err on the side of caution  For example  if you're not sure it's safe to turn left  you won't get points taken off for waiting longer  but you will for going when it's unsafe or forgetting your turn signal      about 3 4 minutes which was a shaky drive    How so  Are you uncertain about rules of the road  or still figuring out handling the car XTREMITIES has experienced professionals at its disposals to carry out body piercing  eyelash extension  tattoo making  It is also renowned for body jewelry and permanent eyelash extension to accentuate your beauty  Tattoo eyebrows look very natural and are worth considering  The firm is offering attractive discounts on every service   Wait so long  Wet dreams were nearly an every night occcurance for me until I started  That meant getting up  cleaning  changing underwear PJs  underwear is a must   and then trying not to lay on the wet spot if I'd been laying on my stomach when it happened  I had sex often with an ex  noticed my wet dreams stopped  and decided to give jerkin it a try again   had tried before  but didn't enjoy it because I wasn't giving myself enough time   Voila  problem solved  minus the fact that I haven't been with someone in 7 years now I just told you you won't get big  It's not about whether you try or not  It's not even something to worry about  Getting big takes years and years and years of extreme dedication and discipline  But you can gain some healthy weight in a relatively short time if you just eat a lot and lift heavy  Nooo  because then that just reaffirms to them that they are correct and know more than you  thus they need to give you "advice"  orders  on everything Is it possible for him to go back  but have your family arrange for an attendant to live with him there   It's probably cheaper and will still allow your grandfather to stay on the island   Edit  grandfatherSometimes people like to check up on other people  Are they asking you to hang out often YW  OC  I'm here to talk to  if you like The whole hipster beard thing  You generally have to be good looking to get away with that  Girls prefer clean shaven on normal guys in my non existent experience Thanks  man  Really  thanks   Idk what to do anymore  I need to talk with someone  Clearly if your friend thought to pull a girl off you  you had to be pretty damn visibly incapacitated  There's no excuses here  This girl tried to rape you  At minimum  you need to call her out and end your friendship YW  OC  If she weren't drunk and you were  then legally  you were too unconscious to make a decision for yourself   Plus there's witnesses so you got a pretty strong case here Why don't you ask this in  r austin  or one of the subs related to the school   The people in here that are not in Austin wouldn't begin to have a clue what people at the school think      edit     when you post an actual question that is asking advice  and not just opinions  I can reinstate this Experience I would guess  He's right even though I don't have the experience myself bI'm not sure you are comprehending the chain of comments   The previous comments elude to 51  of women disliking virgins right off the bat   I'm saying that it still leaves 49  of women that are okay with dating a virgin   Looks are irrelevant for the current context  Were simply talking about virgin vs non virgin alone  Just the one stat Feel free to PM me  I'll help however I can Yeah  beats the customer service job I currently work at   Customer service   Tech support for one of the UKs biggest electrical retailers  The operative word being "starving"  I'd like to see you tell a nutritionally starving person that there's more to life than food  No  I don't because of social anxiety  awkwardness  and well  me  Generally  my conversations with people don't last long enough for a friendship to develop  If somehow  I do find someone that I get along with and consider to be a friend  it either ends in the two following scenarios  ghosting or gradual disengagement  I would ask if you could set up a time to see her  You could give her the presents in person and also explain that you're upset about not being able to come to the shower  If she's a good friend  she'll understand that your health has to be a priority for you She should of texted your advice instead of being an assholeIf it makes you feel better  i didn't get my 1st until i was like 25No way    I cringe just imagining it  Grades  My grades have went from decent to non existent over a few weeks after I realized I hadn't even hugged anyone in years  let alone had sex   So no Thank you  Unfortunately I've tried the high protein diets and I get sick   I am thinking about the IIFYM  I think that's rape I'm screamingIt gives context for exactly how concentrated it is  and now much of an industrial product it is  compared to say  salt   You don't understand this place very well  Have we ever tried not to have sex  Lel   Does our celibate change something  How could we know  We have nothing to compare to   And please  your introduction isn't well perceived here I'm nearly 25 only just getting proper hairs on my cheeks  I REALLY want a thick beard    but there's nothing than can help that wouldn't risk baldness or acne  sadly You have to learn for yourself that your family will always be like that and accept that fact they they are flawed and ignorant  Changing them requires a massive amount of stress which u have to build tolerant for  Like divorces its really okay to distance yourself from family and set a good example   I have work friends  and a couple internet friends  but the only person who I actually used to hang out with has barely talked to me in the past year    I'd hang out with my work friends  but they're all married with kids and I feel awkward asking any of them to do anything  and they never ask me  FWIW  OP's post history has an AMA in which they claim to be male  while in this thread and some of their sexual posts  they claim to be a woman Yes  but this man is obviously extremely attractive  The rules aren't the same for statistical outliers like this  For the average person  personality is very important in attraction and things can be done to compensate for below average looks in this regard  That doesn't mean that for some select people who are very attractive having a good personality isn't important TROOOOOOOOLL IN THE dUNGEOOOONWhy tho  Then get a new advisor  They should help you with the career side of things too if they care about their studentsThe woman I lost my V card to who was paid for was part Asian and damn was she fine  her body was perfectly proportioned   I am glad you decided to go down this route  so many on here really need to do this after a certain age threshold  I found because I paid more you will get a better quality woman and if you treat them right and are young and a virgin they will treat you really well  cynically for repeat business    At least if you have finally experienced sex so can now understand how it is both amazing and at the same time not this grand distance act that is reserved for the elite of society  Also with the virginity gone you can focus on improving yourself more That's all good and well  but when most interactions with people has me drawing a total blank in terms of conversational topics I'd be interested in  I have to think there's something more than this going on   Although I might be missing what control has to do with anything  Does not doing something I don't think I'll enjoy or will benefit me or anyone else have something to do with control   Kind of seems like everyone else is playing the same game  Everyone's all like "Talk about jobs  hobbies and past experiences" and I'm all like "But that's so boring  I want to understand how people think and reason and have more intellectual conversations"  this is dumb as fuck  One of my former friends  lost his virginity at 18 when his dad bought him two escorts at the same time     for his 18th birthday   Ever since then he has had one of the best love lives I've known of all my friends probably  several long term relationships  right now with a really cute girl for a long time now   He's russian btw  Ofc you don't go around telling this to women  but i don't think there is any "curse of doom"I would too  hell that's all I want really  just to feel like someone or something is attracted to me  Hey   You are totally right  The part ''Don't try to force yourself to stop thinking of her  Maybe you've been trying too hard to not think of her that you haven't given your brain enough time to process your feelings on her to the point that you can truly "get over" her '' is what I haven't been doing  I will still dislike her even if i have a heart to heart with her  But I am going to try to accept the fact that I still think about her   I too don't even care and wouldn't change anything if given the opportunity  But I am going to try and let it all in  Hope that that works out  It sounds like it will work because that's the only thing i haven't been doing    I am happy that you have come to some sort of closure  Thank you so much for your reacting  It really means a lot to me Oh ok sorry this is a bad recommendation but follow my other advice and you'll get on just fine   if they reject your friendship for your looks then that's just a clear sign that you should drop them ASAPOh god  I don't want to think in 10 years back on some of the crap I want right now  Lol Yeh     Since he doesn't know what 419

Hugs  You get off on those Gotcha  best to clarify these things before the police do  How can't you make friends   By assuming that people don't want to talk to you because you're boring   Alternatively  by contacting potential friends infrequently because they never initiate contact  and you're paranoid that you're pestering boring annoying them whenever you initiate  so they slowly fade away   Easy peasy  1 2 3   That said  I do have exactly 1 friend I met while playing World of Warcraft who managed to cut their way through my bullshit  and I really cherish that Please please do something about this  That dog counts on you and you only  Nope  that's not trueWhat  I included blow jobs since those don't count as sex  At least I don't count them  Are you claimed as a dependent on your parent's taxes   If so  what state are they resident's of   Since you've been in school and not living in Florida  I doubt it's "that easy "Get off on hugs  What the fuck are you even talking about Yes  you can outgrow people  It happens all throughout life  especially out of high school college big life events  I wouldn't dwell on it  If they come back around then that's great but if they don't   that's great too  Focus on you and if you want  go out and maybe try to meet new friends if you're comfortable  Sometimes life honestly just gets too busy   I had sex with an ex  Chad watcha doing hereExactly  Yes I'm very aware  My father when confessing his abuse to me also confessed he was abused by his grandfather and sister  We definitely have boundaries set  The struggle is my mom wanting to watch my daughter alone and not understanding why that's still a concern  Bc I can't trust my mom equally as much as I trust my dad  She can't understand why even though she didn't do what he did  she can't be trusted  Hence  the therapy  But thank you  I'm honestly doing very well  My life improved EXPONENTIALLY once I was no longer dependent on them whatsoever   I'm a big boy   For you  Avoiding making him upset is long gone  He is intrenched in the idea that he is helping someone  and that everything they're telling him is true  Someone  and soon  will have to confront him  Do your managers dislike you aswell It doesn't From https   www mccombs utexas edu BBA Admissions Transfer Students Your GPA is a tad low  but not impossibly so     You have good extra curricular

broccoli or chicken   Lol I'm not that good at trollin tho  For as much as it's worth I actually do this  But yeah maybe it's a bit ridiculousI don't think my guidance counselor will have a problem with me explaining the situation to her  She knows about my living condition and encourages me to talk about it  My dad is putting a lot of pressure on my brother to succeed  lucky he doesn't come by often  busy with work   Thank you for this advice I am going to try my best to talk to the guidance counselor when I feel brave enough     Christ  I'm 22 and not looking forward to this  I already feel like an abomination  others probably would think it too if they knew I was a 22 year old kissless virgin  because honestly it is pretty fucking wierd  Like  I can just imagine what people must think  like "what the hell  What's wrong with him"  By 30  you tell people you're a kissless virgin and they literally think you're a fucking mentally insane  unstable doll collector that lives in his moms basement or something  Well  you probably are  As in if they have 500 potential partners  you might be number 490 on the list  But of course they'll never be that desperate to go that far down  So if people 1 5 don't respond they'd rather wait it out until someone new enters the picture and date them instead Salt isn't concentrated any less I may sound dumb  but what is a hair transplant I'm just saying that whatever dating pool you have  being a virgin cuts it in half "You have the right to remain horny "  "Okay officer  can I call a lawyer though  A   female lawyer "Ultimately he can warp the truth to the story  say he met this girl on tinder etc and go into details of the actual act and leave it at that   At least he is starting to clock some mileage in the sex department regardless of how it was obtained and that is a great benefit to have especially as O P is nearing his 30s   Some women love the idea of virgins but many simply do not want to teach  many women love sex and want hot  passionate cum inducing sex not having to instruct someone the correct way to finger bang for example   Also it is safe to say this worker is probably cleaner than many skanks that frequent the likes of Tinder or clubs and so on  a high paid sex worker and any associated establishments rely on the pure sexual health of their workers if they want to maintain an income stream That's always what I find strange  Makes you wonder how many "losers" in real life are having sex  the answer being lots of them    We are like a seperate breed of losers  hell  alot of FAs aren't even "losers" per se  Guess we're just a different breed of disturbing abominations  Yeah  I'm friends with two guys who have about as much social success and romantic experience as me Second rule  bro  7 years without someone  gonna be a million fucking more because of crippling anxiety  and more   Only ever been with one girl  ever  and she wasn't a looker to anyone else What would a hug possibly be good for  They're the worst  People give em out for anything these days  WorthlessSurrounded by people on new years     r Absolutelynotme irlHave you forgotten what sub this is  We're all awkward wierdos  I kind of went thru something similar  but not exact  I worked at McDonalds when I started college thinking I wanted to be in Graphic Design  and after 2 years I decided to switch focus to Accounting  I really liked accounting until I transferred to Online University and nearly failed all my Accounting classes  I hated working in fast food so I did finish my Associates degree and now I work in an accounting department but I hate it lol  I'm 25 and still have no clue what I really want to do with my career  But the point is that I finished my degree which got me in the door to so many other opportunities  I could easily change the direction of my career if I chose to    I suggest thinking about what you like and what you're good at  Are there a lot of different fields you could go into once you have your degree  or is it mainly just one kind of job  If you have options then that's great    I would finish your degree  There are also so many jobs that would hire you just for having any degree  Yeah it is something to be proud of  My quip is that I feel like I'm missing out on a huge life experience by never having been in a relationship  I've never been in a relationship because I don't think I was ever comfortable with myself or emotionally mature enough  I used to think that being in a relationship was like a fairy tale where two people love each other unequivocally  probably because I loved watching romantic movies    There's things that I find attractive about women which makes me drawn to them  Because of this  I don't think I could ever not want a relationship with one Keto isn't high protein  It's just regular protein  Keto is a high fat  low carb diet  Most likely no  All the people who cast me out as a weirdo obviously will go on to have success in every area of life  Going to the reunion would just confirm what I already know  the pecking order still stands It took me a long time  too  I always felt like I had to power through it unless it was absolutely necessary to function  But eventually I managed to prioritize just having an easier life O everyone could see how much of a loser  ugly  failure I turned out to be  Fuck that  There's a reason we go to college with different people than from high school  and to be perfectly honest  most people in high school are thinking too much about themselves and their own drama to worry too much about those around them  For example     a boy next to me could see my pubic hair and was kind of looking at it  I tried to pull my skirt end down  didn't really help  He still probably thought I was gross  Honestly sounds like he was being a little bit of a creep and or normal teenage boy  He was probably looking at your panties and is embarrassed that he got caught  If he's looking back in his memory  more likely he's thinking about he was bored in class and saw up someone's skirt until they noticed and that fun went away  not "eew goldkione has pubic hair " Meanwhile  it sounds like you're a bit embarrassed that he was looking  and want too end that thought memory  One event  two different stories   It sounds like you are working on managing your emotions and actions  as far as stiming and such  That's good on you  The thing is  though  people do all kinds of silly and regrettable stuff in their school years  and even in college    Some of these people have conditions they are trying to cope with  and others are just dealing with the hormones and drama of growing up    One of my favourite speakers philosophers is Slavoj iek  this Slovenian social critic  I find his ideas interesting  but if you watch his speeches  you do notice he's got some quirks which are basically facial and arm "tics"  rubbing his nose  sniffing  etc    He's even got a talk where he speaks to his difficulty in controlling this  and how it upsets him  though he's learned to take it in stride  Why do I mention this  I suppose because he does some objectively "gross" things  but honestly  he's such an interesting speaker that nobody really cares  He gets invited all over the world to talk  Sometimes we've got what we've got  and have to accept it and work with it That's exactly the point  I went to the 5 year reuninon and had a good time and got stupidly drunk  we were so bad the school actually limited alcohol for the next years hahaha   The 10 year I didn't as I didn't get a formal invite  neither did a couple of others I knew and it ended up clashing so I didn't bother  if there is a 15 year I honestly don't know   Also with Facebook most people know each others shit anyway so it is sort of redundant for a reunion  Yes you can  it's called moving on    But always be there for them and if you need help  go to them like you would have before  if you would have Who is criticizing you  Phd's or your peers or your test subjects      And you picked the wrong election cycle to take this on    in a university  read very liberal  setting   Sorry   Academic freedom is an illusion   The best way to deal with criticism is its never about you    Its always about them     But you must temper this with the knowledge its their hoops to jump through so you must conform in your work    Your own beliefs you keep to yourself   Academics are far more political than they realize     It does make you desensitized  but I've found this has next to no baring on your ability to get it up  only last longer  So go for it m8  nofap is a memeNo  Celibacy does not improve cognitive functioning    If anything  it probably improves it  I see  I just really like my beef  I also love vegetables  Not really "forever" alone are you then  You should really check up the definition of forever This made me lol and I really appreciate your comment  Thank you My school never had one Because I haven't had physical contact with a human being in years We're just part of the background  not important characters I have friends I play board games with  A shared interest is helpful to making friends Deal with it  basically  Doing things you wouldn't normally do to change someone's opinion of you is probably not a good idea  I think most 20 year olds experience something similar   It's a problem because it takes me 10 weeks of knowing someone before I think I have a shot with her  Save yourself 10 weeks and just assume they're interested  You won't know for sure until you ask them out anyway I eat lots of beef and vegetables  Leafy greens as much as I want  moderate amounts of squash  onions  and peppers  You should look into it though  I feel amazing and never plan on going back  If you're not in work or education  you find friends through hobby groups Yep  I'm an expert at  not  having sex  Got that one down pretty good I've already done that  In the case of Death Note  I actually like the Hideki Taniuchi part of the OST much more than the Hirano half of it  and Taniuchi is also the composer behind Kaiji's OST   Never going to be able to hear from him again though considering he got locked up in  Japan  of all places for weed  The world is a cruel  cruel place   I think people would still find it pretty weird if I name dropped Japanese artists though  they'll just jump to the assumption i'm a weeb Stop time  eh  Makes me wonder like I already have 50 billion times what that must be like  I used to have IRL friends but none of them really talk to me anymore  sometimes once a month or something  I am lucky to have a few good friends online though  That keeps me going No  a few smoking buddies but that's it  It's probably a bit late to make friends with anyone college if you're almost finished  At that point  most people have settled into friend groups   You can still meet people by joining hobby groups  though  Preferably something outside of college so you can keep going once that's over I think you'll find it'll be a relief to be done and have "the monkey off your back"      Keep that in mind if they hit you up for a housewarming gift  yeah im a dependant and they are North carolina It takes time  It's a sign of being comfortable around someone   you can't force it  When I do it with my friends it's usually jokingly insulting or self deprecating  and you need to spend time with them for that to work  Partly because you need to know what you can joke about and what's a sensitive issue  and also because it just seems weird to insult someone you just met  even as a joke How old are you Sorry  that was poorly written  I meant that even though you might not be excited at the thought of dating any guys you know  you can still be straight  You just might not have met any compatible guys yet  That's not a bad idea  How do you like your apples They can come to your house  spam  steal your real mail  spam   Mostly harmless  If a govt ID or bankID was given you would have a lot of work todo NOW   No reason to change locks or move Never never do that  It will not accomplish anything  You will be blamed and suffer the rath of him and his wife  You are just as guilty as he is  Do not cause trouble  this world has enough trouble in it Food is a package deal  it's much more complex than just carbs fat protein   There are literally thousands of compounds within a piece of fruit that all interact in complex ways   That's why its impossible to find health in a pill and we most likely never will   Those phytonutrients interact to slow the absorption of sugar and provide additional health benefits on their own   That's why this "sugar" debate is ridiculous   Sugar is an isolated  concentrated extract that is man made   Similar to how if you isolate and take the oil from something  say an avocado   it is no longer a food in and of itself   you wouldn't binge on avocado oil   Similarly  you don't binge on "sugar"   What people are binging on sweets   Which is full of sugar  fat  preservatives etc etc It's possible   I was a bit late myself  I only started when I was 18 since my penis isn't very sensitive  That might be the case for him and if you're not constantly talking about gross shit around guys  you probably wouldn't realize that it's incredibly strange to not masturbate Unfortunately a lot of people are bad at conversation  If you want to talk to them and they're not giving you anything to work with  you'll need to put the extra effort in  Personally I find that if I'm doing that for every conversation with someone  it's probably better to just not talk to them anymore    Or  as someone else said  sometimes people are just busy and forget to respond  Practise empathy actively  To clarify  I'm not suggesting you lack empathy or you're not doing it already  but in my experience  thinking about empathy actively when interacting with others makes the other person feel good and cared for    What do I mean by empathy  When people share information with you  ask yourself why they're talking about it  what motivated them to do x instead of y in their stories  and take note of their tone and body language when they're speaking  This is where questions often come into play and they usually sound more natural and show that you're engaged when you approach it from a perspective of empathy rather than a script  which can sound contrived and insincere   But does it increase sports performance  Because I don't see much difference with me  But i heard from others it gives then better drive Hookers  Try em  They're hot What do you mean  Salt is literally just natural blocks of salt rock ground up   Well at least when it's sourced from mines  which are the types I tend to go for Exactly  that's why adding it to food spikes our blood pressure   It is in our diet in unnatural concentrations   Sugar that is extracted and refined is no longer food   Same with avocado oil or anything that is processed and refined   Food is a package deal   always The reason I don't want to do this is because this occurred after only the second time we've met  so we have no established friendship as of right now  She might be hurt by it enough to tell her friends that she and them shouldn't see me anymoreIgnore her  That's what she does to you  I know it's heavy handed  but I'd say to her to get over herself  She knows she's wanted and she just wants attention  Move on from her and flip the bird  She was never worth your time You might try posting this again using "self conscious" instead of self aware  My advice for you  Fake it 'til you make it pedofriends is shut down fyiLeave the kids out of it  Plenty of people are children of divorce and they turned out to be more than fine  It's 2016  no one needs to be "trapped" in a marriage  If they want to sleep with other people  if husband and sister in law are in love with each other than own it  The lying is the problem  THAT destroys children  Staying together and keep lying is just plain stupid  17 I made it to work and it is almost over   It started out like I could go back to sleep if I closed my eyes  while I was at work  and then I got anxiety so I had to take some medication   Things are starting to get blurry again  I need to refocus   Yesterday I did ok at my parents' house until my mom made some stupid comment but I tried to let it go   After we left though I got all tense and then tunnel vision happened and that made it hard to interact with people   My skin is doing horrible things   I don't understand it at all   I was washing it without soap for like 2 weeks  with just a moisturizer type cleaner  and it got dry and flakey  so I exfoliated with my acne stuff and used that for 2 days and now I have acne again   I'm afraid to use the CC cream I have to cover up because the last time I wore it I could feel breakouts happening   It's this weird feeling on my face where you can just feel the pimples coming out and it itches and hurts PLUS then my skin is covered in tiny pimples   I guess I could try it again though  I haven't worn it since November and I've got breakouts anyway  what's 50 more   Fuck   I like my phone  the selfie taker smoothes out my skin and makes it glowy   I want real skin like that r fitness has really good stuff for beginners  but i also feel like it's a bit overwhelming trying to sort through all the information on the wiki  and most questions asked by beginners are answered by "read the fucking wiki"     So I'd suggest checking out Stronglifts 5x5  it's the stereotypical beginner weightlifting program   If memory serves  it starts you off with bench press  overhead press  squats  deadlifts  and barbell rows of some sort   Do it for a little while  but also don't be afraid to add in different exercises sometimes  change the order around a little  play around with it and make it your own   Stronglifts also tells you to do squats  like  a lot   If you want to do less squats and focus more on upper body to start  that's totally OK   But also  don't totally neglect your legs   Good luck Be more assertive  You're likely acting subservient and acting like a doormat  People will always take advantage of these types because they can tell a person what to do without the recoil    If it bothers you  you need to prove to them that there are unpleasant ramifications that come with being a presumptuous asshole  Speak out  call them out on their BS  They'll stop  unless they're your boss    If they're nice people  then just kindly remind them that you know what you're doing and instruction is unnecessary      Know your craft and skill    If you're confident in what you're doing  then a great way to show this  is to speak out  If they say to do one thing  offer a better alternative  You'll stop appearing unknowledgeable  If there's a problem with something they're doing show them this  Worst case scenario  if they're policing you at work for their own sick sense of validation  then do the same thing back to them until they realise how shitty it makes them feel    Do not correct a fool  he will hate you  Correct a wise man  he will appreciate you    A wise man speaks because he has something to say  a fool speaks because he has to say something  I'm sorry that you experienced a similar situation  You're  right  him being dead will not help anything  I need to accept that I'll have to live with this and move on with my life    To be honest  I've known about what my father did for about 2 years and only now have I been getting really angry about it  Back then I didn't actually know that what he did was wrong  as I grew up in an extremely religious household and no one talked about anything like this    I wouldn't say I'm drowning in misery  it's more like I feel detached from everyone around me  Kind of like I'm in a box where I can see all around me but no one looks inside  But I put myself there  so I suppose I can step out      Give yourself time to process it  The wound is still fresh but time will allow it to heal  Good luck to you  I'm not 100  sure whether he did  but he'd normally check on me by now out of worry  I guess this time I creeped him out    And now I'm all teary eyed inside a fast food place  Thanks for talking to me though  ' Thank you     It's a real drag being an ugly man im telling you  especially when you realize it's a cruel joke in the bloodline  my father and i look alike and my cousin looks exactly like my father's brother  my uncle and my cousins are known for being the best looking members in the family  and all my life I have lived in the shadow of my cousin because due to how closely we interact  our dads taught us to call each other brothers since we were toddlers    So I get your feeling  I will be sure to pm you the link when I post in "am i ugly"  hopefully I will hear from you too   As the girlfriend of a guy that did this to her while he was drunk  multiple times btw   yeah she stayed  but the memories of this night will eat away at her eventually  No matter how long she hides it  it'll come up again  The resentment will build      Sugar is probably the worst evil out there   Whoa there with the hyperbole  Alcohol ruins far more lives  OxyContin does too  General lack of exercise Is huge  Trans fats are terrible    Sugar is bad  but calling it "the worst evil out there" is some bullshit    I agree with the other post  but be sure not to make it an interview  Why is the movie such a topic of conversation  It's a connection point  Listen for those as you get answers to your "interview questions " Oh she likes rock climbing  You tried that once but it didn't turn out so hot  Her favorite food is chili  Hey what do you know you love chili too  Use the basic points of connection to jump off and explore   Don't be afraid to be honest when she asks questions as well  people always appreciate sincerity   Also get into the why's behind the what's  Don't be afraid to ask  "why is that important " or "how did that happen " take time to listen to people and really try to understand what they are trying to say Im 23 and porn interferes with my relationship with my girlfriend every once in awhile   Ive seen my dad watch it   I caught my older brother watching it when i was a littler boy   I started masterbating st a reslly young age  I was never molested or anythin  but bc of that i also got into porn at an early age   Unless ur parents are a strict hardcore religious type i cant possible imagine how they would take it badly   Have u ever had the "TALK" with your parents Often it just means recognising when the other person is bored and dropping the topic  If all they're doing is nodding along and occasionally giving a simple "yeah" or "I know what you mean"  then you're probably boring them  Or look at their face  if it seems like they're trying to look at anything but you  they're probably looking for a way to end the conversation  It's fairly easy to see once you look out for it  I learned this from being in a similar position to you   I had a friend that would do this all the time  and that's how I realised I was doing it too   If you can tell you're boring someone  cut the story short and talk about something else   preferably about them  If they're interested in what you're saying they'll probably be asking questions and responding with more detailed comments  Oh  I meant like    Setting a timer and freaking out if they're like 1 minute late  But yeah  after more thinking I understand why even without an incident  you'd want to be careful You could put the back of the dresses up against the side of your bed so that when you're sleeping and turn to one side you will have a dresser back there  That'll save space  I did the same thing  Moved out  got a queen moved home and bad to compromise space  I just situated my room differentlyIn general  I guess  He dressed as the opposite sex outside of the home once  he is a transvestite   but I did not see or witness this I too found out at 18  Just remember  these are your parents regardless of biology  They love you and who cares about how you came into this world  What matters is who brought you up and who will continue to love you and guide u I plan on following your past advice  and I feel your right  if they will instantly judge me because of my looks  why should I even bother   Edit  I also want to say thanks for taking so much time on this socially inept stranger I know exactly what you mean  It reminds me of a careless and safe past   Look up  nostalgia   that's what you're feeling  Try one of these links  https   www google nl search q cope nostalgiaDon't agree  Sugar has ruined many more lives than alcohol I think you evidently know what the issue is  That's the first step  The second step is to get tested  You never know if you caught something  And finally  unless you're in a serious relationship where perhaps you've both been tested  use protection  Being "braindead" isn't an excuse that'll hold up if something serious arises   Well  he's to both being 20 and working through difficult times  Thank you for your words and kindness  really it means a lot  Thanks  I think I will  I don't want him to think this makes me love him any less No r femalefashionadviceThis conversation is about health  Bodybuilding isn't "healthy" in a medical sense If there is any legit help most people degrade or downvote anyone to the point where the simply don't bother any more    I don't think it's a valid excuse  I am just trying to describe what happens to people that want to talk about it  I did get tested and was clean   Again  Im not trying to validate my problem  Im admitting Im wrong  But I clearly can't trust myself to just do it  That's why Im here Real friendship is effortless   I don't have to struggle to find something to talk about  I don't worry that I'm being boring or wonder how I'm coming across  If it's a fake or forced friendship I'll feel slightly drained whenever I'm talking to them  and I don't feel I can be honest with them    It's rarely to do with those people being perfect all the time and everyone being polite and respectful  The best friendships have the sort of mutual respect where you're comfortable giving each other shit  and doing things that would usually be awkward  This might not be useful to you  but remember that you don't have to be part of every conversation  Sometimes you just gotta sit back and listen  or maybe ignore them and get on with your own thing  Congrats on your life man    live better than themHi  thanks for posting     that usually ends up with an akward silence since i have little to talk about    i have NO clue what to do  where to get together     First tip  Do things      MetaFilter user "mollymayhem" once gave this advice   "Don't just get coffee or drinks  that puts all the pressure on you guys to entertain each other  Do something that entertains you guys together  Cook together  go for a walk  go to an event or concert "  "Ease and comfort does tend to come with time  though "  She's right   When you hang out with someone  go do things   Even something simple   e g  just walking and talking through a shopping mall or down a busy street or in a store      Second tip  Ask what's new      When I talk or hang out with someone  early on  I'll ask something like   "So what's new with you since the last time we talked "  Then  whenever there's a lull in the conversation  I might ask   "What else is new with you "  This helps a lot   Or  if applicable  you could ask about their dog  or how their classes are going  or things like that      Third tip  Or you can discuss current events      As  u Sarquon mentioned   weather  news  holidays  etc   Spend five minutes reading the local or national news every so often  learn what's going on  and then this might give you conversation topics    Note that it might be wise to stay away from religion and politics   For example  if you're a Democrat  and the other person is a Republican  the other person might decide that they can't be friends with someone who supports Hillary Clinton      incompetent  self hating     i have a constant feeling that everyone hates me  Have you ever thought about going to a therapist or school guidance counselor to discuss these things   Maybe you're not truly incompetent  and maybe not everyone hates you  and maybe they can help you to see that this is true   Anyway  I don't hate you  so it's now proven that not everyone hates you        Note  I've edited this comment  to add more tips   0   I don't understand your OP   May I ask    Are you male  or are you female The best thing my mother taught me was "you do not have to love someone just because you are related to them "It's possible  but I don't know how to approach the subject  I can only imagine myself asking "Did you  um  receive my present   " and awkwardly waiting for a reply because I don't want to seem pushy   Another scenario I imagine is him being cold to me because I technically lied to him this whole time  and that is scary to think about I'd recommend dance lessons or drama  Plenty of women  Not to break the mood or anything but he might be trying to help now  however if je is looking and noticing this changes  this also means that if you don't try to look for help he might leave yoj down the road  Happened to me Very  very soon they will start leeching from you  Therefore you should cut them off as soon as possible  What good is family like that anyway  Let them fade awayEven if your family members were rich and looked like supermodels  they still would be jerks   how so   O P has put his dick in another woman  he has finger banged her  he got jerked off and kissed he has had the physical experience  he knows what to expect he knows how to approach it differently  he knows what he may like   Believe it or not many sex workers are willing to teach a guy the right technique if asked   O P is currently miles ahead of anyone who is a virgin still and the only difference is instead of chatting on tinder  going on dates he simply cut the bullshit and got what he wanted   Also many of the chad types out there who have banged tons of women usually are very bad at sex themselves as they get it in such abundance and for self pleasure that they have never had to really focus and try to please the other person   Just start smoking massive cigars and wearing  this shirt  http   reallystupidshirts com wp content uploads 2016 11 this guy fucks navy t shirt jpg   Serious answer  you're 19  You know literally fuck all about the world  Maybe you should actually listen to older people's unsolicited advice  Getting bulked up won't make you wise   Source  I'm old enough to be your dad   And another thing  I actually look a lot younger than I am  baby faces run in my family  I've only just hit the age where that is actually awesome  If you look young for your age  don't sweat it  your time is coming  Focus on becoming the best person you can be instead  including not believing you are owed respect  Earn every drip of respect you get  that shit's valuable If you're an old soul  you'll likely make older friends organically once you enter the workforce full time  varies by industry though   It can be hard at 19 to surround yourself with people outside your age group  I suggest volunteering or participating in a hobby or activity that generally draws older crowds if that's your jam  I actually think this is me when i'm at any social eventhow is this NSFW Why are you living with crazy people   Maybe try to find someone you're compatible with and that will support you and move in with them  yup Same    I honestly think that people like you and I only have ourselves to blame to be perfectly honest  Most people on this sub have  at least tried   but we failed from the start by not even doing that  Now our biggest obstacle is even trying without being an awkward mess of a human being    Yet despite knowing that I still consciously make the choice to not try   I think that there is a little bit of relief in being able to blame only myself though Spend at least 50  of each conversation listening carefully to the other person She's a close enough friend that she knows that I have a couple mental illnesses  The letter allows me to apologize without having to say it  As an emotional AF female  it's hard to understand me through the blubbering   I'm just so nervous  I've left her behind and avoided her  I don't deserve such a sweet and kind friend  and she would probably be better off without me you know   I'm gonna get started on that rough draft I guess   Thank you for all your input  No problem   Feel free to PM me if there is any other way I can help No  It doesn't improve sports performance  Really hard to make new friends because I'm really awkward  but I still have 3 really good friends from high school  Met them because they talked to me first lol  But those friends are all I need To make a joke  you need to first understand a person well  Otherwise  it's going to be a baseless joke out of context    So step one is to just talk to people  this gets easier out of high school  If you're at work  or at a campus  just say hi to the people you work or study with the next time you pass them by  Make sure to smile    This will indirectly familiarise them with you  They'll become accustomed to your greetings   I do this at work all the time and a good majority of people now initiate greetings with me because they know I'll be the one to do it if they don't     Ask them how their day has been  it's a good question to ask people you don't know well yet because they can choose whether they want to give a brief answer or elaborate a little  Eventually  you'll notice idiosyncrasies about them that distinguish them from other people  Something might happen in front of the two of you that you can comment on    It will get to a point where you wake up one day and forget how the two of you became friends because the process was so nondescript and gradual  But you'll also be at a point where you know enough about them to point out a humourous observation  Buy direct from an owner if you can  e g  on Craigslist   using credit from her bank  The used car lots pick up vehicles at bottom dollar from auctions  clean them up enough to sell  the catalytic may have been bad at the dealer  but they clear out the code to get it off the lot   and wash their hands of the deal  These dealers make their money on getting these things off the lot  and from interest when they give you financing      get her money back if she decides not to go through with the full purchase   Pretty rare  even for new cars  Look up the "lemon laws" in your state  but these protections probably won't apply to a used car  As mentioned before  these places want nothing to do with the car once it's off their lot  There's a fair chance they know exactly what is going to go wrong with it   Look for a clean honda or toyota on craigslist  and see if you can get financing via the bank  Budget a little to take he car to an independent mechanic for a once over They became disillusioned with other church members or realized it was all hype after others had betrayed them  Over time they figured out that family was more important No I'm only a sophomore and I do not plan on doing a foreign exchange  so I have time to prepare and stuff  Thanks and good luck with the rest of your career Thanks for the replies  I'm attending a private Christian university but for some reason I'm picturing self entitled idiots like I hear about on the news   Walk into the humanities or art or psychology building where there are more women and just wander around the hallways  Find a girl and ask hey do you want to grab lunch  She says no then say okay when are you free  can I get your number  Do this may be 10 or 15 times  If you're below the minimum for looks this will get you labeled a creep   No I'm not talking about how you dress or whatever  I'm talking about things like your basic bone structure   Yes even ugly girls will label you a creep for this You're welcome     sorry for how things are though  I'm sure what you're feeling certainly isnt any good  No matter what happens though I hope it all works out My wife just did  using all of the profiles and information we could pull up on the same person that is scamming him  At this point they've scammed him of 10s of thousands  It'll be impossible for him to stop and imagine all of that going for nothing  but has to stop  I don't think I can ever truly forgive my parents  as they don't acknowledge that what happened was unacceptable  For reference  my mother recently said "He's not your run of the mill pedophile " Wtf  As I said in the original post  my father thinks he can just ask god for forgiveness and all is fine  the same way he'd ask for forgiveness for any sin such as eating on a fast day     In my opinion  acting on pedophilia is unforgivable  it is an abuse of power  utilizing a child's trust and innocence to later harm them   It is despicable and I will not forgive that    But  I do want to move forward and I like your advice so thank you  Good luck to you too  Internet hug coming your way   Do you have condoms readily available  I know you're not trying to validate but I think it's just more about getting into a habit of making sure they are wearing a condom  There isn't much else you can do  because it is your body  If you're going to be doing adult activities  you have to do them responsibly  Make sure you have condoms out on the bed perhaps if you're expecting it or at least on a night stand Love doesn't happen because of a person  Love happens because of a relationship you've built with a person over time  I know that this woman is somebody you could have built something with  but the timing right now wasn't the best  maybe something will happen in the future  but not now  In the meantime  there are probably millions of other people out there that are just as good that you could build something with   I know that maybe that sounds dismissive  but it is what I think  You should respect that this isn't a good time for her for a relationship  and now isn't a good time for her  thin love isn't love I do  Both in real life and consistent online friends    I've never really found it difficult to make friends  honestly  Provided they're guys of course   I just run into people who share my interest of Video game and anime and those are two things I can speak passionately about without my social anxiety taking over  especially since I can connect with people regardless of what type of games or anime they like since I consume  everything  in those two mediums in my free time    Caveat to this is that I don't hang out much with them much since I spend nearly all of my free time at home He's a very old man who lives in the countryside  I don't think he would expect something like this and at this point it will be hard for him to imagine stopping and all of the money he had sent previously would be gone  I can't take it anymore  I've resorted to reaching out to that friend of yours who hates me    This hurts more than when my mother died  More than when I had to put my last dog to sleep    I know I said take your time  But don't  I can't take it anymore  It's not stated  but clearly implied that she wants that somebody to be someone she also likes loves  Otherwise  if it's not mutual  what is the point of being someone's "first choice"   Don't do "professor " because some of them aren't    They are all professors  if they are the professor for the class  and not a TA or other assistant    However  not all professors are "Doctor"That's ok  I cried every time I talked to them   they're used to it    Good luck with everything   I'm just there to meet girls  Probably seems pretty desperate in their eyes   Unless you're hot   Then it's ok I'm glad I am not alone  I am going to live off campus as well next year and I have a feeling that my chances of meeting people and gaining new friendships will be slim to none   I know there is someone out there for us who enjoy the same things we like  There has to be  But  maybe it will take some time  I hear that the best relationships come naturally without you even forcing it or trying  So I have faith that  that moment will come  They don't have any dungeons near you were you have have a dom do that stuff for you professionally to get it out of your system   They can do all that without actual sex    See if it's just a fantasy or an actual kink  They have strict protocols so you should be safe if you do your research well    Also if your kink matches Theo kink you're not going to scare them    Then there is the kink disclaimer lol my boyfriend and I joked about this when we started dating  it's a disclaimer you give when you have certain links before you get into a sexual situation that' usually goes "ok    we DONT have to do it  but I'm kinda into   blank        we DONT have to if you don't want but it's a thing I like that's not mandatory bla bla"  But that's more for when you start having sex  That's fairly young  I'm 24 and I'm  just  starting to see some of my friends get engaged If you felt up to it  it could be worth doing a little research into the way you're feeling  that way  if when you do make the step to speak to parents or a medical professional  everything feels a little less daunting     http   www mind org uk information support a z mental health     this is a UK based mental health charity  but they really clearly explain common mental health issues  When I first recognised signs of an anxiety disorder I literally printed off the relevant pages and circled the things I was experiencing to show to my parents because it was so much easier than trying to put it into my own words   Good luck    How do you eat your broccoli  some people do react to it if not properly cooked  Google that if you want more details   As for chicken  try to see if you get the same effect with pasture raised chickens    I've always had issues with beef  but once I went pasture raised  my problems went away  Don't know why  and I can't say the same will happen to you  but maybe you can give it a shotI don't understand this  Obviously for being a model  looks matter  It's kind of the  only  qualification  No one is looking for super models that have big hearts or outstanding comedic timing    People saw this guy's picture  and offered him modeling jobs  Yes  based on his looks  It is basically the main currency if you want to be a model   Congratulations to you   There's no harm in sending queries out there  The likelihood that you will get a rejection from the first one is high enough  but it's also true that that's absolutely the worst thing that can happen  Then you send out another query letter  Keeping writing and keep sending out query letters   The best way to get lucky is to keep being persistent     Good luck with your future endeavours It would be more accurate to say that fruit has enough fiber to moderate the usual insulin spike triggered by carbohydrates  I wouldn't consider it a significant source of dietary fiber I cant sleep I cant eat I cant breathe  The sadness is killing me  I own a box but even when it bring them  the problem is I dont enforce it  And I dont get why I have a mental breakdown like that and let it happen   Like the time I described  how dumb do I have to be to reward a guy for doing something he shouldn't  Looking for something to do for the next 6 12 months  not two years Since your a virgin you might realize you dont even like that stuff once you become sexually active  i know the things i thought i liked became irrelevant once i started having sex alot and found out what I actually likedAs a matter of fact  yes  And I'm still working on it  but once I got used to the idea life became a little easier for me  and I think it will for you too    I understand  things can come across differently than intended  miscommunications can happen  I see your side  As it stands  without her mother knowing she is unable to trust her family because they do not see her side nor believe it  which is something she wants to be able to do again  I guess it's up to OP to weigh the risks of what you suggest  and determine whether her parents may open their minds to the truth  accept that she experienced severe psychological trauma at the hands of their son  and be willing to repair their relationship with her This really helped  thank you for the long reply  i mean  there so many odd types so if i went over to him and says hey i don't think it would be so strange  it's not like i smell like beer and weed and ask for mayonaise     I will go down tomorrow and hopefully hes gonna be there so i can say something to him Wow Man  you just struck a chord with me  Never been to r sad before now and this is the first post I read and I feel like it might as well be about me  I'm really struggling right now but this post made me realize I'm not alone  Somehow the nice guy just never truly gets the credit he is due  but let's hope that it will be worth it to be a humble  compassionate and friendly individual in this worldHaha you're right  I am a girl  But  I have joined a fitness nutrition club and decided this semester to be more involved in it  Becoming a TA for the next year is also something I am considering  I definitely will seek out more clubs and be a more active member in it so that I can gain some friendships or opportunities to meet people   But I guess my biggest pitfall is that I hate taking the initiative sometimes because it seems like I am just being a nuisance  Especially when the people I am talking to just brush me off and don't equally contribute the same amount of effort to me    Thank you so much for your advice  next semester I am going to try to get out of my shell a little more  It's nice that I was able to focus on myself and my needs or wants  But  I know the social aspect is one that I am severely missing     I just run into people who share my interest of Video game and anime and those are two things I can speak passionately about without my social anxiety taking over  What  where   Most people I see on a daily basis are normies who aren't into this stuff  Granted  I'm finished with school and work at a company that makes products for normies and sports athletes Lol   Overalls are for farmers   Or 4 year olds   It's not that I have a hard time speaking about my interests   I'm certainly not keen on talking about my interests with a normie though IRL  not sure how you're able to do that so easily  it's just music in particular that people ask me about and I always freeze up and try to slither my way out of that subject    No matter how I imagine it  I always imagine that they'll react pretty negatively when they see I have an entire OST of some lawyer video game on my phone  after all  how can that be interesting at all As I indicated in the OP  I'm American  Doubt the City of Vancouver would want to hire a non citizen to drive their buses around  Good idea  I am going to look into some sport or fitness teams because I really enjoy lifting and friendly competition  I don't think anyone is surprised  Just sad  I never even thought about just inviting people I run into to dinner  I will try to do that this semester No  I really don't  and it's my biggest consternation   I had tons of friends in college  but making friends becomes very difficult as you get older and people drift apart with family and employment priorities Spend it saving your money  focus on work  spend alot of time im the gym  try to go on a date every week or two until you find someone you like  also you could maybe get some sort of degree like a real estate license or something  or even something like learning another language why don't you put your passions to use and design something    If you're into architecture and design  why do you take it as a serious project  put together a folio of drawings  plans  references  inspirational work that you follow and carve out the dream home you've always wanted to live in from loft to basement  Design the floor plans  exterior architecture  engineer it so it's a functional translatable design  design the interior  fill it with design you love  3D print a model  created a brisk leatherbound folio full of dreams and inspiration and keep it with you when you go to college    Even if it ends up on a bookcase and you don't open it for decades  maybe one day your kids will come across it and find themselves taken back to the moment when you found that summer to put together a project you could be proud of    And try and lift more    You are being paranoid  She wants space and you should just give her a break for a bit it works wonders  The pay is all over the place  from what I can gather  A handful of drivers in my city make between  70 000 and  100 000 per year  whereas the average in the state's largest city is  20 000    Bus driving just doesn't interest me  to be honest  I know how you feel about your "friends"  I've been through phases where I haven't had any friends and the best advice I can give is just to try and reach out to new people and find friends that are similar to you  Also you really shouldn't be worrying about not having a girlfriend  It's nice to have a relationship  but I really don't think you should focus on it too hard  As for college  keep working hard and try to let it occupy you as much you can  I found that I was mostly depressed when I had a lot of time to think about my own situations I mean it's still odd at 21 tbhprobably don't join the marines unless that's something that has actually been in the back of your mind for a while  Sounds like you have a decent plan though and good luck on the appeal man  edit  actually do what you think will work out best for you  even if you decide to join the marinesNo  never  High School is that thing that everybody goes thru but I will never want to experience again  Not even as an adult  The only people from the east coast that I still talk to are family  I will never want to meet anybody from HS ever again  You're confronting me with my biggest fear right now  since I do meet nearly everyone who shares my interests on campus    I know it's probably not so easy when you're actually out working There are tons of ways  but one might be better than another  depending on the person  Is there someone in particular you have in mind  Or is this more generic  Thank you so much  It sounds pretty straight forward      What the fuckSounds incredibly thoughtful and caring   One of the good ones    3Thank you Compliment them   on their looks  their personality  their work ethic  etc  If you see them doing something well  say something  It doesn't have to be every little thing  or even every day  but knowing someone notices at all goes a long way I don't have friends  In high school I had some but they were the type to only be your friend when their better friends weren't around  I try to do stuff with my co workers but they always flake on me  even when they are the ones to initiate the plans   Thank you It is  but it becomes REALLY fucking odd at 30  people also start to assume something is seriously wrong with you as a FA at 30  I didn't think about it that way  thank you David  if you are reading this    if you still love me    please come back to me  Please don't leave me at the mercy of the world again  It probably just depends on where you work  I'm sure if you work at a video game company  for instance  you can meet people with similar interests   Besides  if you already have a lot of friends it doesn't matter  I just fucked up and had almost no friends by the time I finished college Maybe take her on a picnic  Bring a basket with wine and whatever snacks you want to a park with a nice view or on a short hike to somewhere nice  You could do cheese and crackers  sandwiches  pastries  whatever you want to go with the wine I love my career  I work from home as a conservative news writer and commentator  and while my job is by no means easy and requires spending a lot of time verifying facts  I cannot envision myself ever doing anything else  Plus  it pays exceptionally well  There is also the fact that I am yugely passionate about news Agreed  it becomes weirder as you age  But even at 21 people still assume that there's something wrong with you and that you're weird  or you'll get the "aww that's cute" reactions like you're a puppy  Obviously that second one isn't as bad  but it still shows that you're treated less like a person and more like an animal Wow  thats a great answer  thank you so much Kick him to the curb honey  FYI  therapy along won't do shit  For one it'll take at least 6 months for any type of change  Per advice of friends in profession  sessions are about an hour  once a week  You have to "find" the "right" therapist  You do this by going to a therapist  trying them out for about 4 sessions  1 month   If you don't feel better  you go to someone else  I cycled through 3  stuck with a dude for about 6 months just because I didn't want to deal with the "finding the right therapist" process anymore  Then I quit therapy altogether  mainly because of my work schedule    Here is how I've treated my depression  3 parts 1  Therapy 2  Psychiatrict   drugs  very important  3  the most important part    SELF HELP  The above 2 parts are only tools to help you to help yourself    So if he doesn't have the will power to go to therapy  which is only 25  of the improvement process  yeah bad omen    Save yourself  that's my advice  Any chance he will give all this money to "her"     Then it becomes the rest of the families problem too The truth is a sneaky little bastard  Careful with this approach because things could get much  much worse Andre 3k could pull it offYou are 13 and shouldn't worry about things like this    You're likely not getting the full story  the best thing you can do when your parents are fighting is keep busy with your own thing and stay out of the way until things blow over  and even a little bit after the fighting has stopped      Some times old folks  and everyone really  just need some time to themselves to calm down  At 21 you are a loser but nothing more  A couple of years later  not even past 30 to be honest  women in particular stop finding it funny and it enters horror movie level of creepiness I assumed you were questioning your sexual orientation because of how lackluster these relationships were  how they ended  But I was trying to say that these particular guys might not have been your type  Nah  then you end up spinning a web of lies and get upset because people react and behave accordingly to the lies you tell them  making the relationship false   Just don't give the truth all at once  sometimes it can be a bit much  Don't sweat it  I feel the same way  I remember playing Donkey Kong Kountry at 20 yrs old and having my girlfriend lay next to me naked spread eagle with a smile on her face    Like giving me a test  Play the game  Or play with her  I choose her  But this is what was playing when it happened   https   youtu be wAPpVplHiDE  And btw I'm 42 now  And I miss being young and banging young chicks   Her and I arent together anymore  We broke up a yr after that night    So when I hear this tune  It really hits hard  And someone you can  literally  trust with your life He won't make an appointment with me for this reason What exactly did he do   There is a big difference between sleeping with a 17 yo and raping a 7 year old   You can't choose what family you're born with  Fortunately  you can choose the one you live with  I guess searching the Internet for local groups seems to be the answer  Thank you Try  r nofap for sometime and see if it has any effect on you  People report it making you more confident and full of life after you've kicked off your masturbation addiction  assuming  that you do     Abstaining from it raises your testosterone levels as well  which can make it easier to give off a "manly" vibe I'm sorry that happened to you  We've talked openly about it and I'm getting better slowly Stop thinking about food and it will just come to you when you least expect it  I'd like to  My personal situation only recently recovered from a bad time  so there are some other things I'd like to get in order first   pDoes have a brother  but polar opposite and in a relationship This might get kinda complex  but so are most things in life  and that's okay  You should know that it is really admirable that you want to help out your parents with this  and I'm sure that they would feel proud of you for it  But you should also know that whatever the problems they have with money are  you are  overwhelmingly likely  not the cause of those problems  and even if you are  you aren't responsible to come up with a solution  Please hear me out  while it's good that you  want  to help  you are  not obligated  to do so  no matter what  I don't mind helping you "brainstorm" some ideas for helping out  if you want  but in the meantime I wanted to tell you that first   If that makes sense or not  let me know  I'm 28 as well  I guess there's more of us than it feels like sometimes  Hope it works out for you too  Sorry to say this  but it sounds better on paper than it likely will turn out   you'll probably start out with a lot of passion and think to yourself "Yeah  this is great" and then abandon your pursuit and move on to something else  Happens to lots of people  myself included If a girl does like you then she's likely not going to admit to it if you confront her about it  without at least conveying a mutual interest in her   Girls have pride    I actually did this once in high school  I overheard two girls discussing me  and had both my first and last name confirmed  They were unaware I was nearby for some reason  but when the girl confessed to her friend that she liked me she was beetroot red    About a week later  we were talking  and I just dropped it on her without any indication that I was interested in her  because I wasn't   And she refused to admit she liked me  so I dropped it  I said a swear Possibly but only because the government holds the hands of the people and dictates what they can and cannot have where 'drugs' and 'alcohol' and 'tobacco' are concerned   The difference is that the people who do drugs and smoke and drink realize they're killing themselves slowly  The people who just get very overweight and gorge on sugar are convinced that they don't 'do drugs '   If people are really dumb enough to classify sugar as a drug  I certainly don't  then it  should  by all means be regulated and taxed like every other drug   That's why I put 'do drugs' in quotes whenever mentioning obesity  It is dangerous and it does have serious consequences but anytime someone suggests that things like soda be taxed  Americans lose their minds    It should be taxed  And if you really believe that sugar has ruined more lives than alcohol  I completely disagreeit ruins lives but only those who are reckless enough to gorge on it irresponsibly  then certainly you would agree that it should be taxed and regulated as well  correct   Because you realize how dense that would sound to suggest that sugar 'ruins' more lives than alcohol and then believe that there should be open  unfettered  untaxed access to it for children and those who are obese    Not to mention that massive amount of health care costs associated with caring for obese Americans  If you tax alcohol and some of that money goes into the healthcare system and you tax cigarettes  and boy  do they  and some of  that  money goes to pay costs associated with smoking  then   absolutely   sugar should be seriously taxed and only sold to those over the age of 18   Right   Right Completed  but there were 1 2 questions where it seemed to link two items together that didn't necessarily go together for everyone  I answered as best I could  but if you write another survey  you might want to double check that your questions don't assume linkage between feelings  He makes payments every few weeks of up to  2000 5000 and thinks of it as an investment because "she" will pay him back once she boards her plane and returns home to safely since she is trapped in nigeria  Problem with this is she should of been here by last christmas and now he is paying for 'hospital bills'  and everything else  honestly it's probably a nigerian penthouse for two scammers Just do it  one  more time  And this time make it count No  I understand  It's like connecting the dots  When you feel better you will feel better about yourself  You will also look healthier  rosier cheeks  willing to smile more often  take more care with your appearance  That can lead to others noticing and liking what they see  It can also open the way for you to take social chances that can lead to new friendships and relationships  If you want friends you be friendly  Everyone doesn't dislike you but it can be easy to convince yourself of that over time  Just fight back against that destructive thinking and do more positive things for yourself that will break the mold you are in  Make a new you that is healthier  more fit  and thinking more positively about your life and your future  Others will notice  Start by changing your tune      Believe in yourself   Tell yourself that your about to get a job   Stay positive and let the real you shine through     Get realistic   Looking for a job is a full time job   Mind your appearance and dress up  Shirt and Tie    Comb the block and knock on doors   Don't ask if they're hiring  ask if they're accepting applications   If you get an application  ask who you need to return it to and when they will be in   Be respectful and thank them  even if you don't get an application      Make a floating resume   This will be a resume template that you update   For each job you apply for   think of a relevant life skill you have that pertains to the job   Always keep a neat and  printed copy with you   Do not use regular white paper or card stock   You also need to make a cover letter each time you turn your resume in   Look for volunteering opportunities to help bulk out your resume   It shows that your willing to work   Another way to bulk up your resume is learning the basics of sign language  while you won't be qualified as an interpreter it adds value to your resume because its something helpful and unique    If you took any foreign languages in high school  list them and tell them your working to become fluent in them    break out your old books and work on them      Take what you can and swallow your pride   Figure out  your bills and monthly budget   Once you figure this out it will narrow down what jobs are feasible for you   You don't want to end up in a situation where your pay is barely covering the cost of gas   No matter how nasty it is if the pay is good take it  You can keep looking for something better but you always want to have more funds going in your bank account than coming out of it   Temporary staffing agencies will be your best bet to hunt something quick     Network   Ask your friends and family to help   If you haven't been getting many hits  start using different references   Check your social media and make sure nothing questionable is popping up   Keep a page of 7 10 references handy so that the same people aren't getting called every time     Have a goal   Ask yourself what your dream job is and where you want to be in five years   Work on obtaining the skills to get you there   No matter what job you take you will attain transferable skills     Do your homework   Prep for interviews by practicing with other people    Practice smiling and using a firm handshake  Iron your clothes  and  wear your shirt and tie   these will give make you stick out positively    Avoid colognes and body sprays  your interviewer may be allergic  Don't forget to look the company up and know basic information about their goals and what they do   If there are two people in the interview make eye contact with both people and give equal attention to both  some employers use others to ask the questions while they judge in the background    After the interview send a personalized thank you card or a phone call   usually within 3  5 days    Obviously I don't know you but your husband may be minimizing the whole thing for your sake  like he sees how much it bothered you and is trying to bring you back closer to neutral instead of adding to the negativity  It's probably what I would try to do  Like others have said  make sure he understands how big this is to you  If he feels differently about it he might not recognize the gravity  Above all else  don't do anything hasty  It's crazy how much a little bit of time can help  It could and probably will be awkward  but strong friendships can withstand things much worse than this God  you're an idiot    A lot of people ask questions they already know the answer to because they want to start a conversation  A lot of girls ask for help from guys when they don't need it because they want an excuse to interact with the guy    Conversations shouldn't be one sided  They should be reciprocal  If a person says the phrase   '' I once knew a rocket scientist   ''   it's not because they don't know it's uninteresting    It's because they're triangulating with you  attempting to find a common point of interest that you both can relate to and hope that it leads somewhere interesting as conversations have a tendency to    Sometimes people fail at this and come across uninteresting  but hey  at least they fucking tried  That'd be wiseKeep quite  go on like nothing happened  It may go a way Sorry for the late reply    My doctors all did the same thing   trial and error   and I don't think there's anything wrong with that  Prescribe what works for many people and then if that doesn't work then it narrows the field  Regular doctors do that with things other than mental illnesses  doesn't make it any more pleasant for the patient though     Anyways  about the cheek swab thing   This is the test I had done  http   www millenniumhealth com services pgt testing   I'm not an expert or know any of the right science words but basically they look and see if you have gene phenotypes that cause medicines to work differently for you   some people actually metabolize certain drugs better or worse than someone with the "normal" type  For example  I learned that I don't metabolize folic acid well and  folic acid is really important and can improve symptoms of depression  https   examine com supplements Folic Acid   and work as a supplement to other medications  So I take Deplin  an already partially metabolized version of folic acid  L methylfolate  along with Wellbutrin and for the most part that keeps me stable  Previously I was on 3  antidepressants or antipsychotics at a time  0 10 do not recommend  and so now I just take the two and that is enough  My doctor may have not prescribed Deplin had she not seen the results of the cheek swab test   While googling I did see that  Millennium Health is involved in a recent lawsuit involving unnecessary testing  https   www justice gov opa pr millennium health agrees pay 256 million resolve allegations unnecessary drug and genetic  so I don't know if my doctor was encouraged to do these tests for an ulterior motive or just jumped on a bandwagon or something   Hope this helps  If you have more questions I can probably answer them without getting into too much personal medical information He raped my siblings when they were pre pubescent under 12 years old  I don't know the exact details I have friends now a whol bunch   But after college until maybe 26 or 27 I had none    The thing most people already have their friend group  THey have their friends from college HS  work  They dont need them  They pretty only reach otuside of that group for dating    So yeah you can talk to someone   even regularly but that doesn't make them a friend  It too me finidng people who had the same hobby before I spent enough time around someone for it to be worth their time to actually be someone who existed outside of the hobby    Even then it became mostly people who were divorced with friends who had  not time for them  YES I'm a quiet person  talking to strangers makes me very anxious  To the point where I couldn't see myself playing online games that require communication    no online friends   I don't have a social hobby  I keep to myself and don't make an effort to talk to people IRL  So I guess that adds up to no friends  if you don't count a couple of people from my old high school that I haven't spoken to in months  I'd strongly recommend that you talk to a therapist about this  Imagine if you got drunk enough to black out or otherwise lose control of yourself  That may not be your normal pattern  but shit happens in life   The safety of those around you is considerably more important than the inconvenience of you not drinking  YOU may not see it as a risk  but I'd seek a professional opinion about it  I don't know what's the thing with coming out  you don't really have to do that you know  I don't think a straight person would have to come out   Plus  it's better to pester your family with homosexuality  LGBT movies ect until their tolerance levels get a lil' up  Wait until you're financially independant  Hi  thanks for posting     First tip  Do things   MetaFilter user "mollymayhem" once gave this advice   "Don't just get coffee or drinks  that puts all the pressure on you guys to entertain each other  Do something that entertains you guys together  Cook together  go for a walk  go to an event or concert "  "Ease and comfort does tend to come with time  though "  She's right   When you hang out with someone  go do things   Even something simple   e g  just walking and talking through a shopping mall or down a busy street or in a store     Second tip  Ask what's new   When I talk or hang out with someone  early on  I'll ask something like   "So what's new with you since the last time we talked "  Then  whenever there's a lull in the conversation  I might ask   "What else is new with you "  This helps a lot   Or  if applicable  you could ask about their dog  or how their classes are going  or things like that     Third tip  Or you can discuss current events   As  u Sarquon mentioned   weather  news  holidays  etc   Spend five minutes reading the local or national news every so often  learn what's going on  and then this might give you conversation topics    Note that it might be wise to stay away from religion and politics   For example  if you're a Democrat  and the other person is a Republican  the other person might decide that they can't be friends with someone who supports Hillary Clinton    Today is Tuesday   The weekend didn't happen so long ago   You can ask the person how their weekend was  and if they did anything interesting     And a question     Every time I try to have a conversation with anyone  I have nothing to say  my mind just goes blank and it's just an awkward silence until they leave   What's the context I recommend  r nofap does wonders for you Why aren't you in school or working  I'd fix that first  Proud of you Yes  that's unforgivable   I wouldn't want anything to do with him either   But even if you can't forgive  you can work hard to not make your anger and pain ruin your own life   Good luck Is that a text to my mom Chiropractor yeah  I think it's helped a little bit  Really enjoyed this response  Absolutely true that you have to show vulnerability  It's what putting yourself "out there" means  You have to trust that something good will come out of it  Sometimes nothing does  But sometimes you're surprised by people and yourself and that's when truly amazing moments can happen    Like OP I have the tendency to assume people don't have anything to offer me  But they won't offer anything if I'm not offering something  as well    Anyway   This whole post and the responses have really made me evaluate a lot  could be hit or miss  sometimes they feed off the reflective energy more than anything so if you just let it pass through nothing happens  it's less about letting them win than just defusing their energy  but def a person by person tacticI only have encouragement to give   I've been dealing with this same thing and I appreciate that you're honest on here about not feeling great again  I was doing really great for most of 2016 and now that we are at the end of the year everything feels like it's falling apart and I just want the other me back  It is hard to admit I've been really down but I guess here on the internet is a start and I'm just really glad to see there's someone else out there who knows how it feels  So thanks for sharing   I try to remember that every time I start feeling bad again  it's just practice for me getting help  Hopefully every time I start feeling bad I will notice the symptoms and not take as long to get help as I did the time before    Are we looking at the same subreddit  Imagining myself in OP's place and damn that one would feel good   OP  fuck all that noise  Inter family jealousy is so sad and ugly  You're killing it and you know you're killing it  keep on keepin on brothaThere's also a post where she claims to have  had a threesome with a roommate  but now  shes an 18 year old female virgin nerd  OP has me confused as fuck What is Jeremy Kyle   give herself up sexually  Hahahaha what  Read  then respondI agree  you may really bond over this   You both are really dealing with the same thing different scenarios   Fathers are much more than DNA  and if you didn't know for seventeen years then this man really must love you You didn't kill the dog   you were trying to help and he didn't understand  Take time to mourn  and then forgive yourself Yeah  that's funny too   My crush always loved to complain about how every guy she meets likes her sister more than her    Like I'm chopped liver or something  No  it isn't normal  My friends and I were all going out at that age drinking and banging broads  Remember your only young once  Embrace it and have fun   Lol the strange thing is  I'm 42 now and I live the same as you now       Short version is mental illness  It hit me hard through my teens  and that   family situation really screwed things up for a while  As much as I love discussing blanket statements I don't think   all of us   are picky  Of course I think as a human being everyone is entitled to have some sort of standards  Me myself am ugly as shit and have relatively low standards but yet get rejected even more because every below average girl I knew and or asked knows she can at least get an average guy  Which is true  Based on my own experiences ugly guy has it worse than an ugly girl  Demand and supply  That's all     Downvote me all you want in advance if you wish  I figured if we are throwing blanket statements I would throw one as well Aaand it is goneWe offer expert

accomplish it  then that's that  There is nothing they can do to make it a success and if their plan depends on you doing something impossible  then that's their issue  Hold your ground   You don't

better than minimum wage but less stressful than your current job  That would look better on a resume too  I'd think    I'm not telling you not to quit  it sounds like you really  really need a different job than this for your own happiness  But if it's at all possible to find a new employer  while  you're working there  I think that would be ideal  If it can happen fast enough to save your sanity  You the king crab  manThat's true  and I'm sure you'd like to be contributing fully to some company  rather than just get charity  not that there's anything wrong with accepting charity    I'm so sorry that you got turned away from those positions  That's awful  If you can do the work  you should be able to hold the position Exactly  they want to pull you back down to their level Gonna let you in on a secret  Most people can only count on one hand their true friends   Its true that many people will count their gym buddy or the person they hang out with  when they go out  Those are acquaintances  Often times it take hitting rock bottom to find who your true friends are   So your perfectly normal   Focus on doing the things you really enjoy and you'll find true friends   In the meantime if you need someone to share with you can PM meYou probably won't ever know if he seriously planned on telling you any of this  but I bet he's thought long and hard about what he would say to you if you ever found out  I'm guessing it's the kind of stuff you'd want to hear from him  You should definitely talk to him  and make sure he knows that he is still   and always will be Dad Stay how you are  The most precious thing you have is your originality and you should be confident about yourself for having different tastes jail true story Are you searching for a job  Sounds like you know your problem perfectly I really hope you get that other job  because you NEED to get away from BR  They are totally screwing you over and it seems like they're getting a sadistic pleasure out of seeing you suffer   I would suggest getting some kind of therapy  I'm assuming you're seeing a doctor and or psychiatrist for the diagnoses and the meds    you need some positive reinforcement that mental illness is not always psychotic in nature like your family keeps telling you   If you haven't already please also consider subscribing to some of the depression anxiety etc subreddits where people who are going through similar issues will be happy to talk to you and help you cope   I have several forms of mental illness myself  and though treatment has helped  as well as getting away from toxic people   it's still good to know I'm not alone  I wish you well     I hear you  I recently realized that my senior aged mother will say something "contrarian" no matter what I say or do  I guess some people are just like that  Maybe if you expect it to happen it won't bother you so much   yeah   that won't happen  Why can families be such dicks to each other Stay strong mateIn one's worst moments  like those deepest and darkest times where you literally feel like there is no hope  That's the stuff that makes a person    You have a choice at this point to rise up outta this or sink even lower  Ask yourself  What do you want to do  What are your passions  or things that interest you that you could do and become passionate about     Figure that out because you first need something to motivate you  This jumpstarts the change  Then look at ways in which you will be able to set some goals and move towards your passion  Remember  shit ain't gonna be easy  and you WILL want to quit  But keep going  Day by day making progress in some way or form    I'd type more but at work  You get the idea  Pm me if you want to chat more  maybe internet it's a good solution go chat i dont know what to do professionally but just know the sun will rise tomorrow  things can and will get better  smooth seas never made a salty sailor   you are strong and can take on the world if you wanted to bud  just hang in thereI know my coffee intimately  she is a bad girl and requires sugar   As a sugar daddy I know how to treat my coffee Again  I don't think you even read what I wrote  At no point did I suggest she do anything sexual with him  I even expressed that he can't even risk being seen as a creep as he could lose his entire career  If that's what he wants  he needs to let it be known  and she has all the power in this situation There are too many contexts to provide a generalization    In American English  'graphic' has been wrenched out of its historic definition to mean lurid  shocking  or explicit  some examples include 'graphic sex ' to mean sex is realistically simulated or is real  'graphic violence ' to mean the violence is realistic  whether simulated or real  'graphic imagery ' to mean you're going to see something gory   I would guess that visual retains its historic meaning  which is related to sight    you see something  which may be really in the world or which may be a photograph  animation  illustration  moving picture  or the like  Often the illustrations are referred to as 'visuals ' with one being a visual  The 50s usage was visual aid    it helped to see an illustration of what was being defined or explained   Historically  I'd say graphic meant a visual art  not necessarily a visual aid  A graphic would be used to refer to some visual art like a drawing or other illustration  Graphic arts would often be used to refer to line work    drawings or engravings or prints such as travel posters of the 30s  40s  and 50s   But without a contextual setting  I would not generalize that they mean the same thing My gf is a beautiful lady who seems to have been verbally beat down over the years and doesn't didn't take compliments well  but I just am persistent and she's coming around  Just encourage and don't give up  Believe me  they like it but are just socially awkward in most cases to respond the right way Figure out why you get like this  maybe go to a therapist  find out at what point your behavior becomes socially intolerable  But if at any point  being drunk means you will become physically or emotionally violent  quit drinking  Good for you  Just try to remember that it's ok to be sad and to feel those emotions   After a while though it's important to start trying to do things to distract yourself and over time you'll find that you're getting better   Feel free to pm me any time if you want to talk because I understand how you're feeling Relax  buddy  You're in high school  If a person seems awesome in high school  it's mostly attributed to rich parents and good genes  It's after university when you really start to shape your life  You could try picking up a skill of you think you're too boring  though most people aren't Haha exactly and no problem at all  Again feel free to pm me any time if you want to talk because I understand what you're going through and there are going to be some ups and downs before you start to really feel better That's the one that stuck out to me  too  Had my tubes tied at 22  Best choice ever  My then boyfriend's family didn't think so  This  This I what I did and was in a very similar place as OP  You have to pull yourself out f your own muck and make baby steps forward  Before you know it you'll be making long strides You should have taken the bus too I'm gonna be there in less than 2 years This is easiest for me to explain in the vocabulary of improv  which I have recommended in this subreddit a few times now to people wanting to improve their social skills   small talk   flirting skills    The golden rule of improv is "yes  and"  When you're talking to someone  99 999999  of the time there are no stakes to what you're talking about  so say "yes" to whatever situation or information is being presented  improvs call it a "gift"  because anything new that improves brought to the table is really valuable  and continue the thought by adding to it  A slightly lower stakes interaction is called mirroring  because you're basically acting on the other persons ideas  not your own  Mirroring is a tool for filling in some gaps  but yes  anding is what takes you to a better place  You support  encourage  and inspire people by yes  anding skillfully  Everybody feels good  and it doesn't matter if it's real or if it's nonsense  because it came from you  and the whole point is to find out who you are anyways  It does take a little bit of guts not to immediately criticise yourself when you get silly  or make a dumb joke  That's all part of the vulnerability of flirtiness though    The other part  the part relevant to control  is called blocking  It's basically the "no" to the "yes" from the previous step  Notice how you had no ability to reject the other person when you're yes  anding  The direction of the conversation is an amalgamation of the contributions that you both make  and if the other person is contributing similarly  it can feel like the conversation is getting away from you  It can feel like you lose control  even though  in context  everything makes sense  and it might even feel really good  This is why blocking happens  and this is actually very little to do with the words in the conversation  and a lot to do with the feelings   Some people have been improv athletes their whole lives and they never knew it  They thrive on this feeling of lacking control  and they play with it  It's a powerful "tool" that you can use to manipulate people into admitting things they don't believe  or make them feel really uncomfortable  on purpose   but when your goal is to support and create an interesting conversation  the feeling of lacking control is actually a great barometer for how well the conversation is going   But it's more important  initially  because most people don't have access to or the desire to take an improv class  to realize when you are "blocking" a conversation from happening  Blocking can be when you literally say "no"  or it can be a hesitancy to follow someone into their own suggestion  or it can be something exterior like your body language or your plans for the day  All of these things are choices that we make to keep our lives in control as we see it from the perspective of our identities  When you are with a person you trust to like you  and want to be with you  this kind of interaction creates a destructive wall that makes it difficult for any meaningful reaction to occur   Intellectual conversations are a difficult point because in reality  most "intellectual" conversations are incredibly inane  People either want to impress others by talking about this thing they found  or they want to criticise someone else's idea because they found a small error in it  Both of these modes of conversation are based in unhealthy mindsets  and there are plenty of intellectuals that only know how to talk on these terms  The ones that get far in life are the ones that make sure their sources are better references  but that doesn't guarantee happiness    I have found balance is much more important  There is a type of social intellectualization that happens between people with high social intelligence that is indestinguishable from small talk  and the only way to learn how to do it is by practice  Better yet  it's a skill that benefits every aspect of your life  and it gives you more and more the more you practice with it  This is all I am saying  in a nutshell Medicine will not magically fix you  in fact it usually takes months to see a full effect  I think you should seek help  go to your doctor or see a psychiatrist if you think you can't handle your anxiety any more  You might "explode" if you try and handle it all yourself    People will get different medication depending on what they need  so I can't just give you a list of side effects  I take fluoxetine  an anti depressant  for OCD for example  I got diagnosed when I was hospitalized  I got diagnosed with OCD almost immediatly since it was the main problem  but I had to take tests and give my parents tests to get evaluated for ADHD  I think diagnosis differs depending on the situation What's written in your contract When dealing with food allergies  the adage its better to be safe than sorry is highly appropriate  Because unexpected allergic reactions can have fatal consequences  allergy specialist encourage the public to practice caution Similar thing with one of my favorite AP course teachers  It blows my mind  but hurts the heart much more so Just thought I would let you know  the board accepted my petition and accepted the C  as my grade so I have officially graduated   2017 has been great so far  cheers man I went through something similar  If you go this route and there are family members you do want to keep in contact with but fear you will lose  you can reach out to them first and explain  "Look  I'm going to put some distance between myself and X  I don't want you to feel caught in the middle or like you have to pick sides  so I won't go into detail on why  They might say things about me  but I would prefer not to know unless you feel like you  need  to talk with me about it  I just want you to know I care immensely about our relationship and hope we can find a way to keep it going "  Good luck  Well since she is sort of ruining the bonding time why not just go around her and invite him to something for you both to do  I mean if she gets to go skiing with him and rub it in your face  what's stopping you from going skiing   When she's not around or anything just ask him to hang out or get his number and invite him after work to go see a movie  a get together  or anything  It doesn't have to be serious or anything you can say "Hey I just want to grab a bite to eat wanna go to this place "  I mean it sucks you have someone constantly ruining your time with him  but I think a more direct approach is needed  You don't have to say anything to her just ask him to hang out  If you can't get his number just msg him on insta and either give him yours  get his  or just plan it from there  It only feels like you guys are 14 because kids that age don't normally communicate like adults    Hope this helps and I hope my advice is ok for you  Best of luck I work with patients and clients all day long and sugar and their addiction to it is very real and can cause a cascade of health problems both short and long term   As corbie mentioned  those are the main culprits and the majority of people improve their conditions once they remove them   We also see more serious cases that are patient specific hence why we run specific labs for their physiology but "most" people do much better eating healthy fats  quality protein augmented with fruits and vegetables   Always here to help   Your not being paranoid  your service engine lights are on for a reason   You need to pull over and check the issue   Communicate with her and be sincere   Approach it from love and not spite   Never accuse her of cheating  if your  wrong you can't ever take that back   Get some rest and calm down before you talk  to her You're absolutely right   there's more to relationships than just looks  Through our talking  she seems like a very sweet girl with a good head on her shoulders and a good heart  which I guess adds to the "seems too good to be true" battle I'm still having with it all  But still going good so far   so I'm just doing everything I can to realize   remember she  in a way  made an effort towards me   take that at face value   and don't get ahead of myself  Definitely easier said than done but I'll be the first to admit I'm an idiot for being anxious like that  Working on it I am looking forward to that   Zzzquil for a couple days usually puts me right on track with a new sleep schedule Specs Rootin' for ya brother Read the second tweet     It's impossible for him to rape because anyone would love it  Read it repeatedly and internalize it I wish that were trueThat doesnt necessarily have to be a negative thing  I myself have a lot of things Im passionate about  and trying things out and realize its not for me is a valuable experience  The contract does not outline what happens in the case of them damaging my property  The work to be performed in the contract says posts to be set in concrete between garage and house with a 5 foot gate  Which was changed to a 10' walk through gate  but that's not the problem   The contract also doesn't mention anything about the direction of the fence  or anything with quality of work  I do know that they are insured  I'm not sure if that makes any difference in this scenario Won't make a difference  you guys have decades of abuse and ill treatment  it'll always seep through  You'd have to look like that at most since early adulthood  late teens    Later than that it's like congenitally blind people that get surgery and suddenly can see  They can see  the nerves work fine  the brain gets the signals but they can't process them  They opt to go blind again   TLDR  You're fucked  Yes  it is bad if you don't send thank you notes  People will understand why they didn't receive notes during the six months you were overseas  but now that you are back  it should be done  Phone calls are nice to catch up  but don't replace the thank you note  Everyone should receive them    It may not seem like something that is necessary  but you'd be surprised how many people keep track of these things  Your guests took the time and expense to come to your wedding and give you a gift  A thank you note is a small thing to do in return Unfortunately in life  no one will ever be permanent  But there is beauty in what can be temporary  Think about all of the great times you have  Live in the moment and love those who are close to you  You will have people who become life long friends  and you will have people who are just short clips of your life  They are all important  Just remember  your train doesn't stop for anything  It's a great idea  do it immediately and leave ASAP  This guy deserves no favors  she rested her head on my shoulder my heart was beating so hard for something so little that i started sweating    I put my arm around her and it felt amazing  it's not like we were a couple or anything  but it was so unreal  I eventually got a semi by just dreaming about us cuddling more    Eventually  her sister was tired she was driving  so they had to leave  they left without saying goodbye  I didn't ask for her number  hmmm maybe I should have  I don't know  no regrets having been that far with a girl for the first time  we didn't kiss if you were wondering     I shed a tear for you  brother   What a missed opportunity   any chance of seeing if your sister can try to find out who she or maybe you can Facebook her   That being said  the paragraph I quoted above means that this was a success  despite everything else   If you can do it once  no reason you can't do it again     Don't sweat it  you did really good IMO  I just played super Mario Galaxy again in years  Didn't realize how shitty it was to play player 2 Thanks  some good points as well as some stuff I left out  I have enough to last me 3 months without employment if I am careful  without incurring any debt  As well  I have a very understand SO who is very supportive to the point of offering to pay more of the rent or move somewhere cheaper  I could possibly help support myself through private music lessons  and various other small jobs I am skilled at but nothing that would result in substantial income   I have applied to over a dozen coffee shops  minimum wage but pertaining to my future business plans   as well have been looking for better paying jobs I would enjoy more  and are more local  Only 1 so far but not going to stop looking  However  my lack of an official diploma may limit what is available to meI wish but it'd actually not cheaper  He can't be covered by medical insurance over there due to his age and paying outta pocket for one is expensive  My grandmother feels like a home is the safest option but we are all to sad to get it done lose Sad to say there should be a disclaimer at the beginning of the movie that says "based on true events" since 16 is pretty much the minimum age to have sex at nowadays   tear  Don't cut off your contact with your family because you vented on the internet and strangers told you to  The default response to any relationship problem on Reddit is almost always to ditch the other party  This audience will not have to live with the repercussions of your choices  3 Hope for the best for you   I feel you with the friend struggles nope nobody bullied me    NORMIE GTFO REEEEEEE  Lol true and I don't want to use internet because its like    You never really know who's on the other end but thank you  ill have to try it anyway ya know Dude  that's nothing  You'll be fine  Just get more tattoos then you'll care less about that one lolIf I really needed as much money as possible I'd part it out  If I just wanted to make a quick buck and be done with it I'd sell it as a whole   Do you want to deal with 6 8 transactions or just one I'm restricted to  nobody    ever    Not even another F A would want meGo brag somewhere else normieHey internet stranger    I don't know if what I say has any weight to it but I'm going to tell you anyway  And im sorry if this ends up too long     All of 2016 I was intensely depressed  I hated my job  I was having trouble coping with my parents basically dismantling everything I knew about my life up to this point  My dad got remarried in less than a year  I couldn't talk to anyone about it because I didnt want to seem lame  I pushed away everybody I could while still trying to keep up with my expected persona    It basically kept spiralling downward  In May  I decided if I didnt feel better by July 30th that I would prepare a list of things to get done by the end of the day  letters to write  and research the highest point in the metroparks to jump from  I wrote it down and everything  Had a list in my journal like any other to do list I've written for a store or chores  I was relieved  There was a plan  Some control  Something to look forward to I guess    A week later  I went out drinking with friends  Got absolutely smaaaaashed  I met up with my boyfriend and a couple of his friends at another bar and continued to drink everything i could  When we started to leave I started walking and he chased me  I screamed at him  Told him to let me get hit by a car  I wanted to run to the edge of that street and jump off the overlook at the end  I was sobbing  begging him to let me die    That was the last night I drank for 6 months  I thought I might be happier without downing gallons of depressant every night  It helped    for a bit  I thought I was out of the woods and just wouldn't drink ever again  But the darkness came back  I started fantasizing about how I would feel as I fell from a cliff  Would I stand at the edge and jump or would I take a running leap and fly down    I forced myself to tell somebody  And then somebody else  And then somebody else  It was freeing  I hadn't realized that my deep dark self loathing secret was strangling me  It was the heaviest thing I ever felt and it felt so good to finally tell the truth    I'm not 100  yet but I can tell you that I don't want to die anymore  I forced myself to get out of the house when all I wanted was to crawl deeper into my couch  I listened to comedy stations on pandora  danced  put on makeup for no reason at all  But most of all  I'm doing everything I can not to let that darkness come back by seeing life and the world for what it is  It's weird  It doesn't make sense and everything you might have ever expected to happen might not    In my experience  letting go of everything I tried to control was the most helpful  I just want you to know that if you hold on and talk to someone  Write things down  Work through the rubble and find your way out  Please do everything you can to save you  Don't stand in your own way by not doing everything possible to survive    Wow thank you all for your help and telling me your stories and posts  I'm glad to know that it's not just me and that it's kinda normal  Makes me feel a little better about it I won't be too judgmental  since a lot of the posts are on DPP  where people live out fantasies  and OP has mentioned some things related to this    But I also won't take things too literally either Wow     You stepped in  poop    You poor thing  So he just sent pornography to a minor Meh   Usual  load stuff for customers  make cash flow  do heavy lifting for female coworkers since they don't wanna    You get minimum respect from both patrons and coworkers alikeOne more thing  In college  you ought to check the bulletin boards every so often in the hallways because all sorts of posted opportunities will be there and you may find something that will be significant for you  things happen like that  Good luck Something we just have to accept as FA unfortunately  normie scum have to keep us in our placeHow on earth did you find a doctor  Usually they don't even consider a woman to be able to make that decision until she's past 30  Because obviously your 20s isn't adult enough to know what you want Thank you for your feedback  I know medicine isn't magic but at this point I feel I can't manage it on my own and it's starting to control my life  Get smarter   Figure out what can a  make you money and b  fill your soul   It's at that intersection that you'll find what you can do  work wise  for the rest of your life  happily   Good Luck Sex sells    we can only try to ignoreAre you working  in school  living at home  Do you have hobbies  interests or belong to any clubs  Do you spend a lot of time online or just focusing on what you don't have  A lot of what people will say to you depends upon your individual circumstances because good advice for one person might be toxic for another  To be completely honest   you do already sound pretty creepy  You've been thinking about this girl  who you call a  godsend   for hours and she probably has no idea who you are  You don't even know anything about her   she could have a boyfriend  not be interested in a relationship right now  not have the same personality interests as you  etc  Alternatively  maybe you are compatible with her   but you'll never know that if you don't talk to her   On the plus side it's unlikely she knows about any of this  so to answer your question in the title  you can avoid being creepy by striking up conversation with her and not treating her like some sort of perfect mystical being that has graced you with her presence  She's a human being just like you  Idk about "normal"  but I'm there too  It kinda sucks  but oh well  I guess Diablotek case of unknown model worth about  40USD  Diablotek DA series 500W power supply  ASROCK Z68 Extreme3 gen3 mobo  Intel i3 2120 cpu with stock cooler  Corsair Vengeance 8GB  2x4GB  ddr3 ram  1600 mhz Same thing here man  But the reason I don't flirt is because I know nothing will ever happen  so why bother wasting her time and mine  It doesn't stop me from acting super nice and like a gentlemen though to the girls I have a crush on  Which in hindsight seems like a terrible idea  Because when your crush tells you she's always wanted a perfect gentlemen after you've done something nice sweet for her  And then the conversation goes no where because your too scared to think of a reply  just absolutely sucks    But yeah being super nice is the extent of it  I surely won't openly hit on compliment my crush  Because I wouldn't know what to even say  let alone how to say it without being nervous  If being super nice and acting like a gentlemen somehow can be taken as flirting  then I sure as hell never realized that I definitely wouldn't say that I love her  I've only known her for three months  And it's not just sexual attraction either  Like every once in awhile I'll picture us going some stuff that couples do  you know  I just don't have any way of "ceasing all feelings I have for this girl " I can't just wake up tomorrow and be like "oh that's it  no more feelings " I know this sounds really dumb and I appreciate the advice but I just don't know what to do  There are some things that it's acceptable to use FAFSA money for  I in fact just used my fafsa to pay my rent  But using my loan and grant money  fully aware of how much I will be expected to pay back and when  allows me to only work part time and gives me adequate time for my schooling so I can get good grades  This will allow me to get a better job after school  making it easier to pay back loans and contribute to society    It is fully expected that part of your fafsa money goes to pay your room and bored  Food  rent  utilities and transportation all fall under that    That all being said  it sounds like your friends are blowing through this money  That is entirely different than budgeting to live a minimal lifestyle and focusing on school  This will all come back to bite them  Eventually  the money will run out  or they will have to maintain decent grades to keep receiving it  Once that happens  they will be in a tight spot  Hey  feel free to message me if you want dudeThis is the honest answer  Although I would agree most people only have a few true friends Your his best friend so that says a lot as well  So I'm not the only one with the "chest in pain" thing     I have this feeling too   That's a pretty good point  What do you think would be the best place to sell  I know there's craigslist and  r hardwareswap  my problem with hardwareswap though is that I've never used PayPal before and it's somewhat intimidating  This is my first time selling anything like this  so I'm kinda swinging in the dark It's not "normal " nor should it be  Seek counseling if you don't have anyone to talk deeply with  It sounds like these are emotional problems that can be solved or at least managed with therapy and medication  it's worth it if you're feeling lonely People grow apart or lose touch  It's common and expected as you go through life  You can still be "friends" but not have much to do with each other because you have a history together and that is a good thing I blame my parents for most of my social inadequacies  We were always poor as fuck and they grounded me to my room for nearly my entire highschool for things such as putting "too much meat" on my taco  4 months for that one  and there wasn't too much so fuck you mom   In public school I had a circle of 30  people I'd hangout with on the regular  at least once every 2 weeks   They finally started treating me like an adult when I went to university but my shitty social skills  depression and lack of experience with drugs alcohol  not to mention the fact that 90  of my family are addicts  so it's likely genetic too  made me give up everything in life and only care about getting high drunk  Now I'm just a skinny white trash fuccboi with low self esteem and no job  Kind of fucked that even simple things like grocery shopping are learning experiences for me because I essentially have the emotional maturity of a 14 year old I'm in a similar situation to yours  though I do have a car job  My job is what I credit for almost all of my improvement in social skills during the last couple of years so that could be worth looking for   try to find a job where you work with various people in your age group and have chances to chat with them relatively often  I'm in food service   But yeah  I really have no idea where to make friends either  being in the suburbs is weird  There's just not anywhere that screams "Great place to make friends "Haha yeah  Title sounds like a humble bragI would pm but I'm not entirely sure how to do that lol  Thanks comrade
