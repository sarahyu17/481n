Yeah it happens  I'm free to talk here or PM   Gotta keep your head up  don't think about it find something to keep you busy I don't blame women at all  Honestly if anyone ever did date me for some crazy reason  i'd just feel really sorry for them  I jusst did it  While you're at it  fuck 2018 and 2019  heck  fuck all the way to 2099  No need for more years  Fuck 'm all  TV series  Find something out there you like  with at least three seasons  and you're gonna love it  For me Cymbalta worked really well for anxiety   also had you noticed in the post  i'm not addicted to opoids  Like I said  I tried them one time  the second time  I was going to but got rid of them instead    As far as the alcoholism goes  I've had to quit cold turkey for a couple months at a time at points  when suppliers moved away and such  I never had withdrawels and within the five days since my last drink  none have occurred  And this drinking was literally so bad  for some one my age I guess  but bad for anybody I assume  That I would drink and then make myself throw up just so I could drink more  This didn't happen often  I have not had any withdrawals of alcohol ever    And I'm not on prozac  but what did you mean by withdrawals from that  Or Cymbalta or whatever    What is Cymblata  is this something I should talk about with my doctor   Xanax  of course on the lowest dosage so far  has had no noticeable affects in my mood  Maybe it helps anxiety and I just don't realize it or something    And what is suboxone     NALTREXONE and SUBOXONE are medications to keep you from doing drugs and drinking    SUBOXONE is an opioid that blocks the effects of any other opioids  It's also sometimes prescribed for pain  I'm thinking if you have pain issues it may not be a good idea    Naltrexone is for addiction ss well but I take it to help with the night eating I get from my antidepressants     Xanax for anxiety is going to flatten your personality out and they also need to be increased constantly because its short acting  Maybe consider Klonopin which is better suited for someone who doesnt want to pop pills all day  I've had them all and stopped because they are the worst to come off of   For anxiety I had great luck with Cymbalta but everyone is different  For anxiety I found the Beta blockers work best  A low dose of Inderall helps a lot   You have a dangerous alcohol problem  The binging and purging thing is interesting  While I don't believe in addiction I do think your drinking is a symptom of some sort of personality disorder   As a safety net try naltrexone for a month so you can get ahead of the drinking and focus on what the problem is  You could have ADHD for all I know  Symptoms range from a total disregard for your health to getting hyperfocused on substances  Sucks about the shots     Good for you mate  Have fun   IRL  I have met many wonderful people and a few that were complete sociopaths  The issue is that sociopaths are like black holes  everyone gravitates towards them and nobody can escape their grasp  Most social circles have one at their core  not unlike most galaxies   It's not that good people don't use the internet  Most everyone on the internet is faceless  It's hard to feel shame when one knows that they are anonymous  It's even harder to feel empathy for someone who is anonymous  A certain awareness is required to step back and realize that everybody that one interacts with on the internet is a living  breathing human being  I get that this is a depression subreddit but maybe we shouldn't encourage others to "resign" from life it is a special kind of headache  Stimulant overdoses are usually painful as fuck    I'd recommend you get to an ER or call an emergency service asap it's really not a fun way to go    If it's any consolation to you I went to bed early on NYE  In fact the holidays seem to have passed me by with the only noteworthy event being my virulent head cold  Facts I do desperately try to speak to her and get ahold of her but otherwise I'm not like your ex  I love her  I really do  It just breaks my heart to be without her  I can't move on and I won't move on   Thanks i appreciate you sharing your experience  It is really hard on me but at the same time based on his behavior it does seem like he is genuinely suicidal  He called me from work and told me he was going to just go leave and kill himself  He said he was just calling me so I could tell his family he was sorry  When I asked him how he planned on doing it he said he wouldn't tell me because he didn't want me to try to stop him  I begged him to let me pick him up from work so I could take care of him  I feel like an awful person because for a brief moment I felt like I should have just ignored him and let him do it if he really wanted to  But if i don't stop him then I will feel responsible     be successful  This is the key  I struggle with it myself  I don't want to be successful  I HAVE to be successful   But what is success  Try to ask yourself what YOU want  what are YOUR goals  What if nobody was judging  if anything was possible  Whats your personal success gonna be   You are adequate  You are worth it  I like you just the way you are  Goodnight I'm absolutely lovesick and heartbroken   Yeah  I went cold turkey off of Wellbutrin last year  It ruined my brain  as I now have seizures  I wouldn't recommend it  Just slowly wean off to be safe  I am pretty much the same  but two years older  and I didn't gratuate high school  Well  I just seem to keep going  Maybe it will get better  Same Here Wow totally describes my relationship with depression and emotions  or lack thereof   Doing that right now  Once you are drunk it isnt that difficult  but alcohol always goes both ways Alcohol  video games and cycling  That's the stuff  Even the drink can't help getting through this night my God my head feel like it's got a ton of weight on it  This  I think I'd do well I don't really need those 2 things anyways I am  therefore i must post  Hey  I love you too  man  I hate that you're going through that right now   Does not have the same ring to it though  Hip new year perhaps  Why 12 34   It's ridiculous I have to drug myself to not want to blow my brains out   To dupe my brain into thinking it's happy   I still hated life even when I had 10k in the bank   Ridiculous  I don't even know why  but this really made me smile  At the end of the day  we are all different and different things make us happy  Being happy is really the only thing that matters  i think    Idk Yeah  that's nowhere near enough  Hi  Same here  I didn't even have anything I can do  but still it feels bad  I live in the middle of nowhere so i'm not hearing any noises outside  but I bet it feels horrible  But remember it's ok to be not doing anything special  I'm really not the right person to tell you this cause I'm feeling sad too right now  but I want to try cheer you up   try to make you happier  i'm not sure of my language   I'm not sure what to say to you  but try not feel bad cause of your decission  If you feel not going anywhere it maybe is the best to be home then  Think  would you have had fun really  if you decided to not go  Or if you really feel you want to go  is it too late yet  There is still people out there  if you really want to celebrate with others  I really hope you would feel better tonight  It's a hard evening to be depressed   Well at this point I consider I have turned insane  Better than my 2014 15  but pretty mediocre by any measure  Yours  Sounds like you've tried it all   Sorry you haven't had better results   I don't know what to do next  I'm 47   divorced for 3 yrs   with 2 teens at home  I hardly have time for myself let alone dating and I have managed to get myself in such a rut that I have no idea how to get out   I've heard all those quotes too  Everyone will say how funny I am   how kind hearted pretty etc  just put yourself out there      But noone gives me the time of day    I know i wear my crushed heart all over me     and  this rut has made my depression and loneliness and complete fear of putting myself out there again almost unbearable  Tonight   New years eve    Kids are at their dad's   And I'm here  Alone  In pj's     And honestly have no idea how to make things better again  Please help   Thank you  Yes Well   I'm really a thin person for my age and people used to insult me by saying I masturbate too much lol  But I don't really mind  I couldn't do anything about it so why bother  I eat but can't seem to gain weight  I blame it on genes  Shit  If it doesn't change and it bothers you report him Thank you  Happy new year  For real pm me if you ever want to talk about it  I could enjoy having a single girl friend to vent with  me too  ugh To start  you might want to read this http   www cracked com blog 5 facts everyone gets wrong about depression  Yep  exactly the same for me  This is me  What makes it worse is that it's been exactly two years since we've been together and I'm still feeling this way  That's the most embarrassing part  Its been two years   Go travelling  have some intimacy with a girl  be happy  Now hold on a minute  You can't do that without finishing your job here  as you signed the contract when you were born  What do you mean you were'nt conscious being  Well who cares  Your mom and dad put the sign there for you  I've been working a lot to stop reminding me how fucking lonely i actually am  First christmas vacation i spend alone  I decided to repaint my room and to get some new furniture  which is nice  I've also been talking to a nice girl  which is nice i guess  And we all have survived another year  I'll have a drink for you guys  cheers Same  I thought I made a new friend but he didn't even invite me to his own NYE party  You've only just begun my young friend  It will get better  You are loved   Caffeine is really fkn disgusting  Tried the Same in June and i puked for like 3 days I know it's hard and scary  but the best thing would be to talk to someone in your life  Parent  teacher  someone  They can do more then any of us can Please don't  You're worth so much  To your wife  To your kids  They need you  Life is a gift that you only receive once and there will be times where you think things will never get better  but you have to believe  I know you're probably tired of believing things can get better because it seems as if they never do  Please live on  Live for your family  Live for your friends  There has to be something that brings happiness into your life  if not then find it  Please live on  Would you be able to talk about it more     were here  What about working pushes you so much  I can never seem to be able man up and do that  I have to explain to my parents about my phone and I still haven't done that  I don't think talking to them about this will come any easier  Thanks for the exposition shithead  You wish for success  but you focus on the current  ground level problems  Thats how you solve things      Still  knowing this did not help me  but it still might help you  i guess you are much younger than me  What did you cry about  If you'd like to talk    good luck on that sleepover  i hope you make friends  Im rooting for ya  Here's to 2017 being better than this shitshow of 2016  2015 and 2016 were fkn hell Have you tried talking about this with your husband  How he keeps getting on your nerves instead of helping you  He seems to care  as he asks you how you're going  but clearly he isn't helping  There's nothing worse when you're not feeling well than having someone pestering you like that  I agree with the comments below  therapy helps  Talking about it helps  You need to let it out  Have you got any friends to whom you could ask for help  Also  something I discovered last Winter when I was very depressed  physical activity is beautiful  Run  swim  do anything  just move  The chemicals in your brain will do wonders and it'll be great for your health  It helps me a lot  When it gets too dark in my brain I go for a run and it clears the clouds away  Hope this helps  Happy new year    I know these thoughts  I know how much they hurt   What brought me peace was this   life exists here  From the harshest environments to the most docile  life exists  It doesn't do this because it's easy  or because it has a purpose  It exists because it CAN  There is opportunity and there doesn't need to be a reason    Yes  things lead to pain  But they lead to happiness too  Sometimes the two aren't equal    You're here because you can be    inside that is infinite possibilty    inside that is hope   Not everything will happen  but anything CAN happen   If you want to talk more  I'm here    Oh geez    Thanks for the warning  Sorry you had to find out the hard way  Feel free to pm me  I'll befriend anyone in this position You have all my sympathy for dealing with the UK mental health services  They are terrible  Have you tried going to the gym or physically getting the anger out  Or having a moment for yourself in a nice hot bath  How about hobbies  Do those calm you   You are not a waste of oxygen  We humans are pretty bad at dealing with our brain going wrong  It's all well and good knowing you have nothing to be angry about when your veins are pumping adrenaline into every muscle  If you were  your husband wouldn't be asking if you were okay   as silly as it is  it shows that this super angry person isn't the normal you  This is an exception that he still wants to tackle together with you  Nobody asks a waste of oxygen did they'll share their burden with them every five minutes    Finally  don't throw the notion that something in your life is wrong too far away  This might be your body's way of telling you in its non verbal way that something is REALLY wrong  Usually anger is the extra energy our body gives us to change something that is upsetting to us  It might still be that  even if the cause might not be obvious to you or something you feel shouldn't be upsetting you  My recommendation would be anger writing  Next time you feel on edge  grab yourself a pen and a journal and let it all out  Everything that comes into your head  You should be tired  but less angry afterwards  Then go back to what you have written the next day and see if you can pin point a source or reason   "But you are such a good BOY"      I am 26  I lose hair already  OK  happy new year     3  I titrated off of it and a few others at the same time  try to structure it the same way  pace  as you went on it  A few pills less one week  even cut them in half  then less and less each week slow down if you don't feel right  I mean  less right than usual in an abrupt fashion  happy new year to you  just here to say someone saw this and cared  on the same track as you man  keep going    I felt like there was more purpose to being alone tonight than anything else Mind you this was on my own  not under doctor supervision  It isn't easy  But there is no formal way it needs to be done  Try writing it down    just take time    and then show them  You can do it    and it will help I am tired of them too  My personal experience   1  I am 30 y o  I have lived in different countries  different continents and met all sorts of people  Not many people attract me beyond their physical appearance  but when somebody does  it is a completely different feeling  a different type of presence  an unmistakable smile that you want to see everyday  Yes  I have met the right person  and she is not with me  Only I know what the feeling of what meeting the right person to me is like  no one has the right to say I haven't met the right person for me   2  I definitely love myself much beyond the average person does  I eat well  I am healthy  I exercise  I don't drink nor do drugs  I am vegan  I love nature  Yet  I am depressed  I have had more failures in life than I can bear  Loving myself doesn't change that   3  I know it doesn't fix  However  not being in a relationship adds to the depression  And it gets worse as you get older   4  I have tried  And I have to tell you  today people are weirder than ever  People are more judgement  they are more politicized  more attached to their thoughts  more narrow mind and more resistant to loving one another  Society nowadays is not a welcoming place for a depressed lonely person   Honestly  I don't have any helpful advice  All I can say is that while the loneliness is extremely painful and haunting  there will be moments in life when you might ignore it  moments in which you might find joy elsewhere  I have struggled with this all my life  and if I knew a way to deal with it  I would not be here  Should I reach out to her since it's a new year or would it be too expected or corny  I feel like I have lost too much  It is just painful  But thank you for caring    Maybe you should be thankful your garbage genes were aborted     you've imposed a shit life   shitty world onto a child  good job  I've been thinking a LOT about shutting down facebook recently   I didn't even wanna be on it to begin with    and wouldn't have  if i hadn't been dating someone who pestered me into it and had a bunch of terrible friends who convinced her something was wrong with me for not wanting to be on it     The downside is that it might make it harder for people to reach me after having been out of contact for extended periods of time    which I think it's somewhat useful for   Also for people who just know your first name  don't know anybody you know  and maybe wanna get ahold of you for some reason   Aside from that  it's pure waste   Fuck facebook  Hey  you tried something new and found it isn't for you  It's a risk you take when doing something you haven't done before  Now you know that lying in bed isn't your thing  You could have found out that you absolutely love it  Try not to interpret more into it than a single failed attempt  Just go and do something next year   Noice  I'm attempting dark jokes to cope with depression now and it's a little hard but I think I might like it  Happy new year Yep  people who've never been in long term relationships have NO idea how alone you can feel  even while you're in a relationship   Hope it gets better  My wife doesn't care anymore   She tells me to my face   We haven't even made it a year   I can't stomach the thought of her being with someone else or another man trying to raise my kids    I don't have any friends  And my family can't even help telhem selfs   She's just going to walk away from me and not care  i'm in basically the same situation  wishing you all the best  The worst thing I hate hearing is "stop being a negative thinker" for the love of god dont do this I personally hate these types of advice  because they honestly just make me feel worse rather than help  I can't get mad at these people either because I understand that they are just trying to help but don't understand  I really don't know if this will help but I have pretty much given up with actively looking for love  I realized somewhere along the way that life doesn't center around love  If you manage to find love then go for it  but don't pressure yourself into looking for the right person  If I ever manage to find love again that would be great but if I don't thats fine too  I don't think there's a support scheme where I'm from    And I don't think I'm eligible for it since my dad is actually earning decent wage  it's his stupid spendings that worries us most of the time  I've been undergoing treatment for quite some time now  and I've been complaining about wanting to quit my job and sit at home for the past  5 months or more  Told it to my therapist  saying  "If I can choose  I'd rather not work " She said  "So do I  But this is reality  we have to work to survive "  Sigh    She's right  but this is really not what I expected from life  I'm still not accustomed to living as a cog in the machine  being an insignificant part of this indifferent society  Omg  fuck that  Feeling you guys tonight  Have you attempted to make any change since last year  I admit I'm terrible at this and sometimes I feel like I literally can't but I think that's another part of the condition  It turns your reality into hell and then takes away your ability to leave  Stay strong friend I know it will sound like if i want to make a joke or make you feel upset but       Your mom can't die twice  right  What else is there  to make it worse  It already made you "hollow"  can it be more than that      Death of my mom will be my end  There is nothing worse that can happen in my life  Nothing  I've already stated it times and times again here  I alienated everyone so less people are gonna hurt of me going after her  i am just waiting now  She is 67 and every time i think  say or write this number it terrifies me      Guess how many people called me this NY celebration  Fireworks all over the place  but there is only my mom calling me and this   odd friend from my past  who shows up every new year for some reason to watch me playing video games for an hour  Sometimes it seems like i am already dead and its   thrilling  Can you tell me one      I think I'd rather stay at home and do some housework  I have a knack for cleaning  But    That's if I get myself a spouse  because I highly doubt I'll be  I have not been romantically attracted to anyone  and finds it illogical to do so  Basically I don't believe in love  Also  I'm born male  so it's further stigmatized if I stay at home   Part time doesn't give the attractive salary that full time has    And the benefits are way less  which    Isn't worth it  I don't know    Oh god I'm so confused  Two people called me  one of them is an odd old friend from my past who shows up every new year  another is my mom      I am playing Dying Light on Nightmare and listening to TotalBiscuit's Arbitrary Video Game Awards   2016      You can have fun alone too  In the end  cutting is just a coping mechanism  It doesn't say anything about you as a person other than that life is demanding one hell of a lot from you right now  If you can  try your other coping mechanisms first and see if the urge goes away or try getting help with some of the things you are struggling with  You would rather hurt yourself than give up  even if the world is being a nightmare  That makes you strong  not weak   Good job  The demons are you  they can't leave  You either tame them or live in terror      Tfw i wrote it and realized how accurate this actually is  Same  Feels fucking fantastic    While I don't believe in addiction I do think your drinking is a symptom of some sort of personality disorder  As a safety net try naltrexone for a month so you can get ahead of the drinking and focus on what the problem is  You could have ADHD for all I know  Symptoms range from a total disregard for your health to getting hyperfocused on substances  Sucks about the shots   What does naltrexone do  And why would this lead you to believe I have ADHD I'm trying     i love you too Video games and watching series mainly  It sucks when I run out of that   best distraction is going home to my mother but I only can do this on holidays   If i ever do something wrong even if i correct it or if its not a big deal  my mind just shuts down  Instant self hate mode  I dont dislike working but i just shut myself out too much if something goes wrong  I feel like i cant help it that sucks Take it to PM  I'm trying not to be suicidal here and even with the subreddit gone I still get to read petty squabbles    I'm just gonna chill tonight  because I'm exhausted from work  I want to go to a party but it's a solid hour away  So instead I'm just gonna chill with my bro  order pizza and just enjoy my evening  Tomorrow is a new day  No matter how bad last year was embrace tomorrow even if it's hard  I was once told false positive motivation can turn into real motivation   It's true  Belive in yourself and admit the flaws you have  Then slowly build your life to be that way  Happy New Years all  Well it's December 31 2016  I'm tired  Tired of fighting my demons tired of my physical pain and tired of my emotional pain  I've been fighting my demons for the better part of my life and tonight is the night I will finally win  I'm taking my wife and I laws to dinner and to wherever they want after to make sure everyone has a good time while acting normal like I always do  After we are home and I've had enough booze to kill an ox I have a series of drugs that I will be taking to eventually stop my breathing and my heart while I sleep  I will apologize now to my 16 year old son whom I cherish and 2 unborn children that my wife is carrying not to mention the few members of my family I have left that truly do love and care for me  I love you all and will see you in my next life  I hope others are stronger than me and can over come thier demons  Love to all and take care  Those threads are making me sad because people are putting wrong meaning to the word "love"  Maybe its just me  but pretty much any similar word with less power would be more fitting      Edit  fix  Not like stand up but I found it funny when people were talking about how so many celebrities were dying in 2016  Then a comment underneath was like "lucky bastards" and that made me laugh XD Totally understand  You just want a solution and there's this huge temptation to just throw as much as you can get your hands on to the wall to hope something can stick  But slow and steady wins the race unfortunately   Exercise and generally focusing on building small healthy routines seems to be the only thing I've seen be truly in our own control in regards to pushing us closer to healing    Hope you have a great new years as well  Hopefully 2017 is better than 2016 I'm so sorry  Here if you want to talk  As far as wanting to hurt people  it's possible you're just really kinky but these thoughts may be an indication of additional mental illness  in particular i was reminded of this  http   www cracked com article 21834 5 realities life when your brain wants you to murder html  you should probably see a medical professional and discuss both issues with them  If I haven't explained enough or you just want to talk feel free to pm me Really depends where you are living  I live in Germany and English is my second language  maybe that's why "I love you" doesn't mean too much to me like in German "Ich liebe dich"    I can see why you are sad  I wish somebody would liebe me    But I like you  if that's fine  To break 50   ATM my "normal" days are heavily under 50  of the year  i want to at least come closer to it  Hi how are you doing Should you be upset  What makes you upset  For me parties were always like  this  https   pp vk me c543100 v543100141 17b9f z1Lmv0G9gcE jpg  I like your point of view   Good way of looking at it all    I hope I can get to a place of being ok on my own with or without love again   thanks this is really cool  Nice job  D I can relate to you so much  I just feel like every year is getting worse and worse  I'm pretty much the same age as you too   Linkin Park   The Messenger I read the whole thing   I can empathize with some of it especially classroom anxiety   I used to drop a class if I thought I would fail or do poorly  but I changed my policy to powering through everything   I lost a lot of percentage points for attendance and participation  lack there of   I would definitely watch a documentary about your life     Take on each issue individually and try start with achievable goals  Progressively improve on them  Dont be distracted by social media and others more privileged  If you wanr to use it fot your benefit find idols that inspire you  not all of them had it easy  You have a hunger to succeed that they dont   use it to your benefit  Your english is good keep working on that too  Lastly you are young  Good luck  I didnt really read the post sorry  But if u cant even remeber ur name and shit like me see if u have adhd  I hardly remeber my name I cant even fucking spell because who gives a fuck   really  haha honestly you have a girlfriend she most like u to be dating imo I would just keep doing what ur doing ur making her happy   And trust me life is faliure since i was born  My thoughts are with you  Even if you couldn't bring yourself to doing it  remember that you tried  you considered it  you reached out to someone for help  That is more than a lot of people do and it is brave  Remember  one step at a time  I know we want to fix everything all at once  even though we don't know how  Don't push yourself beyond your limits  but do try to focus on at least one goal to achieve  Even if it's as simple as getting up and making your bed in the morning or walking around the block  if you can acheive these goals perhaps you can achieve something harder in time  I hope that even if things didn't go the way you hoped that perhaps you feel lighter knowing  even if it hurts  When we hit rock bottom  there is only one direction to go  You are kind and brave  I believe in you   Dude talk about some bullshit  I hate that list shit of things to do  it makes me so irritated hearing it but it's not like your situation  It's just my chores at home from my mom whom I love   In your case man  forgive me  but I honestly think they're assholes  Exactly  Im wishing college will go well for me so at least i can feel a bit better and concentrate on fixing myself  but it all seems hopless to me right now  I wish you a happy   better than 2016   year  i got your back bro  keep your head up  it would be nice to have people to go out and do something with but im here sitting on the computer  no one calls or texts but i barely know anyone  ya this feeling sucks  Back at you friend  here's to another year I just don't know what the problem is  I'm not bad looking  decent height weight  ok job  I do have confidence and social skill issues but that does not really come off when I first meet people so it's not like they can see through me that I'm depressed  Each rejection is like a hammer hitting a nail  making me go further down and down each time  until eventually you just want to give up  there is no satisfaction in life anymore I agree with everything you said  Except I dont think there is a meaning to life  Where just here to exist and tbh I really dont want to  Appreciate ur comment tho Metallica metal  'Fade To Black'  Another one of their songs 'One' has a similar vibe but may in fact be even darker I know  Saying it feels like beating a dead horse but it's true  I'm a student physical therapist interested in working in a collaborative practice focused around the treatment of mental illness  I know several centers that employ a physical therapist to work with patients suffering from mental  not physical  ailments because it's so  so important    I have my own fair share of personal experience with mental illness and I accept that for me personally  I  have to  do some form of exercise every day  some days vigorous  some days active recovery  I  have to  eat well most of the time  This is on top of medication and vitamins  probiotics  fish oil  and rhodiola  It takes upkeep  But it beats being so depressed I let my life pass me by while I rot in despair and emptiness   A big tragedy and part of my life's work is that a lot of people have a very narrow concept of what they think "exercise" is  They think of the gym and they hate the gym  I hate the gym too  But I can run a marathon and move over 100lbs by myself  partly because physical therapy is a manual labor job   I love being outside in nature and so that is where I exercise in my spare time  Other people like being social and might enjoy something like swing dancing or rec league basketball  Others yet might be curious about yoga or pilates  Some don't have any interest in exercise whatsoever but can commit to walking 30 minutes a day if they think of it as part of their treatment  Movement is medicine  Some people like it  some people think of it as a necessary evil  but the key point is that it is in fact  necessary  for good mental and physical health  I am still learning how to best convey this to my patients but if they only listen to one thing I say  that's the most important take home message   We survived 2016  no problem surving 2017  I really hope so too  Hopefully being away from my family  who trigger my depression  will make things better  I feel like I probably won't even get into a good university though  I have zero motivation to do any work   I still haven't watched to the point where Shepherd dies  I think I've gotten as far as he witnessed a car accident Last year I was decluttering my room  11 foot by 11 foot room completely full of junk that I've had my entire life  When I say completely full I mean you could barely even enter the room  Like what you'd see on tv level bad    Anyways  I was all alone last year and didn't have a bed or a couch to sleep on so I got drunk alone just sitting on my floor in a corner until I fell asleep    What proceeded that New Years was by far the worst year of my life  Dog dying  being abandoned by the very few friends that I thought I had  Dad having a massive heart attack are some highlights  There was quite literally zero positive days for me in 2016   I feel so much worse today than exactly 1 year ago  The only difference I felt like a year has made is that I have a bed to sleep on tonight    I don't really know why I'm sharing this  I guess your post just reminded me of myself  The one thing you definitely should not do right now is overthinking  Bothering about it will only cause you to branch on worse thoughts of why is that so and what is he doing  Find something else to think about and you should be fine for some time      Edit  fix Advertising yourself as a helper and especially inviting PMs as a first resort are both against the posted rules here    What's on your mind buddy  I know i would enjoy it and join them if i was truly myself  but i cant help being miserable That's me  I'm sick of all these people who "know better"   Yeah no shit I should meet more people  but it's not that easy  I'm scared af to meet even my friends  not sure why  Nothing bad happend in my childhood or something    Yeah  maybe it gets better  Maybe I should love myself before somebody else should love me  Maybe I should meet more people    But I just can't  I'm sorry but I can't  I was at a new years party that was pretty tough  A ton of happy drunks  A lot of "PP  why are you moping  You should have more fun"  etc  I just can't feel like that anymore  I suffered through it and read this subreddit on my phone not to feel alone   After a bunch of people had left  someone asked me publicly "What are you doing on your phone  PP "  I said "Reading  r depression "    That changed the mood quite a bit  but then we had a long talk about depression and therapy  Everyone talked about the things in their life that they were struggling with  and it felt 10x better than the stupid new years countdown   Happy New Year   r depression  I hope things work out for you  xoxo  I'm in a club right now  just as lonely   Agree  please report stuff like this as it violates the posted rules and we will remove it as soon as we find it   Thanks for the tedious lecture  genius  My year hasn't sucked as much as yours  but then again it isn't really a contest  This year I was diagnosed with Dissociative Identity Disorder  had to abandon two friend groups because I was too dumb to realize I was the asshole  BOTH TIMES   and had two relationships that I had no emotional connection to  I'm about to go into another one and I don't want to fucking do it again but I don't know how to stop it   So here I am  alone again on New Years Eve  listening to The National  just like I was last year  The only change is I have no hope for the future  Even though I'm still very young I just can't see it improving  especially not with what I learned about myself this year  Depression is hard to deal with end of story  But there is hope  Stay strong    we are all here in the same boat with different problems  I have been where your at  It may seem hopeless now but You will get trough it  Ive been depressed for a long time  I dont know what you are going trough right now but the pain will go away and you will learn how to deal with your issues   3 Friends invited you  Don't feel bad for liking for someone  Its not like you choose you like  I met this awesome girl same interests same hobbies and most of same banter etc    In my mind shes perfect girl but she has a boyfriend  So yeah just continue talking to her be her friend if it is meant to happen you'll find out  Yo yo mate I think same i was in a taxi and was thinking i wish a sniper would shoot me xD  but dont feel bad for liking someone its not like u choose to like her its just human instincts imo May i ask if they were online tests  Because im pretty sure that most 13 year olds feel like they have SEVERE ANXIETY DEPRESSION PTSD BIOPOLAR because they went online and took a quiz telling them that because they feel sad they have depression I relate to that but coming from somebody who's never felt attached to his family you should hold on to them in your darker hours  as long as you're not being a burden on them who says you need to move out  Don't feel pressured by what society says is "normal" you do what makes you happy  This year I will be happy  that I can guarantee   Sorry it didn't help  Sorry if I'm stating the obvious here  but that's just good ol' depression for you  The funny thing about depression is that it's not always sadness and hopelessness and crying  sometimes it's just    numbness and nothing  Depression is also when you don't feel like doing anything anymore  when you lay down in bed all day  with a hole inside that can't seem to be filled  staring at a wall  trying to will yourself into doing  something   and then waiting for the day to end so you can rinse and repeat  It's not wanting to do anything  even with things that seem mundane like getting up to get something to eat or a cup of coffee  it's not enjoying things you used to enjoy  it's apathy and anhedonia   Be careful    the rash is a life threatening reaction from this medication  Go to the ER to be sure  You can do anything you fuckin want man  Hate Workin  Get a job that ain't work  We're in a new generation where you don't just grit your teeth and take life's phallus your whole life to "maybe" retire happy  Fuck that  And you know what  I don't know you  but if you posted here then you wanted help  And that means that you don't like that you're unhappy man  And good on ya  Maybe I'm drunkenly talking out my arse though  New year  New you    I want you to know something   This is normal  It doesn't make it any easier  but you aren't alone in feeling this  Millions of 13 year olds are feeling the same right now and many are going to be able to move past it  I hope you can  I want to warn you not to fall into self destructive behavior and to try to get help  Avoid drugs and alcohol especially because you could form very VERY psychologically harmful addictions  And most importantly  hold on to your friends  I wish I did  even if you don't really like them  Someone there who doesn't give a shit is still someone there   Remember you're 13  you have two ways in life  Either you conquer it  rather you minimize it  eventually or you just get used to it  There is always suicide  but don't do that  There's really no point  You'll get out into the world soon enough and then you can do whatever the fuck you want  Maybe not  whatever   but you're far more free   Just hang in there  dude  Thanks  I really hope I can get into somewhere at least semi decent  Do you not get a student loan in America   Hope 2017 turns out to be brighter for you Hey im 25 and live with my parents  Honestly it sucks sometimes  My sex life sucks  My friends have moved on  I just work and feel like a robot stuck in the same old routine sometimes  But you know what  I love my parents  And they love me  Im sure your grandma doesnt hate you  Try to spend more time with her so she knows you appriciate everything she is doing for you  I promise you whatever she "hates" you fir tonight doesnt mean anything long term    Dont let the the hateful attitude she may sonetimes give you impact the way you feel  Im sure it can be resolved    Its a new year new start new opportunities to grow closer to one another  I dont mean to sound supwr depressing but your grandma won't be around forever  I know i was 11 when mine died and i didnt get to say goodbye  My other grandma has alsheimers so i slowly watched her mind slip from her  Take advantage of the time you have with her by doing whatever you can to make her happy  Even if she has an attitude or whatever  I promise this will make both of you feel better everyday living with one another  Just letting you know what my grandad said to me " Where living in hell now soon as you die you go to heaven " Does matter what ur dad does it makes happy thats all that matters its his choice and im glad something brings join to him  and we are all responsible for our choices imo but if it makes u happy go for it  Legit u work for a job u hate i appreciate that i cant even do that  Working for something someone u Dislike that takes balls  U need the money and u do it  I dont care  Anytime    What have you lost  If it's ok me asking    Thus this post is pointless  1  Waiting does nothing ffs  It won't magically get better by itself  Just "being out there" and "being present" also doesn't do anything  I could do this again for years without  any  results  It's very  very hard work for me  nothing else    2  Me too  Telling me to love myself is like telling an arab guy what's the best snow to ski on    3  No  but my problems are the reasons I'm not in a relationship and I'm certain that a relationship now and then  could be  related to happiness  and a feeling of selfworth   Just an idea of me   4  And see how few things I am able to do  Observing others who are healthy and having fun  Yeah  that worked well for years    Not sure what I can tell you  Have you tried online dating  It might be easier  You too  happy new year    It works for me  explains a lot actually   Feeling very similar  You're not alone in this    I could leave it and do anything else  But I'm having so low energy and no idea what to do else  Dont worry about Facebook  Not worth using  And there is nothing wrong with spending some time alone  I hope you have a better 2017  Stay positive Will do from now on  thanks You dont need God to be happy xD people still belive in santa etc     Plus im proud of u bro grill     I'm glad u found something that makes u want to be happy  I didnt read much of it but  Atleast ur looking for a job and shit that takes alot of effort imo  I cant be arsed getting out of bed tbh   Atleast ur trying to better urself thats all that matters imo  People call ur lazy etc    who gives a fuck ur trying and i appreciate that It is kind of sad  So far High school sophomore year was the best time of my life  and now things kinda suck lol I always told myself I'd never do anything rash or stupid while in an emotional state  emotion clouds your judgement  I can look back on times I've 1000  wanted to die but now I'm kind of glad I didn't Awful  Two grandparents and my family dog of twelve years died  My self esteem has sunk lower and lower and I've further isolated myself from the rest of the world by maintaining as few friendships and relationships as possible because my perception of myself is so distorted that I don't find myself worthy of them   A lot of Hollywood Undead songs  Bullet  Pain  Hear Me Now  Black Dahlia to name a few    Edit  genre is rock  Sort of  Yo imo anyone can make friends anyone even you  She just cares about you but has trouble saying it  Like why arnt u enjoying urself with friends etc      She just wants to know why ur not enjoying urself but like me u dont know  Dont be too hard on her she just wants the best  Holy guacamole  This is the best explanation I have come across so far  Thanks a lot for the link  I really thought everyone once in a while thinks about murdering people  Like not in a 'I really want to kill XYZ  because XYZ is stupid' but more in a 'What would happen if I pushed XYZ in front of a car '  And sometimes it really itches in my fingers to just do it  but obviously I don't do it   ain't nobody got time to go to jail   Thanks for the link again   Happy new years  Hey at least you have a friend to celebrate with  Mine all moved away  My ex cheated on me this last year and she was my everything for years and years    Maybe this will help you  in the next year i hope to find a person to hangout with  I dont care if we pick each others noses  kidding  Just know that i had the worst year imaginable and that you are lucky to have another person to even talk too    But i am feeling optimistic about this coming year  I hope that i find someone that i can make happy enough to reply to my texts or hangout with and do whatever  Im going to do what ever i can to make even 1 friend     Sometimes if u step back and look at it from someone elses perspective it helps you feel better  I hope i have helped even a little bit    Good for you     not sarcasm  me too Fuck  I am so miserable right now  I feel like I'm cursed to be alone  Does it get better  I got some good things coming up in the next few weeks but I'm worried it won't be enough  I'm tired of being me  What a handsome little guy  Happy new year to him aswell Glad it helped Geez  that was a bad one  I'm usually anxious but sometimes i think myself into a bad depression  this was one of them  Im better now  I guess i just needed a little pick me up  Im fine now  but anxiety will probably set in soon  that or ill go into another depression  Thank you so much for your willingness to talk though  you don't know how much that means to me   I listen to 9   5  by Dolly parton  It always cheers me up for some reason  Cheesy harmless song Yes  Very much so   Everything can happen  either good or bad  2017 has only started  calm down and think positively  It seels like you can't be honest even with a stranger over internet  Its fine tho  If you find strenght  you can always write a wall of text in my inbox  I WILL read it and answer  What stops you from being yourself   I'm 14 and I'm already stupid reckless drinking to numb pain and overall Suicidal as fuck I can get loans and stuff but going out of state in America can add a lot of money to tuition and housing and such  can get up to about a  20 000 difference or sometimes more   Im getting scholarships and in state tuition where im going  but it will still cost a lot once i start to pay off the loan  The field im going into wont pay out much in the beginning  which will result in a lot more work on my end to pay everything off  Thats why my family puts a while lot of pressure on me to get more scholarships     at least I'm not the only one   How do you keep going  I kinda have to be  or at least believe it  I need some motivation  There can be right and wrong without the existence of God   That guy is cool  xD Do everything u can to make him happy  He'll appreciate it Feeling really alone recently  My birthday was the 23rd and a depressive episode kicked in as I woke up  I'm trying to get myself out of it but it feels kind of pointless  My fiance is in Chicago with her best friend and sisters right now while I'm in our hometown with my parents   I don't know  I'm just really hoping this new year changes things for me   but with the current state that seems unlikely  but I'm trying to be positive  and right now I know that's all I can do  I'm looking for cheap therapy nearby as I just got new health insurance  so hopefully  hopefully I'll get better  Social phobia  i'd like to join them but i think so little of myself in a social setting that i dont even try to engage with them   Lots of dealerships have somewhere between a 24 hour and 7 day "changed you mind" policy  If you honestly can't afford it and didn't pay the debt off I'd plead with them to take it back   Yes  that is what I tell myself  I should rephrase it  I can't be sure of right or wrong without an absolute answer  God being an example  Not that complicated of a problem  but still ruining my life haha Worth going to urgent care  Being dead would suck   I know exactly how you feel   Lost my mom in February this year  and also blame myself   For that and other reasons  sleep is literally the best part of my day   I have    contemplated death   And like you  I remember the ones who need me   even if I have nothing else to contribute to their lives but my presence   Most of the time words are a hollow comfort  but my mom used to say  "You can't fall out of a ditch" when I was down   And I would remind her that "at least we have noses "  I mean really  without them  we'd all be walking around looking like Voldemort with no olfactory sensation     I guess I mean to say that I feel the same sense of desolation   The feeling that nothing will ever get better   But I have to believe it will  and look for the small hopes and happy moments and silly  stupid humor     Those moments are few and far between  but I think our moms would want to see us smile   I hope you can find a smile  my thoughts are with you     Hey  hit me here or inbox or Steam  same name   I am sure we can play together and you can talk to me if you want  I am a complete stranger after all  right  It WILL make you feel better and you may even get some advices in return  win win kind of situation   This has to be the weirdest year of my life  It got really bad in the last few weeks  I just want this year to be over  I'm alone and miserable  Things are happening for the better and I hope to use that momentum to try to be finally happy  I hope you guys have a happy new year  There is hope for all of us  I know it  We're all kinda in hell at the moment  this plane of existence is quite painful  we're all coping in our own ways  be it with delusions  drugs  cigarettes  violence  bullying    Etc  Etc  We're all in pain   I don't care if my dad is happy  he's being irresponsible  I should add that at times  he'd ask for my mum for money  and my mum earns very little  less than  500 a month   I don't really hate my job  in fact  I quite like it  except for a few tasks and 'work hazards'  fucking fire ants and the blazing sun  that really turns me off   What do you mean by 'I don't care'  Also depression for a year and counting One day at a time friend  one day at a time  I play games and watch series movies  You just gotta find things that pass time fast  kind of  Even if you're not going to enjoy them particularly much   Doesn't matter about genre  But NF Is straight to the point he's a rapper and Saywecanfly is good too  But  he's a soft singer Hey bud  life throws stones at you  your job is to fight back and never give up  also  just remember that you have survived every single bad day so far  If you're new on reddit  check out  r getmotivated and  r books   Then what's the point of r depression if we cannot look out for each other   I'm defeated only 6 hours until new year's and 2017 will still  Ake me Depressed  Happy new year  Hey a supermarket isn't a bad job  You can get promotions fairly easily  I used to work at one for 3 years  I feel the same way  Everyday feels like its exactly the same to me  I am a robot wandering about this earth  But trust me hard work pays off   You seem like you have the weight of the world on your shoulders  Just take a deep breathe and relax  Who cares if your a virgin  So what  Would you rather have an STD  My point is just dont be so hard on yourself  Everyone your age has barely started adulthood  What i mean by that is take the most promiscuous person from high school and how many times do you think they have had sex    not as many times as you think    Just take a deep breath  I'm 25 and sometimes still think like "why bother with life  I'd rather be dead" but you know what  I'm going to keep trying  When you start to focus on your own death at such a young age people dont want to hangout with you  They are at the age where they are enjoying and living life    I've been there before trust me  Please dont let the years go by  Before you know it you'll be my age saying " damn i should have done this or that" Don't keep looking at the past all the time  Don't stress about what the future has to bring whatever happens happens and you have to live in the present    Its a very hard confusing time in your life trust me i know  But all the parties and shit wont mean anything in a few years  Really what are u missing out on  Drunk high people screaming at each other and backstabbing each other   Maybe focus on like school or something before its too late  Im just now getting back into school because it was like every year something would come up i had to deal with  Just make a plan and reach for the sky   Yep  I agree with you  Everything about my life gets worse by the minute  The world seems to do the same   Hey there  I appreciate your devil may care attitude  but here's the thing  I'm not sure what I'd do if I were to quit now  not sure what kind of job I'd take up  I can't picture myself having a long lasting career    I'm too undecided to stay rooted  I've considered being a librarian or a diver  but the former might require me to cut my hair  and the latter needs some courses and a certificate  not to mention it's quite the travel from my house to the workplace   Drunk huh  I rarely drink    I hope you're having a good time  and yes  Happy New Year  Happy new year to you and your sweet little friend there  I know what it means to have a special relationship with your dog     May the new year bring you both great things    Edited for spelling typo   2017 launching a preemptive strike at my will to live I don't know what to say  If she hated you so much she'd of kicked you out  imo  She just nagging getting on at you because she cares  She doesnt want u living with a old person thats all  she wants u living with some 21 year old girl etc    she doesnt just know how to say it because shes upset for u True  it's celebrated all around the world and everyone is with loved ones or friends  the whole thing is way more present tgan vd Ditto  Broken record for the past 15 years now  Is there an option to maybe snug a person for you out of a big party  Or maybe you can wait untill some of them leave  Or maybe you can take a walk with someone to their home  Hitting a brick wall with your head  by overthinking all those problems can't help you  right      Last time i was in the situation like you i was   washing dishes after everyone  Kitchen was near so i was listening to everything they say  i WAS with them  in a way      Maybe you can snug a glass of something  find a comfy chair and just sit somewhere not far  listen to them and watch the sky or fireworks      I'm sory but i have to go to sleep  its 05 00 for me and i need to be at work tomorrow 16 00 and i have some housework for tomorrow too      I wish you the best  Don't hit that wall  put a chair next to it  or look for a window or a backdoor  Metaphors  Okay  I'm glad you have found this prospect of happiness  You CAN be happy  and you deserve it  Keep thinking along these lines  Happy new year  Makes me worse  somehow  YMMV   Are you me  Sounds awesome  I've been wanting to drive my own car for severeal months now but I still can't afford one  Damn  Doesn't matter if it's a new year    By the time it's 12 01 you're will to live will still be shattered with Depression This is my 6th consecutive year being home alone  It's not that I don't have options  my anxiety won't let me out   Plus I just don't see the point in many things anymore  It's all I can think of  It not the nicest mix is it  hope you can continue to get through it My depression has responded best to the following  out of the tens of meds  combos I've tried  Ritalin  Abilify  Kratom  Oxycodone  Provigil  I have 'atypical' depression FWIW  Naturally  don't start the Oxy unless you have to   I wish I could tell you that it does  but in my experience that would be a lie  Sorry to say  Naturally  I can't speak for you  though  Who knows  maybe you'll feel better in a week  But for me it's hard to find meaning in anything  There is not a single thing that I want in life  Nothing matters  I guess the one thing I want is a quick and peaceful death  Either that  or happiness  but the latter seems rather unlikely  Sorry if I sound too negative  I don't want to further discourage you   I guess that's it  We  have  to believe that it will   Thank you for sharing this  I relate so much with what you've said   And with a HP reference  to top it off  Haha   Let's continue living for those moments  kind stranger     Another year to endure  Many of us won't make it   Yep  It does zip for me now  even after weeks of abstinence  Bummer   It's okay  thanks for the honesty      2 comments are shadow banned   Edit  3 comments shadow banned for some reason  Maybe I'm shadow banned and that's why I can't see these comments  Hmmm    Forgive me but how can the election bother you this much  I doubt your life on a day to day basis will change much at all   Number 3 is so fucking true  I know I would have these problems whether I was with someone or not  but what's wrong with having someone who truly loves you  in spite  of your problems  It's better than not having that  I made it outside today too  just barely  Even if for a few hours sitting on my laptop in a coffee shop  watching everyone converse with others  NYE is my most hated holiday of the entire year  and it never fails to disappoint  You'd think a person would be used to it at this point  I still have  6 hours left  but always end up knocking out well before midnight  I just now discovered tonight was New Year's Eve after googling hours for a restaurant  I normally don't do anything for New Years but was thinking about going out tomorrow  Oh well  maybe next year haha   Happy new year  fellow human As 17 year old  I've been through some bad spots  Talk to someone  It's the most important step  It's bad now  If you can survive this you can survive the next thing  Same thing happened to me tonight  All of my friends are with their SO's  I'm eating a gun tomorrow  Hopefully then they'll all get the hint that I was suffering  Okay im going to be a little hard on you alright  Don't hate me    I'm 25 and dated a girl for ten years  since high school  and she cheated on me   The f    d up part is she chested on me while i was visiting her own grandfather by myself in the hospital a day before he died   Some girls just do not f     I paid her rent  helped her with her mother's death  funeral   and gave this girl everything  She was the only girl i looked at  So you can take it from me when i say that this woman is playing you    If you stepped up for her vhild when it wasnt yours that makes you a fantastic guy  really it does man  I dont want you to think im knocking you for that  But now she see's she has an income babysitter and she thinks she can do whatever she wants  Just like my girl " oh hes at the hospital with my papa so i dont need to worry about that today  Hmm what should i do to pass the tine" you get what i mean    You seem like me  one of the good guys  This world has certain types of female that prey on guys like us  They can't make up their f       mind on which flavor of ice cream they want so they just try all of them  I dont know the entire story obviously   Dont let her string you along man  Do you want to spend your whole life wondering if shes f       another dude when your not around    Sure i mean you have kids involved and you can act civil towards each other but she seems like she doesnt know what she wants unless its you to be around as the dad    My advice is be the best damn dad u can be bro   i dont have kids  if it were me  i would find another girl even if it takes a while  Kids get attached to whoever u bring home so make sure u dont have like a different girl everynight you know just find a good girl who doesnt mess with you head and give u mixed signals like this one does  They do exist  the good guys like u n me have just got to find them   I'm with OP  Gunna start this year off right with a quality suicide attempt  Hopefully it works   The reason for not allowing advertising yourself as a helper is that it's a slap in the face to the OPs who've poured their hearts out and asked for help   There are always people who have not received enough good responses   why not reply to them   The reason for not allowing helpers to invite PMs as a first resort is that there's no reason for someone who's legitimately here to help to avoid scrutiny of their comments by the community      I want to blow my brains out at a house party in front of all my "friends"   Man  I wish it were persistently effective for me   Thank you for your feedback  I'm taking this day by day  hopefully a visit to the psychiatrist will help or at least give me some answers  Goddamn this speaks to me really hard    The first time I took Provigil I started putting in 15 hour work days out of the blue     YMMV of course  but just saying  Now it has no discernable effect   That sucks   But why did she send you pictures  Keep your heads up though  today a new  365 pages long story starts and you're just about to write the beginning     Love the attitude man  I feel the same way  today is just another day  why dwell on it and be sad when there's PLENTY of other people that aren't doing anything on NYE as well  I'm going to enjoy this 3 day weekend and look ahead to the future  Happy New Year to you  your brother and everyone you care about  Agreed    Hope so too   Just remember that it can take time to get meds straightened out so as cliche as it may sound  patience is key  I get you  I tried to reach out to my parents telling them how I didn't want to live in 2017  My mother's response  She went on to tell me about how she had just programmed the DVD player and ignored my confessing that I planned to kill myself   I was thinking this a lot yesterday  What the actual fuck goes on inside us  Why do our brains want us to suffer  It doesn't make any fucking sense  Mental illness really sucks and I wish it would all just fuck off for everyone  So many people crippled by mental illness are often the kindest  smartest  most creative and generous people out there  and it's so saddening that this kind of shit happens to them  I hope some day in the future there will be something to permanently rid someone of mental illness    I hope everyone has a better year and more luck in fighting your problems in 2017  2016 was goddamn hell buy I believe in all of you that y'all can beat this shit  Your posts have been absolutely beautiful  thank you  Shit  I'm so sorry about that      I'm in a similar boat  Alone on New Years  It's fucking depressing  and I'm seriously considering drinking a fuck load just to rid these emotions    And I've actually never been drunk before   Whilst I don't know if you're serious or not I wish you all the best  no matter which way you choose    Sound advice  but im not even overthinking things  im just in a permanent stage of feeling like shit  and whenever i try to fake feeling good or try engaging myself  even if i can do it for a little bit  it doesnt make me feel like ive achieved anything and i just go back to my original state Cheers to yet another year    No  c please don't  We have no clue what's in store for 2017  And no one knows what can happen in your life  Maybe you'll make new friends  find a partner  start the right med  have a great experience  discover interests of yours  Please give 2017 a chance  maybe it will make up for the shit of 2016 by being the best year in a while   Please post to  r SuicideWatch and read the side bar if you are considering suicide  Also I'd urge you to call a crisis line  they are amazing and kind people  and they don't judge  People care and your life has so much value  Please stay alive I totally feel you man  I wish I had some live in my life   I can just hope the best for 2017  U You sound a lot like me minus the job part but my job isn't really special  Hopefully 2017 will change our luck  I have so much resentment and jealousy of my older brother  it has taken a toll in our relationship and we've become kind of distant and estranged  He has his life together  is physically fit and knows how to act like a proper adult  And then there's me  a 13 year old girl stuck in the body of a 20 year old man child  For many of us  life is just one never ending bad day  Every next day day the same as the last   Thank you     Im sorry to hear that   merry late christmas to you too and happy new year  Lets hope that 2017 will be better     I use to watch videos all the time  but then again I'm realizing it's just pointless and a waste of time   Unfortunately there's nothing else for me to do   So yeah Ya know I've heard tell of fellas goin off grid  Travelling in search of somethin  We're all searchin for somethin man  For some it's numbers  Others  Well I figure they like words most  Then still others find somethin beautiful in plumbing  I'm figuring on heading out myself  No idea what I'm lookin for either so you ain't alone  Maybe we're lookin for nothin in particular  We're the few  but that just makes us the wild cards ya know   Hm I guess I can be lucky not to have a sister  especially a sister asking such hurtful questions  u Seriously  its like our brains embraces them  it doesnt make any sense  Most mental illnesses fuck with your life in many ways  why dont we have some kind of defense mechanism against this  Home alone on New Years  Blast your favourite music  eat your favourite foods  find chat rooms  and do things you like  such as hobbies  It can still be a good night even if you don't have anyone  Make the most of it  And believe me  the things I recommended can help a ton  That's just a very responsible doctor keeping tabs on your son since that is a very high dose  The standard "top" range is 30mg but it doesn't mean that you overdose at doses higher than that  I was on a dose higher than 30mg for a while  Even when I was at 15mg and 20mg my psychiatrist had me in for periodic EKG's just to check things out  Many psych medications can have cardiac implications  it's just kind of the risk many of them have  The class that abilify is in is known for having a small risk of an abnormal rhythm  an abnormal ECG  and sudden low blood pressure when standing up  Those symptoms are not generally super serious but it has caused the medical community to be considerably more cautious about other potential cardiovascular issues that could be present  especially in someone who may not be aware of any underlying issues    It sounds very much like your son's doctor is being responsible  There is no such thing as a "no risk" psych med  There is no "Tylenol" of the psych world  Some antidepressants are fairly benign and have few side effects and people can go about fairly normally with them  Any other class of med in the psychiatric world comes with risk and side effects that are somewhat unpleasant  Usually the illness they are treating is more unpleasant and so we take the meds  Abilify is honestly one of the more tolerable of the bunch  They sort of start getting less desirable from there   Yes I'm bored I have a headache Thank you  I appreciate the kind words That's me Snapchat is worse  Yet I still click through each and every story of people having a good time   OP you're probably a really chill person and I hope you have a better day tomorrow than you did tonight    If you're in upstate NY you can smoke pot with us I'm doing alright  What about you  What a positive post under all the negative ones   Happy new year everyone  For me music is one of those things that can make me feel a little  usually because the song in some small sense can describe how i feel  most of the time i feel pretty numb   I couldn't have said it better man    I kinda don't get it either   Haha my problems arn't as bad as yours but yeah my bestfriend left me for a guy  I was there when she needed me but when she got a bf i was second best never there for me  Still hurts and I feel shitty btw dont want to compare just sharing my story    haha If you want someone to talk to just message me  I like talking to people that are struggling like me hopefully ur year changes around or else    jk haha With number 4 I honestly stopped giving a shit  Surprisingly I am decent at talking to others but I will never approach them  I simply don't feel like it  Instead I choose to spend my time reading things or daydreaming to my music  I figure like either my pills will make me feel better enough to  want  to talk to others or I'll be alone for a long time  cope as best I can  maybe suicide  I honestly feel as if I don't really care since my days may be numbered  More importantly though  I enjoy not forcing myself to do anything I don't want to do  OP is on Long island     Thanks for the offer  r raisedbynarcissists    What assbags threaten to throw out their sons' things goddamn  I haven't heard of TMS  but I will look into it now  But yeah those side effects sound pretty drastic  and with a lack of permanence  sounds pretty terrible   I feel you  I guess my life is even worse than yours  but I don't have any real "friends" either  It sucks and much of the stuff I do is just pointless and a waste of time  I don't know what 2017 will bring but I guess I have to keep my head up   It really sucks losing a best friend    Hang in there mate  You should really consider talking about this with people  Maybe reconnect with your friends  I find that whenever I'm feeling really dark and gloomy  talking about it always helps  Therapy is helpful  if you get a therapist you connect with  I noticed but just did what I do every day  ignoring the fireworks outside   you're the first person in this thread to comment on my writing  thank you No wins for me  My crippling anxiety and depression worsened  I have suicidal ideation weekly now  I go to bed each night picturing what the people around me will think when I die  Thinking about 2017 makes me want to vomit  I have to drop out of college soon too   Haha your  just shy no need to be ashamed he probably finds it cute as fuck  One day you'll find the courage  Plus if he really likes you  He wont mind waiting so you know he's a keeper    You'll kiss when your comfortable no need to rush it  Good Luck I believe in you  Caffeine is definitely one of my go tos  But I also take Effexor  damn though they are throwing everything at you  has it been helping     Thank you      Happy new year  Reword Drugs with Alcohol and thats me xD Your not alone btw m8  Thanks I feel for you so much  At the beginning of this year a group that I had trusted and thought of as friends all turned their back on me  Now the one person I thought I had left to trust now is off celebrating with them  I know it's petty jealousy but being alone sucks   I feel it  just tried to spend some time with the folks  dad got offended by how I smoke my cig  near violence ensued  had to leave  Haha I feel the same as you  Listen to NF Paralyzed  I think this should describe you  What chat rooms  Yup pretty much this I hope you can change your perspective  We all have our ups and downs but what makes life beautiful is that we have Both  There's a lot of good in this world and I wish you the best in finding it  I know it's a battle  You can do it   Yeah but seeing all those Snapchat stories of people having fun sucks  u Speak to your parents buddy   Approximately 9 hours ago  I was feeling very  very down and suicidal  about total misunderstandings and misreading things that were said happened over Christmas  I was racking my brain for hours  how I was going to ask my brother about those things that had been plaguing me since then  I got it into my head that my brother would kick off on the phone  saying something like "how dare you think of us like that "  He caught me off guard whilst I was planning what to say  and he phoned me  so just said what I had to say  but asked him not to be angry before hand  I also explained that what I had to ask him may seem trivial even stupid   You know what buddy   It turns out that neither him  his wife or their son meant the things that I though they had  with the way they looked at me when I said whatever  or what they meant when they said whatever   And I'm 44  and it's still very difficult for me  But don't let that make you think that it's all gonna be bad  even by my age  Chances are it won't  Hang in there and tell your parents   I have Asperger's  and so  social situations are extremely difficult for me   In the end  all was sorted  I apologised  and we said "happy New Year" to each other  and with that said  that saw the end of 2016   Don't worry about a phone  I know you don't know me  but I have shit loads of spare phones if you want one  You matter  not material objects  They  in time can be replaced  you can't  That's terrible  certainly not worthy of best friend title  You deserve better OP   Happy new year buddy  Man   life sucks  it's true   but we've managed to endure it   and I'm content if I have to suffer for the remainder of time I am here  them let it be  even if everything might get worse  I still know we are far stronger than others  feath will do us apart either way  even if this demise is permanent  I can't change your or my destiny and I know this text wont do shit about it  there's still the possibility shit can work out  it might wont  but fuck it  what if it works out  Life is a shit hole  but will it be for the remainder  Even if it is the smallest of chances  I think we can live for a few more moments  Trying not to weigh too heavy on my SO  She's so supportive  but she doesn't deserve to put up with me every day  so I'm attempting to make conversation on r baseball and take my mind off things  It's going meh   Life sucks  I go on impulse buying sprees which i always regret and end up getting refunds for  essentially wasting time  and everything is just shit  My family is disappointed in me  and I have no idea what I want to do with my life  I have no passion or drive to do anything that would sustain a healthy living  I want to fucking die  but I'm too much of a coward to do it   I feel for you buddy  I'm a recovered alcoholic  It does get easier  Just drifting in this turbulent sea called life  oh so weary of everything  drenched  tired  starving  pointless   Wild cards eh  I always loved wild card characters  no obligations to alliance  mostly lone rangers  probably weirdos  Yeah I agree with what your saying  I guess I'm stuck on her because we have two kids together and so much history  I've done so much for her from getting her any car she wanted cash in hand along with a house that she picked out and putting food on the table along with a roof over our heads  I know she wants me back I really do but like you said with the ice cream she doesn't know what flavor she wants  Its hard on me because I have no family they are back in Jersey and I'm in Texas and to top it off with a bang my mom passed away on new years day of 09 and its gonna be a tough on tonight  Ill take your word for it bro but its hard to cope with this problem then she wants to fuck me and tell me how she feels and then next day back with the other dude that she said she loves   You cant love some one that damn quick  But hey she's kinda fucked in the head  I made a mistake that I cant take back I wished the worst on her and came back she has some type of cancer and I feel so bad now  I hate being such a nice guy and getting treated like shit  why cant girls respect men like us  Wow this song is perfect for me honestly thanks man  i still feel so nervous every time i post something on this website i never know what im saying is right  but every time i get a response it gives me a little hope Happy for you buddy  Have a good time and  happy new year  Omg me too  I want to hang myself or cut myself at a party I'm not so far down yet  but even if nothing works out  I'll embrace the crap life throws at me  for I will at least die knowing I've tried everything till my last breath  I'll be crying in 5 hours too I'm alone too     I'm finally in a loving relationship and trust me my depression isn't any better   At least the delivery man didn't let me down  '  Music never fails to comfort me when I'm down  Well think of it this way  you're just gonna ruin it one way or another so might as well make it quick  No  your grammar is actually better than most native English speakers on the internet  Also  yes  this is probably a period of depression  I'm dependent on the government for living needs  I am unable to work or go to school presently  and it's likely to be permanent disability  So if there's a giant change to medicare or otherwise  I won't be able to afford my medication which is what keeps me from hearing voices and being intensely depressed as often  I'm scared of the sounds coming back  the psychosis    I know it's not real but it's scary and I don't want to be in that place again  Calm seas never made a skillful sailor    stay hungry my man Take a nap  smoke a bowl  maybe even go workout or something    Do whatever you can to be some sort of busy    People suck and the can easily be replaced    Image Time  Reality  If you want to not be depressed do what you see not depressed people do   It'll feel fake and unvoluntary at first but that's natural    I'm not an expert at this but keeping yourself busy in some way or another is super important to your well being in there situations    You can PM me if you want someone to talk to  definitely would be interested  add me as Padalock 1521 on battle net or Padalock 1358 on Discord    Blink182 Adam's Song  I hide the ropes and knives whenever I play the song though  There's also the trauma aspect to it  which is that my abusive father talked a lot like him  and I can easily get PTSD issues just hearing that voice  So it's hard for me to feel remotely safe when you have someone who's so close to my abuser  in power   In this case a pres instead of a cop and dad though  I just    don't feel safe and haven't felt safe since then  and because of the hate crimes  I might not be black or otherwise  but I'm afraid of what people would do if they knew I was disabled and autistic  I want to feel stable  and safe again  But if this is the wrong place to vent about something I'm deeply terrified of  then I'm sorry  Please don't mate  I was feeling the exact same way in June last year  I now am thankful that I didn't do it  Thank you    Hope it is better for you Yo there is no right or wrong answer when you post on here  Imo its just to blow some anger or how you feel  Just say what u want no ones going to judge u on this subreddit because everyone feels shitty  And if they do there just a troll  The way I see it is  if someone doesn't have my phone number or I didn't contact them before leaving to set up another means of contact   we weren't talking often enough to be tight friends anyways   You have no room in your life for acquaintances  you're so much better  And just listening for me makes me feel even worse  unless im directly involved i can get no joy out of it I hope you don't mate  I'm a recovered alcoholic  I was feeling suicidal six months ago  and I'm glad I didn't do it  add here Memories of my Grandma  Yeah  she's loving and caring  Makes me smile every time  then cry  Happy New Year to you both  so cute You're in an abusive relationship with it  it hurts you but you keep going back  You are above it  it's not easy to let go but you'll feel so much freer  I wish I could spend it in a mental hospital but I'm just not ready to reavel my Depression until the 3rd Happy New Year mate  From UK I can only imagine  I think that you're really right that all of our "existential crises" don't mean that we can't be happy  Maybe life's meaningless   maybe there's no God   maybe nothing is right or wrong   maybe all of those things are true  But that doesn't mean that we can't be happy  and find a way to enjoy the time that we have  Of course  that can be hard too  but I'd like to think it really is possible for us  all the same   Happy 2017 to you too  and thanks for the words of encouragement  Would you like to come to a New Years Eve party in a virtual world  It's free and everyone is welcome   Just come to inworldz com   Don't do

drank  I'm here for you all I was suicidal as a teenager as well  Life gets better as you get older though    Is therapy an option  Is there anyone you can talk to    Are you open to calling a hotline    Hang in there  You're only 13  life will get better   Wow Well nihilism helped me with my depression  so maybe you're on the right track  Depends on what your definition of  "success" is  In a loud ass bar  Lonely as fuck   I've always been thin  but this past year I've put on loads of weight  Plan on loosing it this year Do you trust your parents   I understand what you mean   Like after school grades arent even gonna matter so like why am i wasting my time on trying  The only reason i get good grades is because i have so much pressure on me from everyone to do well in school  And im sorry that things are bad for you right now  And yeah  hopefully 2017 is better  even if only a tiny bit  Don't do anything bad please  Pm me  I've chronic anxiety  recurrent depression  current episode severe  with psychotic symptoms  PTSD and Asperger's   Oh  I'm a recovered alcoholic too  3 years since I last drank   I was feeling the same way six months ago  and I'm glad I didn't  I'm 44 and only had sex once  and that was with a prostitute 25 years ago  I know what you mean  Alternative  Deaf Havana   Anemophobia  One of my favourites  Do it slowly  Like a gradual thing  Do you hug and kiss him on the check regularly  If you already do these things  then you should see a kiss on the lips as a natural step  It doesn't have to be a french kiss or something challenging like that  Try to see intimacy as a gradual thing   Thanks  and you too You said it better than I could  It makes me smile to see that I could encourage at least one person  Have a happy 2017 I wont right now  but Idk how much I can take  Just chillin with the dog on the couch drinking lime a ritas   Really sucks that I have no friends   Trying hard not to get down about it      Social media doesn't help  that's for sure  We didn't  Others had to break down the egg or something like that  We were just lucky enough   or unlucky enough to make it in Worst feeling Dude  you gotta play Silent Hill 2  I haven't seen the movie  but the game was the most psychological experience I've had from literature Have a good time  Happy New Year  I'm 44 and not successful in the traditional sense  couldn't finish Physics degree due to alcoholism  was doing extremely well though  I have been successful in teaching myself everything I know about Computer Since  I'm also extremely good at what I do in IT   So don't let bad grades etc put you off  I've had some extremely useful and life saving advice by many genuine really nice and sincere people on Reddit  Your family sounds like they treat you like shit  They don't seem to like the idea of you standing up to anyone or having confidence  Who cares if people on the internet are helping to boost your confidence  shouldn't they be happy for you  No offense  but what a bunch of cunts  I did the exact same thing  twice a few months ago  And I'm glad now that I didn't go through with it  Same here     You should tell them that you are an adult who can make their own decisions  and you are hurt they they are not there to support you  If they continue this type of behavior I would say to spend less and less time around them   I always get my hopes up that things will be better  But then quickly come back down to reality  The only thing we can count on are that things will remain awful  "Be yourself "  "Quit being so negative "  pick one I've called them texted them many  many times  and they've always been very  very helpful  Saved my life on many occasions   Exceptional experience all round  Just stop giving a fuck about being alone  I just accepted and now it's normal and it doesn't really hurt anymore Good job on putting yourself out there  Happy new year   Felt the same way too Happy new year    You're shooting yourself in the foot saying 2017 isn't going to be good when not even the whole world is on Jan 1 yet    You say you'll be disappointed with all that you won't accomplish then go on to say you're just going to do nothing and waste time  How can you be disappointed when you give absolutely zero effort  Disappointment is reserved for actual let downs  not things that don't miraculously go well    Yes  you can't just push your depression aside and kick ass like no one's business  but you have to try  something   Depression wants you to do nothing because that's what it feeds on  and the longer you sit and sulk  the worse it'll get    You need to reveal your worth to yourself  You have potential  don't waste it telling yourself it's not enough  People will tell you time and time again that you're worth it  but it's not this depressed version that has worth  The person you  could  be if you set every fiber of your being on 'Go' is worth it  You  can  do great things  but you need to see that you're capable   I hope the first part of my message didn't put you off  I know what's it like to be depressed beyond belief  but imo the worst thing I  or anyone  could do is feel sorry for you   In the hospital  Suffer from several chronic illnesses and have spent the whole year here  Only 22 years old  graduated from college a year ago and haven't done anything since  I was a model  a news anchor  a girlfriend  an aunt  a sister  daughter  friend  and now i'm none of those things  besides a sister   aunt  but i never see them   I'll be dead in 2017 due to my illnesses  If you're home alone count your blessings   Dennis  Why don't we start over  How many of my dresses would you like to order   Fatty Magoo  None  Not one   Dennis  Okay  well I'm not going to take no for an answer because I just refuse to do that because I'm a winner and winners    we don't listen to words like "no" or "don't" or "stop " Those words are just not in our vocabulary  I know what you need  You need to see my dresses on a model  I'll tell you what  I'm going to come back tomorrow with a model   Fatty Magoo  Please don't do that   Dennis  Save your breath  Ingrid  Those words have never worked on me  I'll see you tomorrow  So sooty for your loss mate  I still grieve after my dad whom died 28 years ago That should have read "so sorry for your loss" Believe in yourself  you can make it through I know how you feel  I often feel that way to  I feel like whenever I say something that I think is important to me concerning  people seem to chalk it up to my depression or my anxiety  It's very frustrating  I'm sorry that they make you feel that way too  I know it's not much  but if it's any consolation you're not alone 3  Do they know that you are depressed   do what i do just slack off and itll be better That sucks man  but i don't know if this is our area of expertise  You might want to post on r relationships Exactly  For the brain of the "smartest" mammal on earth  youd think it would know to produce the right chemicals when needed and actually fight off or counteract mental illness  You should celebrate that you no longer are bound to a hoe    Find a pretty girl tonight and kiss her  I did on a previous note which I had anxiety over previous experiences about exes going to a party and them cheating on me  I trusted her and loved her and I'm pretty hurt  My mother repeatedly said that she didn't want me as a child  and that I'm a "Devil child "  I was very severely bullied  physically and verbally due to being mixed race   I've chronic anxiety  recurrent depression  current

my parrents write off what I'm saying quite often   My sister has 3 diagnoses on psychological issues  and my other sister is going nowhere  mainly because of her own stupidity   They rely on me to be the sucessfull one  often telling me that I have no reason for being sad  and I have everything  while my sisters have nothing   No one really listened when I lost my to be wife  and after that  things just fucked me over all of the time    I hope that you know someone to talk with  because I've never had much luck explaining it to mine Win  Built my computer  didn't kill myself   Loss  Everything else So what haven't you tried yet in life  You should try that in 2017  I am right there with you  Sitting here watching Netflix  I wish I were alone but I live with my parents and they kept asking me about my plans earlier  They always judge me for "being anti social" and staying home all the time  But change it isn't as easy as they make it out to be  None of my "friends" contacted me about NYE plans and that makes me feel pretty shitty but I guess it really isn't the end of the world  Hope you have a great new year   yup its awful nothing will change it seems  Yes  I wish  I wish so bad I could just go No Contact for a few weeks   I'm sorry   It's not your fault bud but I do appreciate it  im gonna do it tbh  its gotten to that point sadly     What a meme band   You know  You're kinda right  Fuck it you're only alive once in your life so live it up  Thanks mate  I won't pretend to know exactly how you feel  but I was suicidal 6 months ago  and now am glad I didn't do it  I now know that it would really effect my brother  nephew and mother   I've said for years that I'd do it some day  but now am glad I didn't  Hey I feel this whole post  PM if you need to talk     Any  There are millions all over the internet  Discord is becoming a big one  and has some amazing communities  Check out various chatting subs and ones that are interests of yours    I think as long as you're not neglecting your responsibilities and you don't do it too long a few days by yourself completely might be a good reboot   Don't do anything bad please  Pm me  I've chronic anxiety  recurrent depression  current episode severe  with psychotic symptoms  PTSD and Asperger's   Oh  I'm a recovered alcoholic too  3 years since I last drank  absolutely I will be doing productive things instead  Thanks for the help  I'm on Sertraline  Mirtazepine and Olanzepine  All work for me I'm not saying you're doing this  but just see if the following rings true   If your understanding of exercise  currently  only encompasses certain kinds of activities  or certain intensities  especially grueling workouts   you might think all exercise feels really bad  A lot of new exercisers jump in with good expectations but end up doing too much too soon  and it hurts  It's sweaty and uncomfortable and then you're sore the next day  Why does anyone like feeling like that    Because if you stick with it  and or  if you alter your definition of exercise to include lower intensity activities  https   www researchgate net publication 51513210 The Pleasure and Displeasure People Feel When they Exercise at Different Intensities Decennial Update and Progress towards a Tripartite Rationale for Exercise Intensity Prescription   it starts feeling good for almost everyone  Maybe not during the time you're exercising  but that's okay  Exercise in different forms is a pleasure for some people and a chore for others  But I firmly believe that  exercise is a necessary component of good mental and physical health     It saddens me that a lot of people don't exercise because they think exercise only means one thing  and they don't like that one thing  usually that thing is the gym   I always tell my patients to pick a lower intensity activity if they are having trouble with exercise adherence  If running means pain and sweat and breathlessness to you  why not try walking instead  If lifting weights is not your cup of tea  could you commit to home bodyweight exercises  Or home yoga videos  Do you enjoy a hobby that you might not have previously considered to be exercise  like gardening  The light exercise you will do is always better than the vigorous exercise you won't    I would really encourage you to try making a habit of any kind of daily activity that seems doable to you  It can sound daunting  but it doesn't have to be   somehow I am unsure if I keep going because I'm stupid   But I never wanna be skilled  I just wanna sleep  That's bad  Ignore them My year was ok until a few weeks ago  I am really depressed right now  I just want this year to be over  I need a fresh start  I'm not sure if you're kidding or not  Could you tell me more about what you mean  Same here  Thought I would be able to make some sort of plans to go out tonight but literally none of my friends have even texted me in over a week  I just feel so lonely and forgotten  It sucks that if I don't initiate contact then we don't talk    I feel like I don't have any will to go into 2017  I constantly hope for change and no matter how hard I work to make it happen  shitty things just keep on happening     Could you name a few   Don't do anything bad please  Pm me  I've chronic anxiety  recurrent depression  current episode severe  with psychotic symptoms  PTSD and Asperger's   Oh  I'm a recovered alcoholic too  3 years since I last drank  You never know how fast things can turn around  This time last year I was miserable and today I'm happier than I've ever been  Keep up hope    Which band  Glad it worked for you long term  It seemed to stop working for me  though my powder has been exposed to air for abit too long  it could have degraded  Did it eventually resolve your Anhedonia  Actually the hospital may allow you to cut off contact   Or encourage it   Its a pretty outstanding perk if your in the mood to be left alone  There's a speech called "everybody's free to wear sunscreen"  it helped me alot when I was younger  In particular  one line   "don't feel guilty if you don't know what you want to do with your life  Some of the most interesting people I know didn't know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives  some of the MOST interesting 40 year Olds I know still dont  "     It sounds like you do care about people  You care about hurting them and what they think of you    you suffer for them  It sounds like you care     Just trust me  nobody is good at anything or really has fun hobbies at 18  Everyone goes around thinking about how everyone must have things figured out  when really nobody does    We all don't exist for a reason  but instead because we can  Things can change     I would say something super bold to them  Like "have you thought maybe I'm mentally ill and need help instead of teasing "  Mhm  in terms of grades I actually just try to get positive grades on the tests so I can finish school and my apprenticeship   I'm sorry you're under pressure from the people around you   Maybe you should take a couple days off  Do you have any holidays    Thank you and yeah  if 2017 does better a tiny bit that would be great I wish I were out at a bar or party  But I'm completely lonely at home  No one has texted me in over a week  I don't know how my life got this way  I try so hard to connect with others but I guess I am just completely forgettable   Man sometimes i wonder how we evolved that much with these inneficient brains  yes I remember it is not happening now I really dislike it when people say that being a relationship won't change anything  I'm sorry you had difficulties while being in a relationship  but saying that your experience is proof that it doesn't work for anyone else is just plain wrong  What doesn't work for you might work out for someone else  Be more understanding to the people who are suffering from depression  it's not the same for everyone     Happy new year    I hope life gets better for you    Is that a maltess  I have 3 of them   Man  I feel shit most of the time  I manage to medicate  or numb with alcohol or other shit  but I dont want others to suffer for because of me  sometimes however  the suffering can be overwhelming  for me  r BreakUps  Me too  Even when I do feel intense urges to end it  I still have this thought saying "what if"  Maybe if I hold out then things will somehow get better one day  Same to you too     Have you tried calling a hotline   Yeah mate fucked up New Years with this girl  she's coming around I'm hoping to set things right  not optimistic though I used to at least like things   I dont like or love anything anymore  not for years   tell me what you despise  Hey OP  you're awesome too  I hope you all have a happy new year or a new year with plans for change   Very true  I've tried to change things  hasn't worked  I'm going to start over  I'm scared and it won't be perfect  but better than what I've been doing  I hope it gets better for you in 2017     YES        It's Always Sunny always makes me laugh so hard  Charlie Day is actually from my home town  One of my favorite episodes ever is the Reynolds VS Reynolds one    "Oh Sandra  you dumb bitch "  I have done the online chat hotline because I was scared of calling and I'm making mistakes with what I've done sure  but I'm trying to improve soon  I'm planning on Starting therapy I live with my parents so I'm not completely alone tonight  But I wish I were  I hate having to explain to them all the time why I don't go out and stay at home in my room  I 100  understand what you mean about feeling like an outsider  No one seems to remember me when plans are made  Or maybe they purposefully exclude me  I don't know but it is hurtful  Nobody ever texts me first and if I don't message them  we don't talk  Literally no one has texted or called me in over a week  I crave true friendship and relationships and feel like I have a lot to offer but no one will give me a chance  I daydream all the time of what it is like to have best friends and a boyfriend and to actually have fun experiencing life with them  Obviously this takes a toll on my self esteem  It makes me feel inferior in many different aspects of my life    work  school  etc  I don't even see myself as lovable anymore    I hear all these people say to give up and get used to being alone but I don't want to do that  I won't make it the rest of my life this way  I am only 22  If things don't change I don't know how I will cope    I am sorry to go on this long rant but it has really been weighing on me too lately  I hope we both can find some answers and make some changes in 2017  Hope you have a happy new year   It's sad because i know i have the potentional to do stuff  I just never go at the "start signal"  My mind know that i can go  just move and shit will get done  But it just won't happen  time and time again that has happened  I sit idly as opportunities pass by me as i wish  "i could have done that" while im seeing the chance to kickstart something new slip me by  This thought might be arrogant or simply disrespectful towards other hardworking people   But I know because i have watched it many times and i know that it's inevitably going to happen again  Im not trying to brag of my "superior intellect" and such but i do think i am generally smart or rather just have an easy time learning things  I just feel my motivation draining and nothing gets done  The only productive things that happen is the things i have to do to keep my status as a functional member of society    This is just some incoherent rambling but i hope i have conveyed my message in some meaningful way  And no  you did not put me off with any of this  im always open for new perspectives  or i hope i am  I know this is a sad attempt to make people feel sorry for me and im not requiring anything from anybody  Just wanted to vent a bit in a disgraceful manner  It can't be worse either  No matters how bad it gets  at least you have someone who smiles to you everyday  We  the single  lonely people  don't have that  I would like to argue that feeling alone but not being supported by loved ones is caused by not being supported by yourself and supporting yourself by joining a crowd of supportive people  aka getting back in there   the work doesn't get rid of the feeling of heartbreak  especially if it's solitary work  I had this feeling during a nightshift and it felt like implosion Thank you very much  I have been thinking of trying Ritalin instead of the Dexedrine Vyvanse which my Doctor prefers  Yeah we all support you just tell us what's wrong we'll help they've done the same for me it helps makes things clearer I know it may seem like nobody cares but what if they really do  You think it helps but it doesn't    It doesn't help when I can't even take care of myself let alone someone else  Or you could go my way I planned on telling them just go see a counselor tell them and have them tell you're parents explain you're concerns about their reaction same thing for me  My best friend got back with his ex and suddenly he doesn't seem to put as much effort in our relationship as he used to    it's destroyed me I'm glad you are starting therapy  that's what helped me when I was really depressed  Do you think you'll be able to hang in there until you see a therapist   Well if they do then they have never showed it Be brave because I'm trying the same there are millions of us Depressed teens you can do it I'm ready for a fresh start  I've started off the year well  After this post  I got a few really nice and supportive messages from my friends   Don't hurt yourself try to get help and heal I feel similarly to you  I am probably in better conditions though  My recommendation to you would be to start small  I started with simple goals day by day to achieve    Last few weeks the goals has been to do four things immediately after waking up  I mean literally as soon as I am aware I am awake  I do this    See the sun   Make the bed   Shower   Have breakfast    I do this within an hour    It has had a significant improvement to my mental state and how I feel about every day  More optimistic  more motivated    So again  my advice is start small    The love for seroquel concerns me  mostly due to it being illegally marketed by drug reps  http   abcnews go com Politics Health astrazeneca pay 520 million illegally marketing seroquel schizophrenia story id 10488647    Maybe I am paranoid an unduly suspicious  but say  if a Psychiatrist had to come to the realization that they had been 'suckered' by drug reps  could that make themselves dig their feet in further  Insisting that they had not been suckered  that the drug reps spoke truths  Nobody likes to be suckered   I can't tell anymore which year is the worst  They all suck   I will soon  Nope  I tried to tell them  but it's hard  Go ahead man  I'm here   Get out there man  If you feel like your parents or friend dont really care about you or appreciate you  get out there and find new people  Go to a concert  an art show  an auction house and see what they have  go to a museum  Anywhere really  Just get your mind distracted from those thoughts   And If you want to talk about anything Pm me anytime   Do you have a date  Can you stay alive until you see your therapist   This year has gone from terrible to horrible  I have nearly nobody to turn to  especially in my times of need  I only have one good friend now  but a single person can't be here all the time  Childhood fucked me up and now I'm here loathing myself  knowing next year will be even worse than this one  and feeling like all I want is attention so I won't let myself make a post  I like to think every natural disaster is Earth's immune system trying get rid of the the cancer  Humans  Yeah  social media on weekends and nights like this is the fucking worst  Really makes you feel left out and just generally lonely  I've been chilling with my dog tonight  he's a pretty good bud to have around when no one else is They're just saying enjoy this shit while it last  they care they just suck at showing it  It's REALLY dumb but the only things that have managed to get through to me in the last few months and genuinely make me laugh is the situation on the TLC show Love at First Kiss with Josh  and the Kitchen Nightmares clip "You don't microwave a salad"   I don't even know what it was  they're not what I'm generally amused by  but I laughed like crazy for the first time in forever     fuck this the time of the year that makes us feel like fuckin loners  Oh it sucks that there is such a wide range of side effects that we are willing to tolerate over others  It is hard to draw the line  Tardive dyskinesia  or obesity  Sleep all day  or perhaps some kidney failure    I hate that it is so difficult to discern what exactly is causing the weight gain  Like you  when I am manic I am up all hours  my body clock is all disturbed  Food is also far tastier than usual    I so wish that I only needed to take these medications in short term crises periods  I find withdrawing from them so painful and frightening about relapse makes it so much worse   Thank you  It's worse because least a job I can quit and find a new one  but I only have this life  I really can't help you directly unfortunately  but what thought have you put into why you just let opportunities pass you by  You're smart but evidently not driven to succeed  For some  maybe a lot  of people like that  they let life pass them by because it's easier to 'not do' than to fail  but we all take our lumps  The only way to get through life without failing is to do nothing  but that in itself is the biggest failure of all    You may never become a pro ball player  the top lawyer at your firm  the most exciting guy in the room or what have you  but if you look down these paths then start to wander down them  you'll eventually find yourself playing catch with your son  teaching him about justice and doing the right thing  and making your friends or SO's eyes light up when you walk into a room    Along the way  you'll catch a ball to the face  get swamped with paperwork  and embarrass yourself trying to make someone laugh  but hell  will it be worth it to actually  live   I hope you eventually find the answer is yes  but I understand that putting in the effort needed for just a chance at happiness is daunting  There's a lot to overcome and you won't do it in one big leap then tomorrow will be all peachy  Baby step after baby step will take you miles if you don't quit    I just keep blowing up silently to myself when these annoying assholes expecting me to give them shit for free  I didn't actually hurt myself tonight  dark humor only  I've stopped and am seeing a therapist about that  Thank you for the concern though  Believe me you're not the only one alone  Gonna smoke  drink and play some video games to keep my mind off shit  Are there any shows you like to binge  You could get in your pajamas  make some popcorn and make it a party    Now  more than ever  it's important to remind yourself to be kind to yourself  Forget it's New Years if you have to  I hope you do take care of yourself  You deserve happiness just as much as the next person   Happy New Year  You need to stop trying and start living  Stop seeking for acceptance and accept yourself  I asked a few people if they wanted to hang out  most of them were going out with other friends  and didn't bother to invite me  So guess I'll just be sitting in my room  lol   I'm in a similar situation  Stuck in a rut  Go to the doctor  a therapist  someone  There are people who will listen  I picked out a random friend from way back in high school and he has helped me through just talking out the feelings   Day by day it gets better  but I still see the pain on my wife's face when I start to slide back down into the depression   Just remember this  You are not alone  Those 2 family members care about you  Talk to them  It would mean the world to them  That you would bring it to their attention   Hey I agree I used to feel this way   but now I realize I kinda do it to myself   Like I don't go out of my way to talk to people or hang  Even when I get invited places I normally turn it down so at some point people just stop inviting you to do things  It's hard because 99  of the time I want to be alone but the one percent I wanna do something I can't find people to hangout with   Also check out the song by die antwoord   alien  you may relate to it I know I do  not really into shows but thanks  I came to terms with what I have done and how I got to this level of depression   I did as you did   Bottled up emotions from work  irritations personally  etc  til an incident with some family broke me   Now I know my problem and am working on being a bit more open   Alone here with a pack of fag   I totally understand  I recently went through a breakup and all our plans for the New Year went down the drain  I don't have a lot of friends and almost none that I hang out with on a regular basis  This didn't bother me in the past  but now that I no longer have a girlfriend I'm really feeling the void  Don't feel worthless though  I am having the same battle right now and I just keep reminding myself that I'm not worthless  that I am loved  and that maybe next year will be better  Also  your English is really good  The only real mistakes I saw were that you used feel  present tense  instead of felt  past tense  and want  present tense  instead of wanted past tense  when describing how your brother felt pity for you   Fuck 2016 and those people  I hope you find happiness in the new year  Yay  Fake smiles and selfies everywhere I related to a lot of what you are saying  especially the part about being tired  I'm sorry you are dealing with all of that  I will listen to you if you have anything to say   This year was exhausting    Happy New Year  folks   may it be kind to you all   Nah  it isn't that it's not smart  There is nothing wrong with trying  and I'm sorry it didn't work out for you   I think you will find something you can connect to someone else with  Maybe I can tell you about an experience I had tonight   I went out for a new years party for a bit tonight  I never planned to stay too long  but I'm glad that I went even if I didn't leave really happy  or really drunk   It was still an experience  But anyway  I met a guy there  It seemed like we took a few college classes together a few years ago  I didn't feel interested in him in THAT way  but I kind of saw that he seemed sad  I've been feeling sad too and  I dunno  I just kind of wanted someone to talk to about something REAL  I was interested in helping him too  not just venting for my own sake    But  in the end  he choose to go with a girl for sex  And that is all right  we didn't even barely become acquaintances  And  if that's what he wanted tonight  that's okay  There is nothing wrong with it   I'm   bummed that I didn't get to make a  potentially  significant friendship   Sorry  this was probably something I just want to vent talk about a bit and I kinda seized this opportunity  but it isn't totally unrelated to your story I think   Even though my experience didn't have the result I hoped for either  my point is that it is so likely you'll see something  that something might click when you meet someone  You've been through a lot in your life  I bet  Maybe you'll see someone  a girl  she has this look about her that you recognize  You'll think  "yeah  I've been there"  You'll want to talk to her   You've been through a hurt  and I bet you'd want something substantial  too  Something that means something  even if it isn't romantic  I hope we can both find it  I don't understand why you're bitching at me  I  only said that I'm tired of hearing the same bogus advice from people who don't understand what it's like to be unloved    And I never said my problems stemmed from a relationship  quite the opposite  my depression comes partially from never getting to be in a relationship    Also  I'm not fucking harassing depressed people  You are  Go the fuck away  Nobody needs your bitchiness   Thanks  good timing reading this Thanks Its because they dont know how to help  You'll be okay  Me either   Im pretty sure I havent been to work in a while   I thought things would be different   I thought if rhings were hard i'd have to be some kind of vagabond like a soldier or police officer   Butnits so kich worse I just have this job and that job  and its always so doable   I can do this job that I don't want to do   And another year goes by    The very idea of a hint of dignity is old fashioned   I am so lucky to work and to have an even half way good job   And let me stop me right ther  because I am so lucky   And isn't some Algerian dude depresswd his father wont acknoledge he is due some wealth from some oil wells   I met a guy in this position  lord lnows what became of him   Anyway  I lost my train of thought   But I lnow some people are happy   People of my age  aproximately my looks are digging it and doing alright   And I don't understand at all     Whats going on   I'll die relatively soon   I'll live through first world problems   Could I hack it as a racoon    I suppose it would be similar enough     Probably the 3rd You still have the certification from the course  Why cant you find another similar job  You are probably right to feel screwed over  but it wont do you any good to dwell on it     good then Gotta at least give it a chance She looks just like the dog I used to have   3 Happy New Year to you both   So  because some people have it worse I can't be depressed  Because you're happy being single I can't be depressed  Being single isn't the only thing making me depressed  but it is one of the things  My chemical imbalance isn't subject to your discretion  Go fuck yourself  That's not too far away  Can you hold on until then  Make sure you are honest with your therapist about how depressed you are so they can best help you  Man  you definitely have a right to feel that way  Take it easy on yourself  I hope it'll all get better for you  Man  you definitely have a right to feel that way  Take it easy on yourself  I hope it'll all get better for you  It is nuts how people get angry   I've been in full on fights wear I was bored and without enthusiasm  but my bosses have lost it because I was listening to too liberal talk radio    Thank you for the advice  I hadn't realized that temazepam could be making things worse      My psychiatrist actually started me on just lamotrigine  I had serious neurological side effects from lithium of all things  and was on zero medication for observation for a few months   I am not sure if lamotrigine does anything for me  except perhaps reduce mania frequency  it certainly didn't help with depression     After a year or 2 of misery I was "allowed" citalopram  which is wonderful  my depression and anxiety lifted rapidly  but without hypomania or anything  except during a crisis period 3 years later  It seems like it is just the withdrawal from seroquel that is destabilising things        That's really shitty and inconsiderate of them to do   There are so many people here who just wanna talk to someone and not feel lonely  I wish we could all just get together in a room and hang out for a bit  Why jan 5th  Yep I'm home alone   Just browsing the net  mindlessly munching  and I plan to smoke pot a little later on  Probably going to watch a movie or play a game   25 and just discovered I'm going bald  Big confidence boost  Stay positive brother we're all in this together     There's a small chance of it happening to anyone  Same fam  Relentless  That is what I need to remember  It's not a side effect that will disappear on it's own   I'm 22  I found my first grey hair on my head this morning  Crazy  right    It's because I'm so stressed I'm p sure  This is one of the reasons  4 hurts so bad  I don't want to burden anyone else with being with me  Fuck yeah  Congratulations on trying your best man that's all that you can do  Cheers  Oh yeah my cat died also  YEP GOOD YEAR FOR ME  what is that like a buck in todays currency  Yes  it makes me think that they are either intellectually lazy  greedy for drug rep benefits  or dangerously stubborn   I feel you  I've gotten to a point where I feel like I'm putting too much strain on a close friend  even if he tries to reassure me  There no way he can't hurt  you know  I'm starting to feel like I need to vent to him less  and have more fun with him instead  It's hard   I've gotten used to going to him for help  But I think   I need to try to find something else before I loose something that means everything to me  I hope that you don't loose your friends  I'm sure they care for you  Be sure to still have fun somehow  We have to find a way to thank the people who are willing to hear us out  help us in our darkest moments  I just can't think of anything better we could do except do our best to be happy  Doesn't mean they should hell at me   It's not like we can help it That's really sad  It seems to me he cares  but sometimes people get so wrapped up in their SOs that they forget that their friends need and care for them too   Does he know how you feel  I think just ending things like that would cause a lot of pain and confusion for both of you  He might have no idea why you no longer wish to be freinds with him  It's really really hard to have the "I think I love you" conversation with someone when you're fairly certain the answer from them will be no  And I'm not going to lie  when you hear the "no" it hurts like hell because it shatters the last bit of hope you held on to    But at the same time  hopefully this person can handle this confession with tact and respect and you two can work through it  Some friendships can weather that storm  and become stronger for it  And if it does get to the point where you decide it's too painful to carry on with the friendship  at least you have no "what ifs" and you both know where you stand   Same  and no one speaks to me  Vicious cycle  Damn this is me to a T  I'm currently living with my parents and I'm am pretty anxious about moving out because they are my main source of comfort and help me to feel a lot less lonely  When I move out next year I don't even want to think about how I'll be coming home from a shitty day to an empty house  I can totally relate  Hello  fellow 17 year old here  I hope everything goes well once you get into college  I started school early  so I've already completed my first semester  My advice to you would be to try to not let your depression get the best of you during those first few months of college  I did  and I've basically destroyed all of the friendships I had built in both high school and the first weeks of college  Be strong  and happy new year  It's disappointing because good days can happen  but somehow they don't last  Well  on the bright side not every day is bad lol  If you listen to counting crows you're automatically a friend of mine    Definitely one of my favourites  and one of my favourites to show others  Stay awesome Yes I think I can Thank  you for the positivity I wish you all the best     also thank mr skeltal for good bones and calcium Well shit  hope you didn't follow through  Same  2016 just felt like the universe playing some cosmic joke on me  I know for a fact that 2017 will continue down the same path unless I actively make a change  If I don't I'll probably kill myself sometime next summer or fall  and I don't want that to happen  I want to live  I know I can feel happiness if I work for it  That's why I've decided I'm going to war with mySelf next year  I'm fucking done with this shit  so fucking tired of always feeling bad about who I am and my place in the world  It's time to finally take back control  Real control  Glad to hear it    feel free to message me if you ever need to talk  and don't be afraid to reach out to a hotline or your therapist if you ever feel suicidal again   Please dont kill yourself  you even listed the reasons to live  Illnesses can be treated  people are here for you  you dont need to die  Even though i suffer from my own mountain of issues i still believe that if you fight hard enough things will work out in the end  Things will get better for you  youll find someone who cares about you  about your personality and not just your looks  There will always be treatments for illnesses  and death is such an extreme way out  At least try some of the treatments  What do you have to lose by trying if you want to die anyway  Best case you get better and you keep on living  You dont need to die  I wish the best for you  Stay devoted and always keep the goal in mind  No matter how hard it is  that feeling of true happiness will always be worth it  Sweet   It was my best and worst year all at the same time I'm sorry  it wasn't intended at you  I'm just saying when someone makes a thread like this or talk about it in real life  people have a habit of using their experience as the truth to people who struggle to get a relationship  I'm with you  sorry if it came out wrong   Just adding some background to why I wrote it  There was a thread before saying how someone felt alone being without a SO and most people in the thread were replying how being in a relationship wont fix anything  I was kind of frustrated with their replies because they think their bad experiences of being in a relationship meant relationships are bad for everyone with depression in general  This happened to me  but I have a good idea of why  I understand the behavior I did that caused it to happen  but it hurts so bad   I honestly know the feeling  same shit is happening to me right now  among other things  It might not be something you did  but something in their lives thats changed  Did you all just graduate or something  Maybe theyre moving on to jobs and college like my friends  It most likely has nothing to do with anything you did  listen you can lose weight easily  you have to do it for you though  Don't start chucking the diet pills or hitting the gym because they told you negative things  You have to accept yourself no matter what  This doesn't have much value coming from me because I am literally having this problem now  Anyways your not alone  I know exactly how you feel  First of all  have a wonderful birthday  No matter what lemons life gives you  you be strong  I can't imagine how to even feel the pain you've suffered but I hope for all the best in life ahead  Have a virtual hug from me and if you need to talk to a random person  whether to vent or just a casual chat hit me up with a PM  Happy New Year  Im in the same situation  You arent alone  I'm so sorry    You sound like a very beautiful person and I wish I could get to know you  Some people are just awful  It's how this world is  I don't know why people choose to be so shitty  but they do  It's dumb but it's just how it is  I wish we could hang out in real life    Motherfucking horses    Same dude  Shit sucks  I really hate holidays because they always remember how alone I am  Im trying to eat less  but its hard  due to all the other issues  i feel like eating might be part of how i soothe myself  like stress eating or whatever  I think that maybe alot of my problems are tied to each other  idk  Thanks for the advice  Since I'm going to a college in another state  making and keeping new friends is going to be important  Im glad that I was able to finally let my feelings out and be taken seriously amd able to comverse with others like me  Thank you and happy new year to you too  Maybe it's time to try something new  These are "dead mans goals" because you can never really achieve them  you never really know when you're there or how far you have to go   Why not start with stuff like   Not turn on phone for first half hour in the morning Meditate for 10 minutes every morning Work out three times a week Try going to a new place once a month Eat salad three times a week  Or anything else you can think of that will slowly turn your life healthier The offered job was in the art domain but the course is rarely something used for art  So I have extremly low chances of using the course for an art job   It's been months trying to find a half decent job and nothing  I'm not even that picky for jobs   Please don't give up I am very sad as well   Beat wishes on your your twentieth  Same here man  Thanks but it just doesnt get better  It's been months and my bank account is in the red  I just feel so out of solutions at this point  They aren't shitty people is the thing  I know them  I have spent countless nights and days with them  I have literally been told by them that they are my best friends  I have been friends with them for my whole life that I remember  I just don't get it  I love you too and thank you  May 2017 be easier to bear than 2016 for you  for all   I want a drunk driver to hit me any night I would argue with that cocksucking cashier so hard  "Put yourself out there " Seriously  What's the point in putting yourself out there if you're practically invisible or just plain introverted like myself   I've been drinking alone this New Year's Eve just like last year so I'm kinda sad and lonely and drunk rn but happy New Years to al of you guys  this is the only subreddit I always feel welcome in  I love you all   I love all you internet strangers too  I'm glad we have this place to vent together  Stay strong and have a better new year   Edit  Am drunk too  Yeah  I feel the same way so I don't know how to help you  I'm sorry you have to go through this shit man  That's hard  Sometimes there are things about ourselves that feel our of our control    have you ever talked to a therapist     Who are you   Who   Drinking alone  thinking about texting my ex even though I know it's a bad idea   spent mine feeling empty and spacing out on a couch while the people around me cheered and laughed Remember a very important fact  The more open you can be the better  and faster  a therapist can help  I thought of main points  my history as I understand it  I wanted to get across on the first visit and maybe a little on the second and we went from there  He was a little surprised and said so  I replied why should I hold back  if I do you can't help me  I am brutally honest and open with him  Sadly thanks to insurance I had to switch and started the process all over  the second time was a little easier  As for the can of worms  It needs to be opened  you can not empty it out and hopefully heal if it stays closed  Invisible  That's exactly how I feel and everybody I tell thinks it's bullshit  A woman's gaze can pass through me without the tiniest pause  I feel like a ghost  Spent mine feeling wholly out of place in a club  It was the most alone I have ever felt in a  relatively  crowded room  I too am spending new years alone  I will down my traditional can of coke a cola in your honour bro  Stay positive  and remember that you don't need to be out in groups to be happy and have a good time  Your so right let me thank him now  Please try to talk to your parents  man  I had my first suicidal ideations at 12  and I don't know what I'd have done without my folks  If they won't listen or help  talk to a school counselor  or any adult who will listen and get you the help you need  You have so much life ahead of you  Stay strong  As a formerly depressed person  for me it was thinking those sorts of thoughts that led me to being depressed in the first place  It becomes self fulfilling  Meditation can help with this    Another question to ask yourself  Why does everyone despise you  I have a hard time believing this is true in the first place  but if you really think it is  try to analyze things from their perspective to see what it may be and what you can change  One tough thing about being depressed is that you don't feel like interacting with others or if you do  the interactions feel forced and unpleasant  People  being interested in only themselves  and you can't blame them  you are too   might take your bad mood the wrong way and like you less for it  Some people get tired of being your shoulder to cry on  I'm not saying this is good  this is just the way things are    A final thought for you    things probably won't change on their own  Stop focusing so much on how you bad you feel and start analyzing the situation objectively so you can fix it  Good luck  I love the last few sentences especially " I will make 2017 my bitch"  Hell yes      I need to be stronger   But 2017  you are mine What would your favorite song be  I'm quite fond of Another Horsemariner's Dream  Too many to count What's up  I like that song    Don't feel bad me too bud Tnx   And as always I had to fight with a gf  So I have decided to listen at your advice and it worked  Have enjoyed  it atleast a little bit till alcohol  Things work out quite good  Thank you    And how was your new year  He knows  I've been fairly vocal with him about my feelings  He's my best friend so he's the first person I talk to when I don't feel good   I learned last year that I was never an option for him romantically  he doesn't see me that way  although he kept that foggy for the first year of our relationship  When I'd tell him how I felt about him  it was always a "I don't want to mess up the status quo"  but he kept saying I was the most important person to him    So that messed me up a lot haha   So I'm pretty set of the "what ifs"    there is no romantic hope  only friendship  but I don't know how I can handle him being back with his ex  there's a whole other story about that guy  but I don't want to get into details  cause it'll just make my whole story sound even more pathetic   I was handling it ok  but the Holidays  and knwing he's with him now  probably having fun and partying  while I'm all alone    it's hard I've been sitting here for around an hour now  wondering how in the world I was going to start this comment  Thinking to myself  "No  that's a shit way to start " or "What if someone I know recognized my username and started mocking me about what I was saying " Even as I write this  I think to myself  "Why would anyone be interested in what you have to say " or the one time m dad told me   Once was all he needed  "Man up " And with that I think to myself "Guys shouldn't cry" or "Guys don't talk about feelings and get emotional "  I guess what I'm trying to say is that I understand the inferiority that you feel  The feeling of "I need to be the best at everything  or I am nothing " Now  I'm not going to say that I know exactly what you are going through because I don't  I also don't want to sound like I have it worse therefore you shouldn't have anything to complain about   I've had people say to me plenty of times that they understand what I'm going through and all that crap  but when I ask them to describe it they either can't or just repeat what I said to them  I've also had people try to "one up" my issues like a fucking game to see who's life is shittier and who should shut up because the other has it worse  Either that or they just straight up tell me  "There are others who have it worse than you " and I hate it more than anything so it's the last thing I would want to do to someone else    I recently graduated from high school and I am living at my parents house still  I constantly think to myself everyday  "Look at you  sitting here day after day  playing games watching movies and browsing the internet  Useless "  "You don't have a job  nor do you help around the house hardly ever  You just sit here wasting everyone's time and money "  My best friend from when I stared school up to when I got to high school was great  We did everything together whenever we could  It was great  When we got to high school however  I started to talk to him about certain things that bothered me or that I was struggling with  He started to "one up" me one shitty things that happened to him and didn't care about my problems at all  Once he got a group of friends who liked to smoke  drink  skate  steal etc  He only ever called me if all of his other friends were busy  And stupid me  I would always oblige thinking that maybe one day he would actually enjoy my company again  I started to think that he never actually wanted me around even when we were younger  Just the thought that someone could just dump a friend off like that after 6 7 years like nothing infuriated me  and killed me  The possibility that I was just "filler" that whole time was absolutely heartbreaking to me  From then on  I tried to fit in the best I could with whoever I could  Even if we had nothing in common I  just wanted people to appreciate me  for real this time  So I started to try to be the best at everything  If someone liked sports  I had to be the best at that so they might accept me  did they appreciate someone with good grades  Had to be the best at that too  I started to hang around with people I didn't even like just to be accepted  constantly worrying that they would just leave me in the blink of an eye  Through the years I found some friends that I actually liked to be around and felt  reasonably  comfortable with  But they always moved away   It had started my obsession with being someone I wasn't  It was who I was now  I can't even remember how it felt to be me  My thoughts are always scattered and fragmented and there are times when I literally can't form thoughts that even make sense to me  Trying to speak to people is difficult because I have no idea what to say or even how to say it because I'm trying to think of what they want to hear rather than what I would say  I am so distracted with trying to fit in  I literally don't know what kind of person I am  Am I nice  Am I loud  Am I annoying  Am I thoughtful   All of the shit I've had thrown at me used to make me sad and lonely and that became a normal feeling  Recently  it's been either I feel nothing or I feel hatred towards anything  everything  Hatred  thinking that I deserve all of this  but why  What the actual fuck did I do to feel like this   Most of my hatred however is directed at god  if there is one   My mom is religious and so took me to church when I was younger  Didn't think to much on the concept of god mostly because the people attending that church were all cunts so I just assumed that all Christians were that way  Later though about half way through high school  I thought I found my "salvation" so to speak  I had found people that I really enjoyed being around  still nervous around though   It was a youth group organized through two churches  one nearby and one out of town  It was a small group of people who I could have thoughtful conversations with  It was the only thing really worth living for  I thought to myself  "If this is what being a christian is all about  count me in " I would pray to god go to church  the works  After a few months  however  most of the people there had graduated and moved off to University or College and the majority of the group was replaced with a bunch of loud  annoying 10 14 year olds  I was utterly destroyed yet again  It was all back to normal now  I started to blame god for everything  started to build up all of my hatred towards everything  I've built up so much hatred for god and life that I get so unbelievably angry at everything that annoys me  Now the only thing that makes me even remotely happy is the escape that games provide  It's not enough but it's something   Every time something goes wrong in game  aside from if an enemy kills me or something  I get infuriated  For example if my internet is suddenly slow and I can't play a game that requires internet connection or if my game crashes I get so angry it's ridiculous sometimes leading to fits of rage telling god to die  I think the reason is that  I feel as though god has taken so much from me including my entire personality that I have to feel protective of what Good thing I have left  That being games   I'm sorry this got a little off track from my original statement about relating to your sense of inferiority compared to others  Sorry if this seems like more of a rant than anything  I hope you could follow all of it without much difficulty  Like I said  it's been difficult for me to even form sensible thoughts never mind explaining something to someone else   I'm also not sure how this would help in anyway  but I felt the need to post here   Edit  Sorry for the wall of text too  I'm sorry  I just want you to know I read your post  I hope you don't go through with it  and that I hope something happens that brightens your day for a change  But if you do go through with it  I hope you'll find yourself at peace   Same  Happy New Year to you as well I am here if you need to talk  just send me a PM  Same situation here  Sucks  doesn't it     Me too  friend  There is always help   Please PM me  and we can talk  There is no need to end your life  I promise   PM me  and I will talk about anything you want  Well then ask them why they don't invite you  They may just think you're not interested  Same    God dammit I wish I could stop giving a fuck  I try so hard but it every now and then it hurts to be so lonely  Way to take that rejection and keep going  Congrats  I very often hope a bomb crash on my house  What a cute pup  Dogs are the fucking best  Happy New Year  I'm drunk and on Reddit  Wishing all of  r depression the best for 2017  Wow it's been 5 years of depression  Can't wait for another year of dying inside  People on the internet are much different of how they are in real life   I've been trying to get that fresh start  For years  It never came  I get exactly how you feel  I'm glad I'm at my house with my family for NYE for the moments I need to retreat back to my room  2016 has been the worst year for me mentally and I don't have much hope for this year    I also spent a lot of my time sleeping  for me it's a sweet escape from reality  I do have a couple friends but that's it  My bff is going to school out of state and my other friend  while I do care for her  just don't have much in common and she doesn't know how depressed I am  I can't tell her or my family  I feel too ashamed    I'm in college but the thing is is that I was supposed to sign up for my classes for my next semester starting in a few weeks and I didn't  I have 4 days left to sign up and even if I did  I'm not sure I'd get the money in time  So I guess it's too late  I also just have no motivation  I just need a break from school even though I can't afford to take one    I also felt completely out of place  Everyone was laughing and joking around and happily shouting Happy New Year and I felt no joy or excitement  Yes  it's a new year  but a happy one  Hmm I don't know about that  More like a year full of anger  depression  misery  apathy  failure and virtually no personal growth whatsoever  Happy New Year    NOT    Just to let you know  I care and just try your best to hang in there  I know it's tough but if it brings you any comfort at all  know you're not alone  Sorry for just rambling on and on about my life   Last week I cleaned all my computer's and deleted accounts like this one  I don't have much money but I pulled it all out and put it in a box for my brother  I'm looking for a reason to just keep going but I feel like a hamster just doing the same thing over and over  I know I will never find anyone with my current personality but I'm so fucking broken inside I don't know how to be happy to attract someone  And I'm not happy because I'm so damn lonely and the thought of growing old and being alone my entire life makes me want to just give up Just know that there is no such thing as 'being normal'  I encourage you to spend some time with family  Being with anyone is better than being alone   So cute     Dogs really are so special and can soothe us in so many ways  Please tell your pup that I think he is very handsome      I started talking to a counselor first  It was hard to open up  and it was also hard for me to figure out why and what I was feeling  and after around 4 or 5 months of counseling I started seeing a psychiatrist  By that point it was easier for me to talk to the psychiatrist because I learned to open up with the counselor more  I got meds and I'm feeling better now  but a little different  I don't feel much emotions anymore and it's really hard for me to trust people now  But I think being able to open up is an important thing  They might be able to help you learn how to deal and handle your feelings  and I think once I was able to open up I felt a bit better since I didn't feel as if I had to hold everything in  110  worth it  Mac's whole evolution argument science is a liar sometimes was brilliant  the whole episode really    "He created a reasonable doubt  he makes you sound like a stupid science bitch " Miserable alone  together  The thought makes me ill  I've learned some people are just not made for interaction  It's sucks buts true There is a story I'd like to tell you  please feel free to shoot me a PM if you're interested    I encourage you to spend some time with family   I'd attempt that if they weren't so drunk and rowdy already  All they are doing is annoying me  At least they're having fun with themselves  i guess Anything can happen in 2017  Happy new year to you and I hope this one won't be a waste    it doesn't have to stay that way  time as humans describe it is arbitrary    for example  it's still 2016 where I am so to me it's your 2016 that ended terribly  not your 2017 that started terribly  I hope it gets better  3  I know it's hard as things change   Please feel free to shoot me a PM if you need someone to talk to tonight  Interesting year for sure God this is me  I need to stop being a pathetic sack of shit too  I don't think it's very realistic for me though   I'm sorry your night didn't turn out like you hoped  I'm alone here as well  unless you count my dog and two asshole cats  My only real friend is 1500 miles away  so I'm enjoying a nice beer and perusing reddit  A Long December is my current favourite  But Another Horse Dreamers Blues is awesome  Mr Jones was the song that got me started  because my local pop radio actually played it  and I fell in love  There's always an answer to escape suicide  You may not know it  but why not live and find out  I'm glad you made it   It's not an easy road to change  and your mind will fight you the entire time you're trying  but just take it one step at a time   You'll get there if you believe in yourself  I want to say it "helps" that I don't get my hopes up anymore  but these years of not looking forward to anything have just made me more dead inside   Thank you for responding and not being an ass like the other guy that commented in  Mine is ''Survive'' I was guessing based on the two symptoms I mentioned but you'd need to speak with the doctor   see my other response to a similar suggestion Can't upvote this hard enough  I quit Facebook a couple years a go and am so glad I did  It's just a filter for showing all the amazing shit in people's lives and making you feel like a loser  Fucking salad cured my depression    Thanks for the laugh  Happy new years   What a shitty year  hope you all are doing alright  Don't got high hopes for 2017  waiting for 2018 to come by already  Sex is a complicated subject  and isn't the exact same for every single person on this earth   Some us enjoy the idea of just being with someone for the sake of being  but others need a real connection with someone   Focus less on the sex  and more on getting to know someone with meaning to you  it might be closer to what you're looking for  That's the sad part  The BS isnt over  Its 100  going to spill in 2017  Desire just took over and I cut myself again on my arm  I hope this isn't indicative of what's to come this next year  I'm planning on talking to a pysch soon so hopefully that'll help  I just feel so alone in how I feel  like I have no one to relate to   It's very common for someone to want to want to die  and want to live  at the same time   When we're sitting in that dark room  pain in our eyes  as we feel a minute  cold  metal  against our temples  and our finger muscle just       Can't       Take that last step       And we struggle  and shake  and stare into the mirror  and curse ourselves for being weak  for not being strong  for not having constitution  we need to consider the view most ignored   Sometimes  we don't really want to die   We just don't want to hurt anymore  Happy New Year  i dunno what to feel about this but  okay  stay strong buddy Im very sorry to hear that but death is not the answer  Have you tried getting professional help for your depression  Anything you like to do  Or distracts you for a bit  Could always just sleep too        Feel bad   Never sleep near people  Its just a number  life will keep its same course  the number has no signifcancy i fear Medication helps too I guess    Spot on  I just don't want to hurt anymore  why  Hey  I'm sorry you been depressed lately  Sorry about the family problems and rejection  It's cool that you got a job though  And started your own fucking podcast   What is it called  Ha  it is a bitch  The human brain can be a bitch sometimes  or a lot of times   You dont have to get your hopes up if you don't want you but I'LL definitely be hoping you'll have a better year man  I would love that  Why must life be so hard   Why must I fail af every attempt at masonry  have no friends due to social anxiety and moving to a new state and parents would rather hang out with their high school friends than stay with me    "it's okay to be alone on new years eve"  Nah man  it isn't   It sucks  Happy new year  Thanks for the reply   I agree  I need to focus less on the actual act of sex   Unfortunately I let my sexual anxiety problem fester into a massive inferiority complex to the point where I don't even feel worthy talking to girls  and as soon as they give any indication they are sexually interested I don't know what to do   It doesn't help that I go to FSU and was involved in the greek system  a culture where every young man's self worth is determined by the sexual access he has   Real life just hit me all at once  I've been relatively fortunate in that I didn't experience much death and loss in general before this year    My best friend moved around the world and joined a dangerous cult while in the middle of a manic episode  Another friend killed himself  Two months later another friend killed himself  I got laid off a month or two later  My great grandfather died  although that was a timely and comfortable death  which I'm grateful for   In July my step mom died young  I was very close with her  By this point my already existing alcoholism became completely out of control  My family and long time girlfriend did an intervention  I agreed to go to treatment  At that point things were supposed to look up but while I was in treatment my girlfriend moved a guy in and they were sleeping together in our bed and all that shit  She started acting like a completely different person  I didn't bother fighting her on the apartment and bed because it felt gross even though we rented together  Still trying to get my things but she's dodging me and the new boyfriend is harrassing me    Aside from how I've felt I've watched a lot of these things really hurt people I love  It's been dark    There are positives though  I completed a 10 week treatment program  I'm 3 5 months clean and sober  Its new years and I'm not drunk  I still have my family and a lot of people that love me  I'm sheltered and fed  I havent tried to kill myself   I hear ya  Would listening to more upbeat music help  Even cheesy silly shit I love that feeling  I know the isolation is bad for me but sitting unnoticed in a bar or club is somehow more isolating than being alone in the wilderness   I meant Another Horsedreamer's Blues  I got it combined with a story lol   The two you listed are awesome as well  I love Possibility Days  as said  and God Of Ocean Tides And there is absolutely nothing selfish about that   People like to twist that with us  because they can't understand   The simple idea of being suicidal  I believe  opens a door in our minds   A heavy door  that's very difficult to shut   Even as we become happier  and get a better control on our lives  that door could still be open     There are people who don't understand how difficult that open door is to ignore  and bastardize it   They bastardize us   An important thing to note is that this is not done maliciously  people can care about you  and be angry with your choices   The thing that's helped me recently  is to view myself as a resource   Seems a waste to get rid of this physically healthy human being  when I can do things like stay up late on NYE and talk to people feeling the same pain I've felt for most of my life  Hey  me too  No offence taken understand you I feel the same  Another year expecting things to change and feeling isolated and alone as usual  someone just please make this stop     Look you  whats the worst an awake human can do to you   So fuck you    First things first  cut the sad music  no need to make yourself feel sad  It's 2017 and there's hope for new opportunities that can present itself to you  hopefully ones that can make you happy  Life is like a cult Good luck  I hope you can find something you can relate to soon  Yes  those are great songs  I mainly listen to Counting Crows and Eric Clapton actually  Especially Eric's songs about the passing of his son  they are so deep and meaningful to me   And his guitar playing doesn't hurt    I wonder how many of these you guys ticked off the list  I have atleast 5 of those  Eating healthy didn't 'cure' my depression but it made my mood swings a hell of a lot more stable  It's one thing I've changed that helped my depression  No one thing is going to cure you  It's a mix of getting good social interaction  not believing your distorted thoughts and changing perspective  living a healthy life  which includes fruits and veggies  cutting out processed food  exercise  getting enough sleep  cutting back on screen use      For me personally  it's worked a hell of a lot better than antidepressants  and I've tried numerous types over 15 years   Or you can just hope to magically become happy without doing anything to try and move towards that  too   I knew I'd be spending this one alone  as I do every year   so I decided to spoil myself a little  Got some nice cheese  cured meats  and a good beer  and am enjoying them by myself  well  with the dog and cats   Yeah  it hurts being along again on NYE  but I did a little something for myself so it hurts a little less  I'm glad that you are     The importance of the systems around us are often out of control  but this is one of few instances where the importance can be defined by you   What works for the crowd doesn't necessarily work for everyone  just as sex is different for everyone   There are better outlets for you to obtain self worth     Keep in mind  part of your performance issue could be directly related to your anxieties related to it  This was year was also the worst year of my life  I've had depression for a long time but this entire was just terrible suffering  I hope to god it's better in 2017  but I doubt it  Hey  you don't  know  next year will be worse  Sometimes things have to get worse before they can get better  Like addicts say "hitting rock bottom" makes them realize they need to change their life   And there's nothing wrong with wanting attention  Humans are social animals and we all want to feel safe and loved     hugs back   i dunno where you're coming from with that post  help me understand  Wow  that was tough to read  Please don't do it  You sound like you have so much going for you  I know it feels like you don't  but sometimes an outside perspective can see things more clearly than you  No  I don't have a clue about your illnesses  but like others have said  there are other resources and it can get better  Just give it some more time and talk to someone about how you feel    You said it yourself  you don't want to die  Don't give up  Youll get used to it eventually  At first you might be bitter from loneliness but maybe you wont mind it    in a few years  Shit  I just started watching Sunny for the first tome and saw that one last night  Love it  Good luck  It's good you're staying positive  Hope you find a good therapist and you can get something out of it   Imeab the bbq ibstructions werw complex at h best That sounds good  the turnaround   I wasn't into going to a NYE party  Good conversations like that can't be beat  Same deal here man  I gave up on my old friends and just started going out alone and meeting other lonely people at bars  My newer aquaintances don't respond all the time  but it helps knowing I can go find someone random to talk to if they don't   They are projecting their frustration on you  because that is easier than confronting their own feelings   Nihilism will help  I turned to it as an excuse for my depression but it's just led me to try and improve my life   most people that give those tips are people that have likely been sociable for quite some time and don't really see the other side of the story  or they haven't been depressed in so long they don't realize what it feels like anymore  What's your favorite CC song  There's only fire   You said that so many times you find yourself wanting to see a specialist  Then  yes  you should  People don't deserve to be feeling terrible and asking themselves why they are living    If there are counselors or psychiatrists in your area then I would contact them if possible  I know it doesn't work for everyone  but it's worth a shot   It helped with me   I hope things get better  PM me if you have questions or just want to talk  Somehow newyears is rhe worst I'm so sorry  I don't know what I'd do without my dog  I know they can't be replaced  but can you get another one  Kicked off the new year with another social rejection and feeling ignored as usual  Yay   Me too  I used to be paralyzed with it  My friends are off getting their Master's  getting married and so on  I'm just trying to figure it out  A lot of people are in the same boat  if it helps   I suggest you go anyways  Especially because you're feeling particularly alone  If you have the money  please go and don't let it get worse  A lot of us are beyond that point and it is so SO hard to turn back  Your mental health is worth a professional's time even if it's short term  Please don't wait until you are "bad enough "  RIP 2015  2014  and 2013  You guys will always be missed  It's hard  I'm trying my damnedest  One step at a time  I guess   what happened  yo Crying at the start of the New Year  Oh how fucking auspicious  There is no "supposed to" sometimes I can't help but think "hit me hit me hit me hit me" when I'm walking in front of a car that eventually stops  maybe one day it won't stop   I dont know  I eat healthy  I do meditation  I try to see people  I dont take antidepressants and I just feel like there's no end  It's just the purgatory constantly no matter what  Did you read my diary  I wish you all the luck in this new year   I was trying to disconnect my dead water softener and almost flooded the garage  Took a nice hot shower  started the fire and had a good beer  Trying not to think about all the fun the rest of the world is having  Man  fuck social media  I feel like I'm in the exact same situation and I want to change that in 2017  I have no idea how though  Fml   I was like that for a while a few months ago but it's really starting to pile on and I can't ignore it anymore   I guess its on me to wait until I find something that interests me  Thanks  means a lot     Hang in there  I hope you find the strength to make the changes you need  I'm so sorry you lost your friend  I hope you can find someone to talk to about it  I really think it could help  please don't  Things an change  Things  will  change   Absolutely brilliant show  Watch it from the beginning since they frequently refer to past episodes actor characteristics  First season is good  but probably the least interesting  Then season two  Danny Devito joins and every episode from then on is hilarious  Thank you Eh  people suck anyways  Just pick a few you like and hang on tight     Happy new year   Hope 2017 is a great one for you as well  Hey what's up  It's nothing  just another weekly depressive episode   Thanks for asking though Good job for doing all that  Seriously  A lot of people don't make the effort to live a healthy life  Give yourself props for everything you've been doing  for trying to improve your life  Have compassion towards yourself   Have to tried Metta LovingKindness mediation  I can't say I'm all in love with myself now but I did feel a bit of a shift  I did it every day for two weeks   Hi I'm into S3 now  Loving it  I was thinking this just now    There are support groups in many places  I've been going to Refuge Recovery groups despite not having addiction issues  There might be ones even more geared towards depression  Sadly I don't think he knows the difference  He's just a spiteful little shit who gets off on the pain of others  I mean he's enjoying the feelings of depression that urgeless is feeling right now   we are here for you man Ill post the math theorem here once the whole issue is resolved  It will make me feel better   That's a shitty deal  My not very good advice would be to go get lots of alcohol your drug of choice  a decent hooker  then drink and fuck until you forget the whole thing  But you probably shouldn't listen to that  Work on your confidence bud  things'll get better  Hope it gets better  So I've spent a lot of time reading and thinking about this subject and over the last year or two my mood has improved significantly  I'd consider myself happy maybe 70 80  of the time   First you need to understand what makes you unhappy and generally  unhappiness comes from three sources    The first way is that your brain just isn't producing or maintaining enough of the chemicals that make you happy  This is persistent unhappiness and is due to a systematic problem that needs to be fixed  We usually just label it depression  but there are a myriad of things that can cause this  Drug and alcohol abuse are common ways to screw up your brain  When you exercise or have sex  your body endogenously produces some feel good chemicals  The system that regulates this has evolved for thousands and thousands of years and will not overdose your brain on these feel good chemicals  When you're pouring in chemicals from an external source  there is basically no way to regulate the dosage so it is very easy to go above whatever limit would be considered safe  Having persistent sleep issues that have no apparent source or feeling anxious or sad ALL the time  then you should visit a doctor as that may be the only way to fix this type of problem    The second source of unhappiness can be equally persistent but is due to a problem with perception  A common example is being unhappy with your appearance  To be unhappy about how you look  you have to first put a high value on physical appearance  have some pre existing ideal of beauty and be rating yourself as uglier than your ideal  It is a good thing to care about how we look since we use looks to quickly judge people we don't know  But how much do YOU actually value looks when it comes to the people you spend your time with and care about  It is probably not at the top of your list  There is no reason to think it would be at the top of everyone else's  so perhaps you are overvaluing the importance of how you look  Additionally  your ideal version of beauty is completely subjective  You may look fine to others and this is the goal of putting time in to your appearance  so there is no problem here   The last thing that can lead to unhappiness is inaction  If you're in a bad relationship and it is causing you misery  the problem isn't going to fix itself  You gotta get out of there  Similarly  if you're single and in a rut  sittting around at home isn't going to fix your problem  Go out and meet some people  If you're upset with yourself for not eating healthy  change up your habits    In general when trying to diagnose some source of unhappiness  always analyze your situation objectively and ask yourself why you feel a certain way  Don't stop at "I feel ugly" or "I feel lonely"  Ask yourself why you feel ugly or lonely and keep going until you have a plan in place to fix your problems  If there is nothing you can do  you need to adjust your expectations to meet reality  this usually happens naturally over time  but actively accepting your situation can help speed up the process   Therapy helps here  If there is something you can do  make a plan and do it  Don't think about it  Everyone has different personalities when they're with friends than when they're alone or at home  so try not to overthink or worry too much until your appointment  Explain to your doctor and I'm sure they can help you more     Good luck  I practice mostly Vipassana but I try to do some Metta  I have a hard time forgiving myself so doing Metta is a challenge for me  If this was a job  I would blackmail the boss  it's painful when you can't rely on emotional support from your parents  i try not to bring any emotional matters to my folks because they're clueless  and i end up feeling worse when i tell them about something that's tearing me apart and they respond with the  weather report   i'm fortunate to have a few friends i can talk to when i'm in pain    You don't need to know what is wrong with you to seek help  Depression isn't necessarily every single day being awful  It can be being fine some days and then awful other days  If you're at the point where you're tired of feeling terrible and you've been feeling like a burden then yes  there are definitely professionals that help with that kind of thing  Mental problems are an enormous spectrum and incredibly common in the mild forms  There is no need to be a certain level of bad before you seek help  Happy New Year to you too  I just wanted to write this somewhere and I'm not sure where to write it  2016 has been one of the hardest years of my life  I got kicked out of ROTC for a medical reason  I failed an entire semester of classes and dropped out of college  I feel like I am a complete failure  I had surgery for my legs in march and nothing has really changed since then  My recovery is taking so long that I feel like I wont ever run any kind of distance ever again    It has gotten to the point where I cant stop and think about what has happened  because if I stop and dwell on school  or my career that has been flushed down the toilet I just shut down    I don't know what I hope to accomplish by getting all this out here   Thank you for the response     Things are hard though  '   I'm very sure I'm not gonna get through January sadly    I was so low before  Then I saw a great post on reddit depression where the OP said " I will make 2017 my bitch"  I nodded to this  I'm sick of feeling low  shit  unhappy  anxious  Screw it all  I will own you 2017 Hey there  20 year old girl here  I remember the anxiety of being 18 and needing to fix everything right away and freaking out about relationships  But  two years later  I've learned a valuable lesson  No other human being is going to make you happier than you can make yourself  And besides  What's wrong with being alone  I hope you think about it a little  Maybe learn to love your own company because for now  it's what you have  Not always going to be the case of course  I promise  But for now  breathe  Life is one big process  The process is happening as you read this  I promise that too     Happy new years   Hit the gym  save some money  move out  Even if you have to move out with a friend or an acquaintance you still learn something and you gain your freedom  Don't be afraid that if you live with someone you hate it will suck  I'm not saying that there isn't a possibility that it won't suck  I'm just saying it's worth the experience and freedom right  You'll meet some people  get your endorphins flowing from working out  and learn some real world skills  like how to find a place in society that may help you feel apart of something   If you wanna move out you have to make some changes to whatever lifestyle you're living that prohibits it  It's not gonna be easy either  You have to work for it  Maybe go out to an event  bar  show  social gathering of any sort  every couple weeks or so and work up from there  Meet some people  pick up some more hours at your job  and get in shape  There's a lot of simple improvements that if you make them habits can benefit you so much  The best thing for me when I'm dealing with my depression and anxiety is to realize that there is nothing to be afraid of and that the world isn't going to crash around me into a million tiny pieces if I make a mistake  If you wanna vent you can pm me  I stayed at grandmas for awhile too Decided last minute to skip planned festivities  Instead I made a pizza  watched Netflix    smooched my puppies at midnight  Much better than standing in a crowded club while all my friends kiss their SOs at 12   going home alone   depressed  Happy 2017  Fuck I was just gonna say this Alone in the dark  trying to sleep but my husband is in the other room yelling into his mic while playing Xbox  He didn't even bother to give me a midnight kiss  Felt really neglected but then my 6 year old came in and gave me a New Years "kiss" a few minutes after midnight  She should be asleep but I'm glad that she somehow knew I needed someone  I'm so proud of you  Hey  can you come back to this post  OP accidentally replied to themselves not you  I really hope things get better  If no one is there for you  then we are  damn it  Please don't  Well he came back  Pretty sure he's fucking wasted though  Awesome     Have you taken anything  darling  It sounds like you didn't have someone who suited your needs  There isn't any point on affecting someone else's recovery from depression by being so negative  If one doctor doesn't work you don't just stop going to the doctor  you find a new doctor  If you need someone you need to vent to feel free to pm me   2015 was awful for me  2016 was awful for me  and now I'm terrified for this year    Sadly a clock change does not change the mind  Every year it gets worse for me  2016  my 13 y o dog  who's my best friend  only true friend  who I spent 24 7 of the past year with died  I feel more alone and hopeless than ever  and its growing  so 2017 is already feeling pretty bad    Any death grips fan's in this sub  man I swear sometime's i just feel like nothing and there style and aggression just makes me like I can claw out of this hole  There music is very influenced by mental illness and has that chaotic feel but holy fuck it helps to listen to music as intense as alot of my moods when working out  How do you feel about writing down what you're too afraid to say  I find that that helps me with that  wish some people on this sub would understand that more  Being told to just play games to cope doesn't work when you remember how shitty video games are compared to other things in life  How come  darling  I was on a flight just two days ago  and halfway through there were some turbulences and the seatbelt signs lit back up  nothing unusual  But I started smiling like a madman because  as ridiculous and unlikely as I know it is  especially given that I'm a frequent traveler   the thought that the plane could at any point be on its way down  and I don't mean landing  and that it'll all be over crossed my mind  You really seem like a good person  full of love  It's so hard for me to fathom why you feel like you suck  I GUARANTEE you  that you don't   I'm sure you have a lot of catching up to do  but you have 27 days  That is plenty of time to get it all done  I KNOW you can do it  It won't be easy  but when you do finish it  the elation will be second to none   I can hear and feel your depression spewing that negativity  That's not you  I know  I know  I'm just a stranger on the internet  I don't know the full gravity of your situation  But again  I GUARANTEE you that you have it in you   I really hope you see it in yourself that you can do it  It's there  not the slightest doubt in my mind  You really are a pathetic waste of skin  i would answer the same  to be happy  a therapist i knew said his goal was not to be happy  but rather to live fully  maybe this is more realistic  and braver too  i find it easy to confuse happiness with pleasure and convenience  which do offer temporary happiness  but i find more enduring happiness comes in other ways  a soulful conversation  time in nature  music  things that cost little or nothing  i notice that if i'm not disciplined about doing what i know makes me happy  i'm easily distracted by what society says will make me happy  working  buying stuff  and being in a  romantic relationship  sometimes those things contribute to my happiness  but they seem to equally contribute to my misery  so  my resolution is to pay more attention to what makes me happy  and do more of that  You're not going through the same thing you shit heap  Now go laugh at rape victims like you always do  i would  but i cant organize thoughts enough to hold a conversation  sorry For me 2015 was the worst year and 2016 was damn near perfect up until the end  2017 just looks to continue this miserable path I'm on  Deep Who was  u Pizzachu1 mocking for being raped as a child  The one supplement with the most consistent effect for me is sarcosine  1 5 grams daily and you're out of depression within a week  sometimes less   I would like therapy  it can't afford it  And meditations make me nervous Mine is to find a reason to live  Because I honestly don't think I'll still be alive to see 2018  Do you have this  darling  What did you take  Well I'm sorry but your friends sounds like shit  Who does that  And I'm sorry that you feel like shit  Be careful with the drinking  try to keep track of how many drinks you've had  Write that shit down or type it in your phone  It may sound stupid but just doing it might help you drink less    I hope things get better for you  PM me if you wanna talk or anything The "this year is going to be better mentality" is really exhausting  Are you still with us  I hope you get the help you need OP  Hugs to you and hope you have a better 2017     It's not just pain   it's numbness  loneliness  sadness  It's no happiness  I don't want to avoid it I just can't take it anymore   I'd take pain  pain is good  When there's pain  there's pleasure  and when there's both there's life    The problem is when you just don't feel anything  Not pain  just a vague form of pity  and you're not sure why  But it's just always there  lingering  hollow  And it makes you feel hollow and vulnerable  like the smallest bump will cave you in   Never a bad thing to share and reflect I guess  For whatever it's worth  here's to a better new year   Hell yes  let's own this year  I'm here for you  what's going on  Hanging yourself is not an option   No self harm is   Call suicide hotline and talk to someone    You are overwhelmed  we all are Being able to catch yourself in the act of bringing yourself down with your own thoughts is the hardest part of fixing this problem  Now you just need to learn some new thought patterns to break yourself out of that cycle  various forms of meditation can help   Good luck  I hope you can find your reason to live  I didn't think I'd be alive to see 2017  but somehow I made it  although I can't say I've found a reason to live yet  Stay strong  This is such a weird goal  but one I so relate to  I work in a professional setting  I'm decently presentable  But something about my depression just makes it so hard to brush my damn teeth    I'm so excited for you that you get to have this "one small thing"   Is there any reason to seek help or get better  The primary aim of all living creatures is to maximize well being  Is there really any inherent value in that  Does anything have value  Does your depression and anxiety really matter  Nothing has value  negative or positive  until you attribute the value to the thing itself  Depression is neither inherently good or bad unless we deem it so  I find this somewhat liberating  I ask myself this everyday   Going through a similar thing  I think about her everyday it eats away at me but i still love her I am here alone too  Just listening to classical music  It always makes me go to a land of fantasy  D  I try to alternate weeks  one week I post a call for ideas  and the week after is when the assignment actually starts  I used to do this on Fridays but then accidentally it drifted to Thursdays  Had an awful suicidal 2016  Hoping for a better 2017  when a few minutes in  my girl friend said she lost feelings for me  Guess I gotta wait till 2018   No worries  Things can and I will turn around  I managed to fail 2 semesters and a summer semester and get kicked out of my mom house  I then worked for a semester and turned things around  There is always hope as long as you never give up  No matter how bad you screwed school up or even it feels like you'll never run distance again  The minute you doubt yourself  Any possible chance of hope is gone  Believe in yourself  you can recover  You aren't not a failure  You will come back from this hard time a much stronger person  You can do it  Never quit  Never stop believing   Yep annoying  From personal experience   alcohol makes you feel better when you're feeling  down  due to a certain incident  bad grade  relationship issue  etc    But if you're just having an overall  shitty  day due to depression  alcohol will   ONLY   make it worse  How do you know your ugly  Had an awful suicidal 2016  Hoping for a better 2017  when a few minutes in  my girl friend said she lost feelings for me  Guess I gotta wait till 2018   Had an awful suicidal 2016  Hoping for a better 2017  when a few minutes in  my girl friend said she lost feelings for me  Guess I gotta wait till 2018   Dude  I cleaned my room a month ish ago  not 100  clean  but def cleaner than before  for the first time since I was diagnosed  And it's still clean   its main ingredient  mitragynin  is an opioid  and as such its addictive  Because I don't like how I look  The loneliness is likely part of the depression  ANYTIME a person is contemplating suicide it has to be taken seriously  It can be scary to open up to others and tell them how you are feeling   You said you are afraid of telling your parents  your parents will be greatly relieved that you told them how you are feeling so they can get you help  If  for some reason they brush off your being depressed  please talk to your school counselor the day you go back to school   The school counselor is trained to recognize the signs and symptoms of depression and the counselor can explain to your parents that the way you are feeling needs attention   Depression can leave one feeling very hopeless  Please know there is hope and you can feel better  You are not alone   This is a conversation that needs to take place with your parents now   Oh  and the phone    phones can be replaced   You and your wellbeing are far more important than a phone     Hi friend  Its 1 04 where I am  I'm just checking in Wish I had the courage to take my own life and make 2017 be my last year but I can't even do that Had an awful suicidal 2016  Hoping for a better 2017  when a few minutes in  my girl friend said she lost feelings for me  Guess I gotta wait till 2018   Things will get better  is of course bullshit  Things can get better  is completely true   I definitely relate to what you've said  Only I wish I could find good friends and have success with women  I believe that if I had those in my life  I would be happy  And while reading what you said makes me question that line of thinking  I still stand by it  Which brings me to my question  because I feel this is what's missing   What do you want to do in life  What makes you happy   It's not like that  I've been in 73 hospitals this year  Its not like i've been here a few days  My illnesses don't have a cure If you haven't achieved it yet maybe you should make your resolutions things that would make you happy  That's what I've learned about myself   I need to become independent and live my own life before I can be happy  Also self improvement   Well shit  looks like you are in a really tough situation  You guys play games together and talk everyday  so I'm sure you mean something to her  you guys sound like friends    The thing is  if you can't stay friends with her without having strong emotions for her  then it might be best to stop talking to her  I know it sounds like shit but you can't live like this forever  You can't live loving someone for the rest of your life and having them not love you back  8 years is a long fucking time  but if you talk to other girls you'll either eventually get over her and find another girl you're into  Again  this probably sounds like shit  I was never in a situation where I liked a girl for 8 years but I was in a rocky relationship  and once I stopped talking to her after we broke up things started getting better  I was not constantly thinking about her  wanting to talk to her  wanting to do things for her  I just stopped thinking about her 95  of the time and you can too  It just takes a fuck load of time  but it's for the best for you   Love you too man  happy new year  Bout 40 sleeping spills so far and idk how many shots of vodka I know its hard to die from sleeping pills but im keeping mynfkngers crossed  Don't listen to those jerks  People who say to just get over it doesn't understand depression   Tonight this runs through my head 3 times per second   You could die right here and no one would know for over a week  I have no one left and it's starting to really scare me   Thanks for sharing  I have some Sarcosine on hand but have not yet experimented  Have you tried Agmatine  If so  how does it compare to Sarcosine  Personally  it has helped me quite a bit  despite the stubborn nature of my anhedonia   If you haven't already  you should see a psychiatrist    Dump her immediately  She bailed on you on a holliday to break the law with a friend  Fuck her  You don't need that shit  Yeah you love her  but you know what  You can live people who actually care too  Don't cut yourself man  you need a new way to express your sadness  No  it's not  At all  It's ignorant  disrespect and insulting because those people have no fucking clue what you're going through  If it was as easy as flipping a switch  then wouldn't those same people think you would've done it a long time ago  You cant just be happy because you have no idea why you're unhappy  Even if you did  you have every right to feel the way that you feel   I dunno how to get help I've been putting it off for a year now but I think I'll go and see one soon  thanks for reading  Description shows psychosis symptoms  Get help or you could loose months trying to march this off  Well thanks What exactly do you consider wrong about your appearance   It is an intrusive question  You don't have to answer if you don't want to  I was alone  Thank you  I'm glad you are still here man  20 pills deep and drunk is not a good thing  Seriously  It's a new year  here is to making a new start  Me personally it was the first New Years Eve in 25 years I haven't been drunk   You do deserve it  and I sincerely hope that things change in your favor for the new year  No one deserves to feel like they have no purpose  or a pointless life that they're stuck with  I'm rooting for you  man   Don't  Give  Up   Please don't First half was one of my best years and I grew a lot as a person   I don't know what the fuck happened but the other half was definitely the worst of my life and I'm not even considering outside factors   My mind made it horrible  this hurts so much do you really think she drank is there any chance she didnt  we have been in this relationship for two years Hugs to you OP  How are you under attack  Verbally or Physically  I hope God grants you the strength to continue and endure until you find the right path  None of my friends asked me to be with them for New Years  I'm visiting my parents for winter break  but even my best friend who's from my town is going to a party with my other friends that I wasn't invited to  Tonight was probably when I realized the true extent of how far I've fallen into depression  There doesn't seem to be a way out  I don't mean to make this about myself  but I can relate to your pain  You're not alone in suffering  even if it doesn't make your suffering any easier  Similar situation  I bought a house a year ago because I was frustrated with renting and apartment living  But probably only enjoyed it for a couple of weeks before the regret and anxiety set in  There are all sorts of issues with it  and I'm now certain that i rushed into it and paid too much  Almost every night I wake up in the middle of the night with anxiety about it  I have nightmares about it  It's become my albatross  I wish I could undo it  but I'm stuck now  I think about suicide too  You are not alone  I'm guilty of  2 and 3  But that's only because I've been through it   the heartache after a failed relationship is many times more shitty than what you're feeling now   Knowing you had it and lost it for whatever reason   You're just going to blame yourself even more because that's what depression does  whether it's your fault or not   You need to understand how depression affects you and others around you before you pursue a relationship   Learn more about yourself   Read more about the disease   Learn how it manipulates your thoughts and emotions   Only then could you have some control over it   If you learn about the disease you can teach it to your future SO   And they can help you manage and control it   Otherwise if you can't help yourself  it's not realistic to expect them to make you feel better any and every time you're down   I say all this with the hope and optimism that depression can be managed and controlled  Exact same place right now  20 and all   The women I'm confident around I'm not attracted to  and the women I'm attracted to are too good for me   I have this problem as well    When I was young  my mother was very abuse physically and mentally  I was bullied at school because my hair started falling out when I was in 1st grade  My best friend was a guy that would throw me under the bus every chance he got to seem cool to other people  I was a fat little fucker and I had problems trusting people  especially women  My depression worsened day after day  One day I decided that I had enough  I was tired of dealing with people  I was tired of trying to seem like a cool and good person  I was tired to trying to please everyone else  I said fuck it and fuck anyone that doesn't like me because I am going to live my life the way that I want  I am going to be the best person that I can be and I am going to get rid of anything or anyone in my life that gets in my way of being happy  My mom and dad got divorced when I was 10 and my dad got emergency custody of my siblings and I in 7th grade  I started drinking water instead of my regular 4 or 5 pops a day  I started watching how many calories I took in and started working out  I studied harder in school and started getting better grades  When I was living with my mother  I loved to figure out how things worked  I would sometimes break things just so that I could show my mom and she would let me take it apart  I know I shouldn't have broke things as a child   I started to try to build things and I messed a lot of stuff up  but I learned from my mistakes  I kept going  I got to really know my dad after my parents got divorced  I never got to see him much before as he was always working to provide for us  We lived in a little apartment for a long time until my dad built a house  I didn't have a lot at first  but I had my dad  I remember wearing my dads shirts that were way too big for me to school in 7th and 8th grade  I learned how to live cheaply  Buying nice clothes at yard sales for a couple dollars  My father and I would stay up until 12 or even 1 building end caps out of fiberglass for a trailer company that he worked for  We worked our asses off and we started to build something for ourselves  My dad like to fix wrecked vehicles and he traded many things for tools and equipment  Today we have our own body shop and we have cars lined up waiting to be fixed and sold right now  The only thing that I know to tell you is that you must find at least one thing in your life that you love and let it motivate you  Set goals for yourself  Find out what you want to do with your life  You have to stop living for others and start living for yourself  You must strive and work hard to reach your goals and you can't let anything get in your way  It's a hard road and it is never easy  There are going to be many obstacles and trials that come your way and you are going to feel like giving up  I can't begin to tell you how many times I wanted to just lay in bed all day and just be lazy  but I let the things that I love be my motivation  No one can do it for you  I know that things are going to happen and you are going to want to blame others or blame something for the failure or the sadness  but you must learn from the bad and use it to help you reach the good  It is not an easy battle especially when facing depression  I can only hope and pray for the best for you  I hope that one day you can find your happiness in life and I know that if you get motivated that you will  You are facing a battle that many people face  but you can do it and don't let anyone tell you any different  Lots of things that add up but the biggest is that I've already lost almost all my hair and I'm only 24  I did start shaving it which helps  but my shit hairline is still obvious and I just hate how I look bald  I grew a beard but it turned out to be super sparse and ginger  my normal hair was brown   I'm also  extremely  white which doesn't help the bald look   Even if there are people that don't consider me ugly   I  still do and I'm not sure that will ever change  Everything about my appearance is the opposite of what I think is good looking  Just hang in there  You can do it  It will be worth it once the side effects wear off  and they will wear off  The worst is usually only about a week  Maybe it is for the best  but i don't think i have a say in this anymore  I have an edging feeling someone else has confessed to her and she accepted them  I have a feeling that she won't be talking to much as much or even at all anytime soon if my suspicion is right  Maybe this is the best path for me to stop having feelings for her  after all  i just want her to be happy   I don't really talk to other girls  i am a pretty introverted person  when i do  i never show interest in them since all i can ever think of is her  it does feel like shit  I feel like time doesn't heal  only lets you forget  Sigh      You sound like a beautiful person  And I am not talking about appearance  but rather your character  You want to be healthier to help others  and that is something I truly admire in you  The world needs more people like you  I can't help but feel that people are becoming more and more isolated as time goes by  To those on here who live in the west  I just want you to know that it is not entirely your fault if you're feeling lonely  In the Western world  capitalism is the new religion and the workplace is the new church  except we go there to work and compete  not to bond together and worship  The free time we used to use for face to face socializing is rapidly being intermediated by technology  Our government's social nets allow us to rely on the state to take care of us when we need it  instead of our family  and so there is less incentive to have strong family bonds  Capitalism demands us to set out on our own and achieve material wealth so we can consume endlessly  not spend time with our family and friends  Of course you don't have to submit to this  but that doesn't change the fact that everyone else is too busy working or too tired to meet up  On that note  to those who are motivated there are still many ways to meet new friends  Good luck in 2017  What kind of shows are those  Take a nap  I've gone through periods experiences in life where I was absolutely  100  sure I was never gonna recover from    I was convinced that I had broken or was just cracked    And then I somehow made it out   The human ability to endure is actually spectacular   Now  If i just believed I could recover in the big picture  that would really be something  Fuck same and every birthday wish I make as well  I know how you feel  Getting help is of course the most important thing you can do for yourself  so take pride in that because a lot of people refuse help  Practicing self care is not something to just sweep under the rug  That is an amazing  brave step  You have to acknowledge that  Do some soul searching  What is it that you think will make you truly happy  Forget about having a decent job  women to date and all those other "norms" that equate those things to true happiness  Sure they're important  but what is going to give  you  drive and passion  What is going to make  you  ecstatic to live the life you do  I hope that you find it  Please  please  please  Don't give up  If it means anything  I'm rooting for you   Had an awful suicidal 2016  Hoping for a better 2017  when a few minutes in  my girl friend said she lost feelings for me  Guess I gotta wait till 2018   That's terrible advice   Count me in  I started hysterical crying because not only am I sick  but I just feel so alone and am depressed all the goddam time  I'm happy that 2016 is over  but I'm terrified of what this year is going to have in store for me  I'm not saying I want my life to be perfect with zero bumps in the road  but I so desperately need things to go easier on me  I need some good things to happen to me  I need good people to come into my life  promise to stay and actually stay  I don't know how much more pain  and disappointment I can take   My resolutions are to lose a bunch of weight  get a job  move out  and start HRT  which would also mean having to talk to a therapist   Surprise  it's the same one as last year  I really hope it sticks this time  I don't know how much longer I can go on like this   Oh  and on a less depressing note  I want to learn guitar and maybe write a couple songs    nods   I came off the drugs in '16 because they were doing me more harm than good    shit's been rough man   Never been to this sub before  so I don't know how y'all do it here  but I'm not new to the state of mind    at all  Same  I actually thought I was going to have plans  for once  but he decided to hang out with some other people instead   Just ask for help  no one truly knows what to do  but some people are there to help others get going in the right direction  I've been in the same position and the only reason why I'm still going is that I want to see what's next  It sounds cliche  but it's true  it really does get better  Pm me if you want to talk  I'm all ears   I feel ya man  Had an awful suicidal 2016  Hoping for a better 2017  when a few minutes in  my girl friend said she lost feelings for me  Guess I gotta wait till 2018   I wonder the same  I feel ya man  I love this sub because it's helpful to know people out there are going through the same thing  I'm an existentialist  which is basically just a slightly more optimistic nihilist  Nothing matters  but we can basically give things meaning ourselves  even if it's just bullshit  Yup  Today has been horrible   I used to get really crossfaded a lot  I would just drink a ton and then smoke weed afterwards  I did it because smoking weed after getting near blackout drunk made me black out completely and I didn't have to feel anything  Im not sure if you are in the same boat and if you're abusing drugs for the same reasons but this is what i did  I went through counseling through my school  and I was able to get medication through a psychiatrist eventually  The counseling helped and the medication  lexapro  is what helped me not feel like shit anymore  but I feel emotionless now  I don't know if that is because of the medication though  But the medication was totally worth it  Even if it did make me emotionless because now I'm not crying everyday and feeling like a complete worthless person like I was before  Sorry I sound like I'm ranting but I think seeking counseling or therapy would be a good thing to try  Talking to someone helps  Many attractive men are bald or almost bald  I understand you would prefer to have more hair  and I believe there are treatments for that  but being bald is not a deal breaker  I am not a woman  but honestly I don't think they care much    There are guys out there who look disgusting  ugly would be a compliment   are totally out of shape and don't even have that much money and they have beautiful girlfriends  I'm doing the exact same thing    classical and standards   Yep  6th year in a row where ive come to bed around 10ish and cry   Lots of things have been going on  Im unhappy with my job  teacher   im not the parent my son deserves  He deserves so much better  Im tired of everyone saying that things will get better  Nothing has  Im almost 31 and still live with my parents  I work 2 jobs and still do not come close to being able to move out   Im so fucking sick of this shit  I hope this year treats you well  Thank you for saying this   Because being in love isn't a long term cure  the depression will come back   It always does   And if you're not educated on how it affects you and others around you  the relationship will not work   The least you can do is read more about it   Get counselling   And just really work on yourself before you seek out a relationship  After the honeymoon period of a relationship wears off and you become comfortable and complacent with each other  you will find you are annoyed with many little trivial things that your SO does   At first you may think they are annoying and that they don't understand you   "Why can't they just make you happy "  you will ask yourself   "Shouldn't they know you by now  "  But really it's the depression fucking with you and you not noticing it  because you are associating the symptoms of depression with whatever you are doing in your life   So you will blame your shitty feelings on everyone around you but yourself   You will alienate yourself from others because they don't understand you and how right you are and how stupid they are   Depression warps and manipulates your thoughts   That's why I suggest really really working on yourself first   I hope with this post you will be motivated to learn more about depression and the causes and triggers and how you can avoid it the best you can   And you seeking a relationship and you actively working on yourself are NOT mutually exclusive  I'm not denying the benefits of a relationship   HOWEVER  if shit does not work out  which most likely won't for first relationships   the depression and emptiness and anger and nothingness is SO MANY TIMES greater than whatever you are feeling now  Happy new year's to you  Happy new year  I hope it treats you well    Great idea  I'm going for a drive  I've got a loaded 30 06 in the closet   One bullet in the chamber for me   I look at it from time to time but I'm too afraid to even touch it  Every year that I'm still alive is a bad year  Same  I'm pathetic   Just think  when you make it in life  and you will  I know you will  3  that you earnt it  You deserved it more than anyone else  You struggled through everything and still managed to come out on top  Yes  it's true that there are people out there how are in a better situation than you  how have more opportunities but that doesn't make them predisposed to win  to come out on top  Life is about adaption and how you react to the different contexts you are put in  Making it to where YOU WANT to be is the ultimate goal  you can't compare it with anyone else's goals  We all want different things and yes it's true there will be people who are smarter than you  more confident than you  come from a richer family  But like I said  you adapt  you figure it out and you take the opportunity  you take the chance and you prove yourself to the world  I come from a really rough part of the UK notorious for never amounting to anything  But I worked hard  harder than everyone else because I knew what I wanted and how to get there  There were people who were clearly way smarter than me  braver than me  less shy  more charming than me  But perseverance is key and I'm where I always wanted to be  studying linguistics   And if your parents DO feel depressed because of you  well  that's their loss       Stay strong  I'll tell you my story  maybe someone on here will be able to relate  maybe not   I've never been good at feeling close to people  I had a best friend for many years  over a decade  We met in middle school  and continued our friendship into our mid 20's  But he became addicted to drugs and alcohol and spiraled out of control  I tried to help him  I let him treat me like shit  I stood by him when nobody else did  I was his only friend  The only reason I stuck around as long as I did is because he was the only person in the world who I could be myself around  my true self  When I spent time with him  the world felt shiny and new again  nothing was impossible  and life was an adventure  Two years ago though he fell off the wagon again after having been sober a while  He started being cruel to me  really tried to tear me down as a person despite me being his only real ally and friend  I finally cut ties with him and told him to fuck off  Fast forward to 10 months ago and he hurt some people real bad while fucked up on who knows what  His trial is in a few weeks  He is pleading insanity  but it likely won't work and he will end up in prison for the majority of his life   Despite all of that  a day doesn't go by that I don't miss him terribly because without him I can't be me anymore  at least not around other people  I just spent the night around family and whatnot  and it left me feeling so drained and alone and wanting desperately to just talk to my best friend again  My current lineup of friends don't give a rats ass about me  Most of them only talk to me when they want need something from me  In the last two months I haven't bothered to start conversations with most of them since I'm always the one having to start the conversations  In that time the two people I considered to be the best of my friends have barely spoken to me  One of them has sent me about 5 sentences of messages  and 4 of those sentences were asking for advice on technology  This was someone I talked to daily and gamed with all the time  My other friend has messaged me maybe once in those two months  My existence is increasingly becoming a lonely one  Hi   I don't think anyone will read this  or really care  since this is mostly just a dumping thread for all of our emotions    I will probably say too much  and people will skip the long post   I am 20  female  I consider myself attractive and witty  I love my personality  I love myself  But do I    2017 has begun  I have now lost two SOs from an opiate addiction  I have lost my best friend from alcoholism  I have lost countless friends to prescription drugs in the past few years    I have lost interest in everything  I danced for 13 years  have always been creative and artistic  An excellent painter  photographer  cinematographer  always had an eye for art and design  I don't care about any of that anymore    I wake up every day at 1pm  exhausted by 6pm  can't sleep until 4am  Wake up multiple times throughout the night  If I don't smoke I'm plagued by nightmares  Just last night I watched my parents die in my dreams  If I do smoke  I'm numb to the world around me  and my grades begin to drop    When I am alone  the isolation cripples me  I'm left to my own anxious thoughts  worrying over things I can't tell if they're serious or not  If I should be worrying or if it's just anxiety  I can't tell    When I'm with people  I feel as if everyone is talking about me  Judging me  Then immediately feel like I'm conceited  thinking anyone pays me any attention at all  Why would anyone care what I'm doing    I lost 20 pounds this year  I don't let myself eat  any excess fat I notice is a shame  and so are the bones when I see them poking through my skin  Especially my pelvic bone through my back  or my rib cage and my bony chest    I don't remember what excitement feels like  Like I said  I am attractive  I meet guys easily  I have an awesome personality  I think  But when they realize how unstable I am  the extent of my anxiety  the never ending self doubt and exhaustion    they're gone  I'm alone    I'm lucky if I shower three times a week  Sometimes I don't get out of bed for whole days  Most times I just get out of bed and move to the couch    I wish I had a therapist  someone to talk to  My friends are tired of listening  my problems are my own and they shouldn't be burdened with them  But I need someone to care    I tried to kill myself on October 20th  My roommate called the cops  they took me to the ER  where the psychiatrist asked me why I was feeling suicidal  and when I began to explain  he told me he didn't understand why I would feel so upset over little things    Because of what I look like physically  no one will ever take me seriously  No one  I'm expected to be happy  I don't remember what happy feels like  The week following my suicide attempt  the person I was seeing told me that I needed help and that he couldn't be the shoulder I needed to cry on    I keep telling myself that my happiness is in my own hands  I can be my own shoulder  I can make the difference in my life    I wonder if it's okay to admit that's not true  I can't do it on my own anymore    I'm so tired  I want to sleep  But I don't want to wake up in this world    I'm sorry for this long post  I left my journal at home    Please let this end  I just want to sleep  I just want to stop crying  I just want to live throughout the day  I don't want to feel like brushing my teeth is an obstacle to face  I don't want to drown anymore  Please  I have no answers    Please let it end  You can tell us your story  if you want  Nobody is here to judge you  God it fucking sucks  especially today when you realize how you've been alone like this for your entirety on earth  I just wish I could find one special someone to spill my heart out to  or something  I feel like we all have to go through this alone and we'll never see each other so all we have is our thoughts and the things we read  keep it going my man    happy new year buddy  all the best to yoou  don't neglect your teeth of all things  that shit wont heal   lovely to hear you're taking care of them again  and if youre doin it for a month straight then i assume you'll keep on doin it   you should    all the best to you man     i should probably add that i am actually chuck norris  for real  so pay attentention to what i say  keep goin down the path you're on   it's a good one  HAPPY NEW YEAR Thanks  I don't really know what undepressed people do that I don't though    Love you back  happy new year  It's not that bad     if you can afford it  Maybe return it if you can  Pretty similar  I'm usually drinking hot tea or ice cold water  watch a movie catch up on a tv show  or read on my kindle   Reddit all day  I doubt you've had the best tasting meal on the planet  I think 2016 was at least tied for if not fully the worst year of my life  but the way I'm trying to look at it is like this  I've been through the hellfire  All the worst that could happen felt like it did  there was death  heartbreak  anxiety  depression  fear  and pain  and 2017 literally can't be worse unless everyone else I know gets hit by meteors  Literally  So with that in mind  I'm trying to be hopeful  I'm trying to look at it like the physical therapy after a horrible car crash or something  it's still gonna be hard and it's gonna be uncomfortable and take a lot of adjustment  but overall  it's going to be healing I hope  It's hard but I hope it's going to be a better year  I'm emotionally numb  yet on some level there is what I can only describe as a sort of hatred or contempt for seemingly everybody  I can't actually feel these things as feelings per se  What I experience  rather  is this urge to criticize  I don't have the emotional energy to express that urge  to organize my thoughts into words  but it's always there  this running list of all the things people are doing wrong  all the things about people that are wrong  Sometimes it's closer to the background  It hasn't been today  Start by leaving the toilet    That's for sure going to make you feel worse  Put the bottle down and get some water   2017 can be the year it turns around  You're life is precious and unique  Stay on this Earth  you got to nothing to lose  Life your life the way you want from now on  follow your dreams  take risks  have passion  live   Love you too  stranger   Honestly  I just come here when I'm depressed because giving others advice makes me feel better  This sub helps me more than I could ask for   I've been feeling really hollow and empty the past week  The past 6 weeks I feel like i've just stalled and it's unbearable at times    I wish I could just turn my mind off when I want to  I feel the same way   ive basically prayed that I'd die for Christmas for the past 4 years  and when that didn't happen I'd hope it'd be my birthday gift  I've been stuck in that spiral of "please don't let me live to see the next       " for what feels like ages  I sure hope something comes along for you to help you escape this hell we live in  wish you the best friend  At 12 00 I cried tears of happiness because for some reason I felt strongly that there was a chance things would pick up this year  At 12 05 I was slitting my wrists because all my old friends were sending me pictures of them being together and enjoying life  Fuck everything  Be yourself  Yeah OK  which one   Get off the alcohol and any drugs  they destroy everything  stop drinking and taking pills it's all bullshit  trust me  All they do is make it worse  especially when you're trying to quit     Because you still have hope left in you  You want to be happy  It's still possible  It might take a lot of work  but you can do it    Oh  and you're awesome   Try inviting them to hangout next time  Sometime you have to grasp the moment and not let it come because it never will  Are you okay  I've not found that to be the case   Though that's not to say that working hard is any better  Rather not be rejected Wait five years  9 times out of 10 you'll be happier later  You just have to stick around through the rough   I'm out at a bar around random people tonight because I'm afraid of what I might do if I'm not  I've never had some story tale kiss you at midnight situation but I'd like to  But I recall many a night watching the ball drop while I was by myself  Now I'm just by myself in a room full of people  Maybe next New Years  Good luck next year to you too    Yeah  but that's like saying "enjoy being stabbed while it lasts because you won't get stabbed forever"  Oh definitely shouldn't put it off if you haven't tried it yet  I started dealing with panic attacks early last January  Started taking meds in March  Meds definitely help   Oh for fuck's sake  I have no other way to say this other than it'll only hurt more if you don't try  Look if you keep doing this  college will  no  it is the same except you have freedom  Thank you  wish the same for you  I'm sure that there is a real number out there  But I came to say that everyone is at some point  Everyone goes through struggles and tries to hide it  Be kind to everyone because you never know what's going on in their lives  Your not the only depressed one  There are many others  They just express it differently  Don't know what to tell you  I'm kind of in the same boat  Earlier the thing I thought was that the only thing that would fix my pain and my problems was a bullet  So I decided to go be around people and went to a bar  So here I am  We've made it so far  We've made it another year and another chance  That's something right  I hope you didn't go through with this but if you did  godspeed  but I really hope you didn't    I hope you find on the other side what you are looking for   If you wake up today PM me  please   Let me know you are ok and we'll talk  yeah  I take meds for depression and anxiety  and I liked it cause i was better  But now they just make me feel worse and weak  idk how to explain it Understandable  But when your 60yo  and you look back at your life  I guarantee you'll say "I wish I asked them to hangout"  Glad I'm not the only one  Why is it so hard  It's like a sign I know when I'm really feeling better  when I do  I will start to brush my teeth  It's almost funny  Anyway  keep it up bro  Or ma'am   I can relate with all u just said  I wanna get rid of my brain too   I fucking hate depression  I had a similar experience today  I asked people to hang out today for New Years  also a senior  and was turned down by everyone  then found out later people I had asked went somewhere else to hang with each other Literally the only reason I'm still alive is my parents  I'm not sure how they'd feel if they knew that  But they are the only reason I'm still here  My mom and my dad would have to identify my body  And that hurts me so bad to know  My mom and dad already had to bury one child  I don't think they could survive the loss of another one  So here I am  And they have no idea   Good job bro  we're proud of you  Do people get texts like that  I haven't gotten a single one either  Meaning isn't meaning unless you believe in it   Telling yourself "X is meaningful" is way different than actually believing X is meaningful   And that's why existentialism is bullshit   To the extent that it means anything  it's just a post hoc rationalization for doing what you were already motivated to do in the first place  I'm fucked up so this is hard   I still haven't seen Magic Beasts and Where to Find Them  Or Jessica Jones  There's a donut place I still want to go to   I'm down  SpookyMulder 1697 If you were motivated to do something  you aren't a nihilist by definition  This is exactly how I feel Heard   But there's a video game I want to play coming out in June  And there's the new Jumanji and Wonder Woman movie   But I feel like I'll still have the same shitty job and shitty life  Yay   I'm just scared and I don't know how to get through this   Sorry about that    Love is a really nasty thing sometimes  It's awesome that you want her to be happy  but yeah  of course you're not going to feel good at the same time    Hey  I promise it does get better with time though  I'm pretty introverted too  and I am horrible at speaking with people I don't know that well  I got lucky  and I was able to get a job that allowed me to work with other people my age  Eventually in a year or so I went from being almost completely mute to being able to have conversations with people on a regular basis    I think I sort of get what you mean when you say you don't show interest in people when you talk  I had the almost the same feeling as well  When I talked to people before  I did not give a fuck about them  They saw a movie over the weekend  Okay  They like to play the piano  Okay  They enjoy going on hikes during breaks  Okay  But eventually I started asking questions about it  I had to fucking force myself  but I did  You watched a movie  What movie  Oh you play the piano  What kind of songs do you play   You like to go hiking  What's a good hiking trail around here  Eventually  I realized that people have interestings things to say  But not only that  you get to learn from these people and apply the newly learned knowledge into other conversations as well  Oh you went hiking on this trail  I heard about it that trail blah blah    Sorry that I'm ranting my ass off right now  I just wanted to share that I was shit at talking  but now I'm alright  And once you start talking with people it got a lot better for me    I understand that this shits hard especially when all you can do is think about her  But with time it does get better  And hey  maybe with time it lets you forget  but maybe that will heal you along the way     And maybe with enough time  you can think of the happy memories you had with her without getting sad   Happy New year bro I came here hoping other people would be checking in  Nice to know there's others doing the same   Happy New Year  Please don't encourage people who violate the community rules   Happy new year      I know how that feels    people are shitty sometimes Happy New Year   That was a great read  thank you   Does anyone else feel like me  I don't want to have fun and "maximize pleasure"  It's bullshit anyways  Dopamine to eat and have sex so people can stay on this goddamn planet forever  Sometimes I can convince myself there's a God but it's been getting hard  especially coming off of the prozac     I know deep down now all we get is oblivion  You work your ass off  repopulate  and die  For what  Why should I have to live knowing it's all meaningless   Much love man  3  I don't think most 13 year olds' "emotional issues" comprise contemplating suicide  Suicidal ideation is a serious issue and anyone who mentions it should be taken seriously  Any books  movies  or sources you recommend to get more insight on this   I don't know what you're going through but that's exactly how I feel right now   mitragynine  Yes  it can cause withdrawals if used daily for an extended period of time  but so can antidepressants like Effexor and run of the mill drugs like caffeine  And every prescription antidepressant  and while we're at it  caffeine  has a higher risk of toxicity than kratom  Zero deaths have been attributed to kratom in isolation  whereas I see people who fatally OD on Xanax  SSRIs  and alcohol every day at work  often in combination but frequently by themselves    Nothing is without risk  But by and large the benefits of kratom greatly outweigh the risks for many many people  Kratom has been a godsend for me and so many others  It's a tragedy that the DEA has been running a full throttle smear campaign in a desperate power grab  Please check out the American Kratom Association to learn a little more about this amazing plant   Happy New Year   I wish it made me happy all the time  I'd have a reason to drink what I do  GOod luck buddy  Have you considered that it might just have been a misunderstanding    Besides  you have Internet  so there is lot of ways to entertain yourself XD Might be side effects  Worth mentioning to your doctor about it and possibly try something else Had been going great since the summer  School had been keeping me busy  i got back together wuth my girlfriend and was doing ok  Idk what happened last night    just feeling pretty hollow now  Meh  Happy New Year What happened here   o O Are you regretting anything specific  or is it just a general sense of regret about nothing in particular  those are always fun    I'm sorry you feel this  I have it too right now and I can say it's not fun at all  If you need to vent I'm here   and hope you find some solace somewhere They're all being deleted ahaha I don't know why  it'll happen in the next few minutes   EDIT  Seems this is the only comment not deleted haha  Hey man he's just trying to see if the person is still there  Don't bash him for asking a question  6 for me yay  Hi  We can talk  This happened to me too  First half of the year I contributed in starting a company  got a better job and started dating  Second half  well my scumbag brain sabotaged every effort I made at anything and I finished the last 3 4 months feeling lost  suicidal and alone   overall  worst year ever even given the new job etc    Happy new year my man  I'm here like we survived 2016  Give me a medal  shit   Honestly man I feel like we were unlucky enough to develop defective brains one way or another  I'm like that defective product of nature that should be dead but medications are keeping me alive  They fill the void    Find something to obsess over   Find something that you enjoy and can improve upon   Learn an instrument   Go to the gym  Buy a multi player online videogame   Whatever you do try to actively enjoy it    Keep trying to add variety into your life and what you like will stick   Yep  losing contact to 3 people who are close to me means that I have no one to express my feelings to anymore  That much regarding "friends forever"  I feel you  Having same exact problem here too  Trying to fix it but no solutions to be seen    why the late reply  Most people are fine and happy that's why  Also times have changed there's less purpose in life we are cogs in a machine making money for people who own things  we are useless to society if we die then no one will in society would miss us we would get replaced easily  you have to fit in even if you don't  keep wearing that mask and don't you dare take that mask off you don't want people to be disgusted by you when you are already so alone  The world generally seems to become a less hospitable place for us  If you're gone  I hope you finally find peace on the other side and I'm sorry you couldn't find it here   If you're still here  I believe that would be a sign that you're stronger than you think and you're meant to tough it out for as long as you can  I really hope its the latter and you're still around  As hopeless as it seems  your story definitely seems like you have a lot to live for  even though the negatives seem to block out all of the positives  Ahhhh yeah I was feeling the same way then I got a text   Turns out it was someone messaging me literally at 12 02am to ask me if I can fix their laptop    Lol     Oh well  What can you do when you live in a shoe  Read it  Don't apologize  You came to the right place I think  I'm too terrified to tell my parents  The one person I told  he blew me off  I think I'll keep it to myself from now on   Right there with you Maybe this will be worth nothing but watch six feet under  you reminded me of Keith  It's funny  Usually I take bars because they they make me happy  Lately they haven't been   I just care less  Care less about my life  Guess I need a new drug   I'll take it one day at a time  Hopefully you do the same  Maybe we'll be in a different sub next year   I see you OP  Hugs to you  Seriously  Life isn't easy  You know how you feel no one else  Take a breath  Study and tests are not the whole world  If you are here talking about it you are open to help  Go to a professional  If you do have an imbalance no amount of talk will fix it entirely  Medicine works and it could change your world  I'm pulling for you and praying as well  Start 2017 off right  go get tuned up    I'm feeling pretty close to what you described there too  It sucks that people close to you aren't taking you seriously  I think it's so irritating when people say that people should have a reason to be depressed  it just doesn't make sense  Like  come on people  it's an illness  Do you need a  reason  to have the flu or something    I hope you start feeling better real soon     and your post didn't seem like a mess to me   Fuck 2016  You are  not alone man  My 10 year old cat died this  year  I couldn't wait everyday to get home and see her and now she's gone  wtf   Exactly   I have this place  a little road divider that I pass on the way to home from work that I always think of speeding up and crashing into  Pass it everyday  but the thoughts still there  My sister died in car crash  Maybe it's tradition   Edit  sorry  I'm fucked up  My point is  the stuff I do makes me care less and less  To the point where I don't care about my well being  Don't care about my body and what I do it or what happens to it  So be careful   Look into The Gift of Imperfection  Parts of it feel corny but it's got a lot of good writing on how to break out of this cycle  learning to accept yourself  and being content with who you are  I struggled a lot with a lot of constant self deprecating and being too hard on myself and it helped a lot  Yep  being around negativity really does worsen your mood  That's why I hate the negative circle jerks that sometimes show up  makes me start thinking that way alittle  Maybe try to keep the mood lighter  change subjects  I laughed the loudest who'd have known  T T When I was younger I wanted to kill myself   I had my suicide note written and I was ready to go   I kept putting it off because killing yourself actually takes more planning than it seems   Then one day I got a message from a guy that I fell for 4 years before  and I stuck around because he made me smile and made life feel like living for even just a moment    We've been happily together now for nearly 10 years and have a little girl together      There's nothing actually to be gained by dying  but there's a chance to gain something by living   Why would you want to die miserable rather than take the chance to find something worth living for   It all sucks right now  but stay strong and don't deprive yourself of the chance at happiness  For me 2016 was a decent year  depression free for the most part  Except for its last ten days  These ones were painful  disheartening  and they continue being so  Every joy I got during 2016 have suddenly been ripped away from me  leaving me in desperation  The feeling of emptiness and hopelessness came back full on   2013 was the overall worst year of my life  But 2017 has got the worst start thus far  It's not just me    Congrats  Maybe I'll work on it this year  Same  I love dark humor so  i upvote  My birthday's not in march but besides that I could have made this post  I really think something drastic might happen soon  I can feel myself getting worse and becoming much more comfortable with the idea of suicide on the bright side you don't really keep in touch with people from highschool when your older    plenty of time to make some weird friends in college and have weird fun stories with  Blow my nose  lol  and then just lay down and sleep   Alcohol only works with social stuff and making me laugh a bit more at comedy stuff like it's always sunny if it would make me happy I would be probably be an alcoholic lol  oh what i'd do to be like you  I feel like everything is and would be awry for me  that my pain would pile up and become unbearable  there is always  r SuicideWatch too  Lets hope none of us needs any of these services though I commented in another thread of yours with a recommendation but also wanted to ask if you've tried meditation  I felt the same way for a really long time   You don't know when things will change  so just keep going    I will Same here just waiting to turn 21 and drink myself to death   Thank you   I will continue the meds and hopefully I'm able to feel better  Happy new  year   S2 is when things started to derail  in a good way  I still hope to see dennis go absolutely mental or something haha  I think it will work because I got reminded of a breakdown where I was telling her my honest feelings and we both cried and I did feel better afterwards  Other times when I keep stuff in  I end up self destructing  So you've enlightened me I think  Happy new year  Yup  Same boat  No good advice to give  Honestly I feel like I'm not so nice anymore  Too many people left and I gave too much so there's not much left  I wish we as human beings didn't crave connection so much as we do  Life would be easier   Agent 47 disagrees with your views  Anything any of us can do  Like reminders or anything  What more can i do  I am forced to keep going  I have to live in misery  Discord or rabb it are pretty good for virtual hanging out New year is hard  Bring around people didn't make it better for me  but it was safer to be around people   It hasn't been fun but it's been diverting  which is what I needed    I love you too and I hope you sleep well after the night is over   2017 used depression   it's super effective  Sorry had to do it  I am sorry you feel that way  This is very familiar   I hate my job  but I panic on the weekends because the structure is gone   Then I feel worse because I "should" be having a good time on the weekends   I'm trying to impose some structure by going to meetups  Like today I went to a board games meetup in the afternoon  if not for that I probably would have just slept all day    I read every word  people are listening  people are reading  and we are here  Obviously there isn't much I can do with my lack of intelligence as I am young  but I found that ranting is always a good way to relieve stress  it helps me even in a dark time  So what I'm trying to say is tell your story as often as needed  even if you feel like a hindrance  you aren't  and we are reading  you aren't talking to yourself  I wish you the best through your dark times  Hold on for as long as you can  Apparently from what I heard the grass is actually greener on the other side Call 911 and please get the care you need since all you will probably have done is fuck up your liver severly if not treated fast  So yeah unless you want to life on a dialisismachine the rest of your life call them they will help you but you have to be fast and don't wait even longer   I've been at it for hours  sure is wonderful             'sarcasm' I guess i agree but I also feel like it'd be way easier if people just were a little bit less shitty on the whole  Like if I could just find some cool stable friends or a boyfriend that is sane  i feel like it'd help my depression by preventing it from going soooo crazy  And that's easier than finding solace elsewhere  but maybe I'm just romanticizing   Yeah I'd easily rank it as the worst year of my life as well  I feel like I won't try to go through the next year Honestly quitting a job that makes you miserable is a great idea  It's better to find something else first  Makes things less stressful  Things might not be awesome after  but they'll improve marginally if you get out of a toxic environment   The idea of "love" as we know it today is a by product of romanticism anyway  Living in misery with the chance of being happy   I wish you well Did you write a note  I go home to my family's place every Christmas New Year's  A whole bunch of my extended family shows up  aka 20  people in one house    They stopped asking if I had a boyfriend about 5  years ago  They also stopped asking if I have had crushes recently  Or if I was looking for a boyfriend   Basically  there's an unspoken consensus that I'm a spinster  Or will be a spinster    In a way  I'm glad they don't say anything  because it hurts enough to know it   You can try looking at r latestagecapitalism  I believe they have some reading material in their sidebar   what did you do  Adding to this I also doubt you have seen the best places this earth to offer  go travel and combine it with trying out local cuisine and trying food so you can find the best tasting meal on the planet    Maybe you are interested in photography  Take a camera with you  or drawing  Get some supplies and sit in the nature while you draw paint your surroundings   Like camping  Get a tent and stuff  get out and see the world  As crazy how it sounds what is there to lose you may have to save for a bit or have a some debt but it can be a great chance to find a renewed taste for life    I do reccomend using something like airnb for places to stay since hotels can get pretty damm expensive  Maybe  I mean  I don't really think so  It's that life is inherently  without meaning  but it's possible to give it meaning  Even if it's not much  I can do something no matter how small the impact   Well that's one fear I hope you never conquer  my friend   Good job  Thank you for sharing  It's not always as easy as it may sound Med compliance for BP is super important in general  but even more so with lamictal   Messing around with its dosage and starting stopping is a way to increase the chances of the serious rash side effect   Lamictal is a wonder drug for a lot of people  but believe me   you don't want any part of that rash   Be careful  "I really have a lot of love to give but it feels like the universe doesn't want me " Yep  well said  Wanting it badly that it hurts  No good advice also  but I'll just second to what you said  We all want to be loved also not just one way    Good luck with your therapist visit   Not OP but I've tried both agmatine and sarcosine for that lingering anhedonia  I didn't get much from either  but I don't think I gave them a proper trial  Would you mind sharing your protocol for agmatine  Happy New Year  Sometimes being with people who make you feel alone is just as bad as being alone   Yeah I relate I feel like i'm living my life for media right now like it's the primary reason for living   but hey it keeps me going    gotta see what's next on the flash or how kingdom hearts will end or what the next elderscrolls will be like  Also let's hope the next justice league will be good I want to see how this gritty version turns out  Well the question would be what do I have left   And the answer is not much  I recently got a cat so I can't kill myself but that's the only good thing I can see   That's existentialism  Dude I was asleep alone in my room at 11 35 pm  Feels bad when I woke up 6 hours later   If your looking for a sad message then your going to find it    I see a lot of monsters    Fuck man I dunno what to say but your post is really calling to me for some reason    I guess just know it's completely your decision  Nobody can stop you but everyone wants to  In the end it's all on you  Hope you make it through the night man  Just know there's love comin from somewhere  To live a stable life and to be happy  I'm really sorry you feel so down  I don't know what drove you to such hopelessness that you believe life is not worth living  However  help is out there if you seek it out   even though it may be difficult to reach out to someone when you feel alone  People care about you and tough times in life are easier to get through if you have someone to let you know that you're ok  Anyway  please update so we know you're ok     Funny  I want to die bc of my parents agreed   Glad there is someone here for me  Yes  I never thought I would die alone  If you're able  try replacing the cutting with a fuck ton of push ups  Those things hurt like a bitch  even when starting out with a small number   And it helps tone the body slightly when you get that urge to cut  I did that for a while  doesn't work for everyone  however  Hey just listen  Don't get carried away    If when you get a chance ask your psychiatrist directly  it's best to get this information from the horse's mouth  so to speak  I just got out of the psychiatric hospital yesterday   2016 was my worst year ever  and I realize I have a two year cycle but fuck  Thank you for the well wishes and I am optimistic this year will get better  it has to be better than the last  right   I'm going to be 41 and finally diagnosed as manic depressive disorder with anxiety that I will have the rest of my life  One of my goals was to reach out to people more and participating in this sub  Seems fitting  I'm trying to not climb back into my hole where I couldn't even leave the bed    why does "depression" have it's own subreddit  that is literally the saddest thing ever    I guess it doesn't matter anyways    BTW  I'm joking   A subreddit for depressed people should be their moto xd I was the driver with a passenger  I didn't even feel fear for him while this was happening   something I'm not used to   Normally I care way more about other people than myself   Month ago I told myself I would jump off the bridge on the 31st  Fucking ass nugget I'm still here  As someone whos been single his whole life  I feel ya  Got to watch my co worker who I've had a crush on have a NYE kiss with another co worker who I guess shes been talking too  Life sucks most of the time  but there are those few brief moments of happiness that make the bad times tolerable  So  look forward to more of those good times this year and be happy to say "Hey  I survived another year "  I'm terrible with stuff like this  I hope it helps you in some way  Well  I did it  She said she is interested in being friends  but she'll tell me if that changes to more  At least she was straight forward  I feel like eventually the weight will be lifted from my shoulders  but all I want to do right now is cry myself to sleep  OP  to answer your question  First  I have had MDD for ten years now  Second  I do the same thing  I see something shitty about to happen and all I can think is "oh boy  here it comes" and when it happens I'm like "See  told ya "  I read an article that people with depression are better in high stress situations because they can cope better with the reality of the outcome which may and can be bad  So you're not crazy  but you might be depressed  I was too tired at the time I posted that comment and I did the maths in a wrong way  I have a hard time brushing my teeth when I am depressed too  Good job  Ah well for sure I have depression then   my whole life has been shitty medical events for the past couple years   I won't go into detail but every time something shitty happens I just accept it xd  The part of me that makes me think I dont have depression is my ability to move on  Generally I don't linger on shitty parts of life  I just go forwards and escape into things I like  This black and white diagnosis is pretty retarded  Life is almost never you either have it or you don't  Everyone I know who has extreme depression will linger on terrible events for months at a time  I just sorta move on   like my life is a video game or something  Do you know how long the wait is  Hang in there  I know that sounds cliche but seriously you got some Internet buds here  have a happy new year   No matter  I hate brushing my fucking teeth and do it like once a month  and have since I was a child  Ever since this asshole dentist  he nearly killed my ass when I was 10 or so  I then been afraid of going to the dentist and as I grew up I eventually got over it   I'm 26 and black and gay  All my front teeth are rotted  I'm saving up for full mouth extractions dentures veneers with no anesthesia one day lol    I don't have bad breath though shockingly    When you don't have that many friends or family or no lover  Why the fuck should you care about your teeth  I'm facing a similar problem to you  I just isolated myself and pushed everyone away  The reason wasn't simple  but I  did it because I thought everyone close to me didn't care about me at all but for themselves only  I still have time to think about it since I'm only 16 but I think in your case  you can always make amends with your old friends and make new ones who genuinely care about you  That's always an option         Yea I think you're right  You're really good at reading into things  o  Whether or not my lack of emotion is a good or bad thing is something for me to decide I guess     Well it sounds like you may have a low setting of depression  you gotta level up son  If you still care to wash your ass and do shit you like you got noob level depression  People with legit depression don't even get out of bed for days  Don't clean themselves  don't do a damn thing except eat and wallow in their misery  What happened  My crush didnt invite me to a party Does she know you like her  and even then this isn't the end of the world bro you'll find someone eventually  I believe in you Things that are easy aren't worth anything  P sure their life night be easy but there's a reason people who have everything handed to them are unhappy    your health was taken from you  when you get it back it will mean much more to you than it does to a person who's never had it taken away "Deep in earth my love is lying  and I must weep alone "  Meant alone  Not saline in the title  Yes she does and she only see's me as a friend  I can't handle it  I want to end my life Hey don't kill yourself over such a small matter you'll have time to talk and you'll have time to talk about your feelings it just takes time you just have to be patient I can't t tell you how much that resonates with me  What happened to my emotions they're missing   I was so  mentally  close to ending it late November  but decided to spend one last holiday season with my family  Holiday festivities may be one of the few things that brings me happiness anymore  My family actually gets along during Christmas time  I wanted to stay around for one last Christmas so it wouldn't ruin future holidays for them if I ended it during the season  Now that it's 2017 I no longer want to kil myself  I am still morbidly depressed and especially sad to say goodbye to my family's rare cheery demeanor  But I can't end it  I just can't  I was so  mentally  close to ending it late November  but decided to spend one last holiday season with my family  Holiday festivities may be one of the few things that brings me happiness anymore  My family actually gets along during Christmas time  I wanted to stay around for one last Christmas so it wouldn't ruin future holidays for them if I ended it during the season  Now that it's 2017 I no longer want to kil myself  I am still morbidly depressed and especially sad to say goodbye to my family's rare cheery demeanor  But I can't end it  I just can't  I don't know  but it seems that the more you love yourself the more people around you tend to notice  I've never had a relationship  but that's alright  maybe it's not my time and perhaps I need to better myself before someone will like me   To anyone reading this  having depression is like being a diamond in the rough  Being depressed is horrible  it really is  but it gives you a unique perspective on life  If you can power through this you'll become one of the most beautiful people in the world   I love all you guys  I wish I could make you feel complete  but that's something you have to do yourself  Make 2017 the year you refine your character  I believe in all of you  I know it's hard to be left by someone important to us especially if we are depressed or sad most of the time or just going through a rough patch  But it is also essential that we focus on ourselves and find what makes us happy or entertained even for a while  Try to talk and go out with a friend or a family member and just talk to them about it   or not  Or you could even find new friends  I hope that all will be well for you OP  Don't lose hope   It's gonna be a year of major change  dude  Hang in there  this is gonna be one wild motherfucking roller coaster of a ride  And I'm ready  Me too  Thank you for your kind words  I hope so too    Good bye  I hope you got some pleasure from this fucked up world  yeah the cycle is quite frustrating  thank you though     Hell is individual to each person  you can disagree all you want but you can't deny that in OP's world he probably is in hell  You're an amazing person  I'm glad you're doing well  the primary reason to care for teeth for most of us is to avoid having them extracted  dental pain can be excruciating and having them taken out is also crazy painful  and super expensive if you have to have them surgically removed as some people do  you go through a checkup every six months to a year to avoid having to spend thousands on a dentist yanking your teeth out   Can I just trade body with any female no matter which skin color or orientation   Have you seen Sense8  It's on Netflix  Pretty good and also about different people with other perspectives  I believe you can do it  I want you to have a good year and if you need support through the rough times  hit me up through reddit  Your brother in humanity is all that I am  Yeah and the worst part is your suck in this body for life  This is all you got in this world  There's no choosing  it is what it is unfortunately  I know  I'm black and gay too and so depressed about it  I'm scared my life is going to end very soon in an ugly fashion and I'll never find love    I don't know if you're christian or not  but I pray to god that my life will be better someday and it gives me hope   I'm not gonna recommend you watch some hollywood pop culture shit either    Thanks  this was a pretty nice thing to wake up too  I've been pretty good lately about just focusing on today and doing whatever I can to make me happy but people in my life  family  often ask like what's my plan or whatever and think I'm just burying my head in the stand but I don't think they understand if I focus on it for too long I convince myself I'm going to get trapped here and stuck in this minimum wage loop and I can't get stuck here  I won't  I'm not really one to cave under social expectation to do something so most of the time I don't really care that I'm a Virgin but idk I get lonely sometimes   Somedays I just stop seeing the point  were all going to keep trying but for what cause  Were choosing to live in pain with no promise of it going away  Then I'll wake up the next day in a positive mood  I still agree with everything I thought the day before but i don't obsess over it  I've never told any of my friends the way I feel I usually just make up some dumb excuse for not going out or doing anything  part of me misses them but the other part really doesn't  and just wants to be alone I really really related to this post  My depression started in college  like you I consider myself attractive and funny  Attracting people isn't hard  it's the keeping them because of the mental illness we have  I hear what you are saying  I hear you when you say even professionals don't understand  All I can say is it DOES get better  Take baby steps  you don't have to conquer your life in a day  a week or a year  Do ONE thing a day  That can be anything  Wash the glasses  pick clothes off the floor  just ONE thing  I wish I had better advice  people on this sub have really good things to say  Just know that people read what you wrote and we get it  Really get it  You aren't alone   There's no reason for any of this  I don't get why we are even alive wtf is this shit  It's all about how much you can personally take before giving in to the endless dark void of mystery  I'm right on the  cusp right now  I totally get it man I'm in that same place  I can't decide if I want to continue on in this weird world or not  I get the same thing sometimes  Don't feel embarrassed  i'm sure they will understand what you were going through    I'm sorry man  I am in a similar boat  I've just realized you can't pick who you are in this world and whatever you get is what your stuck with  Either you learn to accept yourself or give in and end it all   Shit man  we can talk  I've had depression since I was about 15  I'm early 30's now  I try so so hard to not be depressed  I clean my house  go workout  walk my dog  but it's there all the time  When they call it he black dog that follows you around I get it  that's exactly what it's like  I go through the motions but get mostly no joy out of anything  I don't remember being excited  I'm scared of everything and hate  although I do it  leaving the house  I don't understand people who WANT to do things and meet up with people  I want to sleep forever  It hurts so much she post snapchats off herself at a house party  I can't fucking take it   I read the whole thing and I'm in a similar boat   same  i need to as well You just have to be strong these things come and go  r notababyimatumor   well done   How awesome does it feel to have reached that goal        r frashmastergland   I wish I knew  It definitely is something that is a common in depressed people    It is an area that I have to actively focus on making sure I do  Having found a really good dentist has made it so much easier because I no longer have an excruciating time at the dentist  Maybe it's dental technology that has changed  maybe it's attitudes that have changed  But oh my gawd   finally finding a dentist who can do a simple scale and clean for me without needles  Life changing  So it's this little bit of motivation that helps keep me on track in this area  Now if only I could find the motivations to keep me on track in other areas    It's tough  waking up to be forced into festivities  but you're right the people who need the wishes are actually those who are struggling the most  Change is constant  and yes sometimes we can't see it and everything looks bleak and dark  I'm guilty of this as well   But one way or another it has to end  I hope this year is easier than the last for all of you  Yep  Fuck ugliness  Hey 17 here too  in the same boat as you  I think a good first step would be to potentially be kinder with yourself  that's one of my goals   Don't worry about resolutions and all  because improvement is constant     At 17 we lack the overview that comes with age  and it often feels like our actions are a lot more severe  The way you feel will change  and you don't need to make huge steps every day  some days you won't make progress  but on average eventually there will be improvement  I know at this stage in life everything feels so crucial  but I'm sure there are many people like us  who have gone through this same situation and managed to turn out well     My birthdays in March too  want to talk about anything  at 12 00 i was with all ym friends and they told me they were all goinghome after hanging and at 2 00 they were all at some party wihtout me     i felt so horrible You'll find it   2016 was the worst for me too  but cmon bro    2017 will be great  Everyone can do it  so can we  I tend not to post on the younger folks' threads  as I am sure my negativity likely won't help them out much  People like to say that things get better  but that's really not how life works  you know  Chances are  the thoughts spiral downwards until you are forced to put up walls to protect yourself from the pain and nagging thoughts  And through this  you become more jaded  more cynical  more empty as your walls begin to suffocate you in the truth of your hollow existence  You tell yourself you put up those walls to protect you from those outside influences  but in all honesty  you are protecting the people around you from you  from your scathing anger  loathing  and negativity   Just food for thought from a mid 30's fellow  Maybe this year  you  will  be    lower   Thanks  Nice to hear someone else's opinion on the matter  Lately I've felt a little bit better  but it still kicks in at times  and makes some of my days just depressing and sad  It's kind of funny actually  how life either is on top or the very bottom of the bowel  But I want to say thanks again  it felt great actually being able to speak out to someone about it    I wanted to go to sleep too but then all the fireworks and noise    And fuck the world that makes people with brains like ours need to feel lonely and isolated  The world can and should do better by us No problem  they just do that to be huge trolls but don't necessarily understand the consequences sometimes  I hope you have a great new year  Oh well  this is hard i know  but you have to take a detour  First of all you have to find at least a few things you just like and enjoy  cultivate them to the point where they can make you feel okay  After that you branch seek for new things in same or similar categories  untill you find something that can be used during a party  Hey  Unfriend her and just focus on yourself  It will hurt less one day  trust me   Wow    This really isn't the place to be a troll  Move onto another subreddit  please  I'm so confused  Anyway  happy new year  Your message was really nice  made me smile   wishing you all the best  3  Who do I blame  Is it my fault  I can't help but feel like I failed  Does never tragedy come uncalled  Sometimes  including this time  horrible shit just happens  I don't want you to hurt yourself worse by thinking this is somehow your fault  A million small realities came together to make your reality  which is shitty right now  and I'm sorry    I have no reason to believe that I'm worth anything   You're worth a lot  What would you say if you saw a stranger saying these things  I think you might say something like "of course you're worth something  everyone is " And it's true  On top of that  I'm deeply touched by the amount of energy you've put into how to best support your family and friends  considering you have so little energy yourself  That's huge    That's not failure    If I could  I would give you a standing ovation right now   I unfortunately have been somewhere similar to how you feel  and it's really hard  You're not alone  I can see how hard you've been fighting and it's amazing  I hope you can see yourself the way I see you  That's awesome  As someone who also struggles with mundane tasks due to depression  I commend you for making good on your goal  I would message the mods  At least one of them has been trained to work a suicide hotline which is desperately needed  I'm so glad to hear you're doing better     i don't mean to be that guy but just so you know  it's  u  for users and  r  for subreddits  you're awesome  happy new year  great idea You're not worthless  It's really hard for depressed people  or anyone with a lot of baggage  to reach out and make a strong  clear connection with others  and I'm so sorry  This is a lot for you to go through  But it's not because you're worthless  I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that if you're young  it's because everyone around you is sorting out their own baggage  It's amazing to me how much kinder and gentler the world has gotten every year since leaving HS  Please do everyone a favor and bring all of your pets to a no kill shelter  they deserve better than you  Oh I'm glad to read that  you too  I didn't get any either  but I didn't send any    so I don't think I deserve to be upset about it  I plan to make 2017 about myself and my girlfriend and we are going to build our lives up by only focusing on the positive people in our lives   Cheers to 2017  keep your chin up  I hate when I am having thoughts like these  and I have even acted on a few of them  What I did to help reduce the risk of hurting myself is adopt emergency measures  such as ice cream or my favorite tv show   In one sense  maybe your friend chose to try to include you and remember you even though they were out with other friends     But I understand how it can sting  My girl's best friend was in town and wanted her us to come out but we are broke  and I'm kind of afraid of going out to the crowded nightlife places on Saturday nights  let alone NYE  So it wouldn't have been a very good time anyway  I'm sorry to hear that  I honestly don't remember the last time I had a "good year"   But then  I haven't had "bad" years either  I've just been numb for so long that I barely even remember the years   It's like I'm standing in a movie scene where everyone around me is moving super fast and i'm standing still in the center  and somehow no one notices the person stuck in the same spot for 20whatever years  Thanks  I was looking at the anatomy of the brain to find the part of my head I should shoot before finding this place  I think it's more the idea of this person  It could as well be someone physically different  But it's the image or the idea you had of her  At least in my case    Turns out this person was just another one who uses people probably without even knowing it  The kind who works by interest and wants some attention when the SO isn't here  Basically those who are not honest but probably don't do it intentionally  if you know what I mean   How do I return it  I'm with you  I'm not doing 30  I'm done  I wish wouldn't be to scared to kill myself  Today I woke up and just thought "Why I am fucking alive  Why didn't I finally just kill myself  It's only getting worse and worse  etc "      But I don't wanna hurt my parents and my best friend  she visited a few friends and I didn't want to destroy her day with being all sad    And I'm still here  writing this shit  living this supid life  I'm so busy with not killing myself that I don't have any energy left to improve my life  I could do so much more  but I just    can't    Whatever  whatever  I hope you have a great 2017  D That's great  Do you have a dentist  It's pretty great to keep up your teeth hygiene and have the dentist commend you on a good job as well  It's a great feeling when a professional tells you you're doing good so you know you're at least doing it right   I struggle with brushing daily myself  Sometimes i go a week without washing my mouth at all  The depression can be SO crippling on the simplest things in life   I have been trying to make it work by increasing the time spent in the bathroom when you wake up  98 3  of the time  you need to take a piss  You're already in the bathroom  don't leave until you brush  Brush as you pee  even   I often sit during my morning piss so I can do all that  plus a little Redditing and check my email quick   Anyway I totally get the struggle and I'm proud of you  I'm sorry you haven't had any responses and more sorry that I don't have any good advice to offer   I just wanted to say 'wow' what a great girlfriend  or even just great person you are to be so understanding and want to be so supportive  I really hope you find answers you're looking for  I am all of those    There's no competition for me  I've already lost  the thing that worries me about that is that you don't just "get put on a different mood stabilizer"  that's a whole  thing  where you try something for two weeks  work up to a dose  try that for another two weeks  spend another two weeks moderating the mood  and then if it doesn't work you start the whole month two month cycle over    should i really worry that much about the lack of blood work if i'm taking a lower dose of a med that i've been stable on for years   It's not like they really mean it  I mean some literally type one standard message and send it to everyone  I literally got one single message from a guy I haven't seen in 4 years and forgot he even existed   Thank you  Honestly very reassuring to hear  I've got a few friends with various mental health issues so I've learned a thing or two about how to not completely suck  but I still feel a little lost sometimes  HUGS  Its okay  we got your back  Be glad that you still have goals and dreams  Follow them  Hi  I'm new on this subreddit and yours is one of the first I've read  I have to say  if your therapist doesn't take you seriously  find another  An aspect of depression is that little things have a huge affect  I've been dealing with depression now for several decades  on and off  and have been on sick leave since last May because of depression and anxiety  What you're describing are pretty typical indications  especially the losing interest in hobbies and such   My therapist tells me that I need to do those things regardless of whether I "want to" or not  doing them will slowly rekindle the interest and the joy that they bring  Hang in there  And find a therapist that takes you seriously  I tried scripting to see if I could figure out how scripters think and see if I could learn how to beat them  It made the game a lot less stressful when all you do is press spacebar or c and v  You lose sense of the toxicity in the game  but it  also killed my dream of playing League competitively  I realized how dreadful of a player I was without scripts so I quit  At least you can still cry  I've been alone for so long I'm longing for it    not the loneliness tho  Paradox I know  That's awesome man  That and a daily shower help so much  Invest time in yourself  You're worth it  it's an on and off type of thing  sometimes i dont do it becasuse i feel like i dont deserve it Masturbate  PRN meds and a whole heap of distractions  Touch your dog and you're toast you little shit They will understand when they're older  I think this sub skews more towards the teenage end of the spectrum  I don't even know why I sub here as a mid 30's guy  I have nothing in common with people here  Really  it often makes me feel more alone because I can't give a shit about video games 99  of the time  I've been thinking a lot about loneliness for a while now  I think I worded quite well in a recent comment too      One thing I believe we all have in common is a sense of aloneness  Whether this manifests itself as loneliness in everyone  I'm not sure  But the way we see and deal with ourselves is different to the way we see and deal with others  and the way we see other people see and deal with each other    I experience the world only through my own eyes  I can only think with my own mind  When I pee  or get out of bed  it's only me doing it  Nobody else  Feeling sore or tired is only done myself  I can't feel your pain    When I talk to someone it is a fundamentally different experience than when I see someone talk to someone else  For example  I might talk to Steve and Paul  When I talk to Steve or Paul  it's me talking to the "other"  someone separate from myself  There is an element of aloneness present in that  I can't see what they thinking the way I can see what I am thinking    When I see Steve and Paul talking however  it's different  It's now two "others" talking  It's different from when I talk to Steve or Paul  It's more connected  It's more connected because they're the same in my experiences  they're both an outside entity  Something of which I cannot experience life through  This means I look at them as more connected together than I am with either of them    I'm more alone than the other people I meet  but they're more alone than me  We all share this common aloneness  this sense of loneliness  And we can experience it together    Coming together doesn't remove that feeling  Might make it easier to cope with  I'm not sure  This is just what I've been thinking about as I become less bitter and try to reach out to people more     I think it also causes a bit of a vicious cycle  When you feel lonely you want a connection with other people  So it makes sense that the "cure" to your loneliness is company  But company doesn't change that fundamental aloneness  In fact  in my experience  group company can make it worse  By directly seeing Steve and Paul talking  you experience that sense of difference and enhanced aloneness    Company then enhances your loneliness instead of helping it  So now  feeling even more lonely you start to think something is wrong with you  Other people have such strong connections with each other  it's different to how you connect with people  "What's wrong with me " you start to think  "Why can't I get close to people "  And it's not like they don't like you  nor you them  You just don't feel close to them  There's a distance    The way I then see it  the answer to dealing with loneliness is understanding that fundamental aloneness and dealing with accepting that  How do you do that  Good question    I think it's easier to do sometimes than other time  We all have moments of weakness    Don't mean to too my own horn but I feel this understanding of loneliness has helped me immensely both in regards to myself and others  There's nothing wrong with the person surrounded by friends feeling lonely  nor is there anything wrong with the person almost entirely alone not feeling lonely  or vice versa    This just made my year Oh my gosh  I didn't even think the reason I "forget" to rush my teeth might be my depression  That or I just don't remember  An anti depressant combined with therapy works well  To assume that only one thing is a cure is a grey area in mental health   Happy New Year to you too  Rob  it's ok  I appreciate it anyway I guess at this point all we can really do is put our head down  charge forward and forget our feelings until it gets better  That seems like my number one option right now I wish I could cry it hurts so much having everything holed up inside but you can't let it out Detonate a a bunch of nukes right on top of Yellowstone to trigger its supervolcano sending the earth into another ice age from all the ash blocking out the sun or something idk  I don't have any friends in my town to compare myself to  However  I did spend New Year's Eve with my wife  She is divorcing me  Before midnight she told me that our separation is only a legal requirement and that otherwise she would be going straight for divorce  We went to bed in separate rooms not having seen the new year  Tonight Reddit was my special someone Good job  Maybe you could reward yourself with something that doesn't cost anything  Like a walk in the park  or you could check out a museum you haven't seen before  If you're into that sort of thing      I brush my teeth in the shower  If you're gonna be standing there for a while waiting for your hair to get wet or leaving conditioner in for a minute  might as well brush your teeth while you wait  I just want to give you a hug right now thank you   I feel like this almost all the time now  I guess the only thing I could suggest would be to try to force yourself to do something out in the world  The only good memory I have of the last year was forcing myself to go to a concert  even though I have no friends to go with and I wanted to just skip it and retreat back to my room  I surprised myself by actually feeling excited and happy as a result of this  and the feelings carried over to the days after the concert  For me at least  going out to do something helped me a lot in feeling more connected to things  I understand to being alone in surrounded by friends  I felt it before being all alone  The thing that I don't understand is when they are praising the aloneness they are complaining about being alone by surrounded by people  Well  don't stay with them then  It's not hard to be alone  Happy new years to you too  Here's to hoping 2017 is better   thank you so much  if you need someone to talk to you can always hit me up as well  im on reddit quite a lot  I wrote a comment explaining my understanding of loneliness that I think might help you if you're interested in giving it a read  here  https   www reddit com r depression comments 5lb631 id rather be all alone than feel alone in crowd dbv5l4h      I can't tell you how to stop hating yourself  but I can tell you that I used to hate myself and was in a bad place in High School as well  After High School I gradually became less bitter  made jokes about how great I was    then the jokes gradually stopped being jokes  It seems for most people it gets better with age  It doesn't for everyone  but there's always hope there     I can't tell you how to deal with loneliness or depression  I can explain loneliness as I understand it and hope that helps  I can recommend therapy to deal with depression  Otherwise  again  those both often get better after High School  High School is a messy place full of teenagers with messy hormones  It can be hard     I can't tell you how to keep your friends either  But I can suggest you look up things like the book "How to Win Friends and Influence People"  or the youtube channel "Charisma on Command" and think about how you come across to others  The way we act  even subtly can affect how people perceive us  being aware of that and changing even minor things  Like saying 'I don't mind'  instead of 'I don't care'  can make drastic improvements on how you come across     One more thing  I started to feel much better when I stopped caring about being more invested in the friendship  relationship  whatevership  Oddly it made me both more and less invested  I invite people to do things  or start up conversations with people just because I want to  If they don't want to  I don't mind  I give friendship out as I want like a gift  not expecting anything in return  I think people often WANT to be a better friend  they WANT to be there for you  but they don't know how      You say you're fat too  I'd suggest you change that  Not even to stop people teasing you or anything  Fuck 'em  Plenty of fat people are incredibly popular  But you've stated that you hate yourself and have low self esteem  I believe losing weight will be a step in the right direction in that regard  Keep it simple  just replace soft drink with water  Or  if replacing it altogether is too much  just drink a glass of water before you have any soft drink and you'll drink much less  Gradually replace your bad dietary habits with good ones  By 2018 you won't even recognise yourself     You're young and you want to improve  you're gonna do fine  Same  She is completely dependent on me  She needs me for even the most basic of needs like water  If I killed myself  would anyone find her in time  If I sent out a message asking someone to take care of her  would they end up "saving" me  If I could convince my wife to take both dogs when she moves out  I think that would be best for everyone     Oh man I can relate to the not cool bit so hard  Like at this point I know I'm weird but it's like  it's kinda lonely being the weird one  Ive tried fitting in  but at somepoint it just looks sad trying and not succeding  so lately I've been doin my own thing for the most part  At least my cats don't judge    This is too real  Wow  Well done OP  You did good  Something about your tone just makes me think you're on a good path  I'm optimistic you'll have a good 2017  I've been dealing with bipolar for years as well  and slowly getting better and better at managing it  Best of luck to us both    I do see where you're coming from  the idea of just leaving the group if it makes you feel worse is definitely simple    But  while it's a simple concept  it IS hard to be alone  When you're lonely you crave a connection with other people  To bring yourself to leave people and go back to being alone is hard  You have to pull yourself away from what you want  back to what you want to avoid  Hey  first off I just wanna say I'm sorry too hear your being bullied  people just like too pick on people who are different  It doesn't mean anything is wrong with you  really nothing is  just that you don't fit the norm  Just keep being yourself    I might not be able too help very much honestly but here's my 2 cents   If it wasn't for different activities high school would of been much worse for me   Admittedly  I only really had "school friends" in high school  but still it helped  By activities I mean things like sports  band  choir  and things like that    It helps to distract yourself from loneliness sometimes  Find something you enjoy and do it when your feeling down    Idk of a way too improve your self esteem really  Maybe just try working out and getting in shape or just accomplishing some achievement     Also I think the key too making friendships really making the effort to hung out in person or at least talk on the phone or something    I hope this helps even if just alittle  I wish you luck  Right there with you  My life dramatically collapsed  it's now significantly smaller  The holidays are a great way to measure how things are going  They are not going well  This is probably my last Christmas  Ok  sad to hear     Zero labido I don't mind really  I'm not in a relationship anyway   I've hard about withdrawal  but you only have to experience that when you go off them so unless you do that often it's not that bad  Brain zaps sounds horrible    Which two are you on  Which have you tried  Any particular one which worked better or worse   Thanks for taking your time to answer  Hope you can get better   I went to bed at 11  woke up at 7  Checked phone  no text messages   You should watch a good TV show  It's a great waste of time and its certainly better than watching random videos  I recommend The Wire or The Sopranos   More people than you'd expect  Even if they don't know how to show it  I should be apologizing  not you  It seems you're concerns are definitely warranted  Sorry  friend   Actually women are more prone to depressive episodes than men   Well  I suppose you're right  Thank you for that  thank you very much  It can most definitely be helpful  Don't be afraid of trying out a few therapists until you find one that you think works for you  Bad therapists exist  so do ones that you won't get along with  Find one that works for you though and they can definitely help you work through your problems    The last part is key though  They can help you work through your problems  they can't work through your problems for you  Nobody can do that     And one more thing  I didn't have friends pretty much all through High School  I had a group of friends in Primary School but I was always a little isolated from them then  and in High School we drifted even further apart  The most socialising I did was in an MMORPG  in which I had the closest things to friendship I'd ever known at the time  Things changed a lot after High School though  so it can definitely get better with age  Idc  I hate this body  And it wouldn't matter anyways   And women are at least more able to ask for help  But nvm  I don't want to start anything here  That's why it's a practice  Good luck  Just at night or when you're tired  When I was depressed  whenever I got tired any negative feelings I had were amplified  A friend has expressed the same thing  Even now  I'm in a very good place in my life  when I'm tired I can get more down than normal    If I eat and sleep well this effect is mitigated  Eating a generally healthy diet and sleeping consistent early hours  Always getting up at 7am  going to bed at 10 30pm  and no screen time past 9 30pm  All leads me to feeling more energetic and better  As someone who just hit major dental pain from not brushing for years  you will definitely thank yourself  I've had kidney stones  too  and I really don't know which is worse    Congrats for sticking with your goal  Of course not  Please take this day for yourself to recover  Try not to be so anxious about calling off either  Have you ever tried meditation  It's been the only thing to help me with my anxiety and depression   Yeah man  I can get 99  right and all I see is that one wrong  it consumes me and drives me to madness  I am not 'happy' unless I see something wrong with myself  Hey look its totally normal to feel scared to lose your parents everyone feels frightened when that thought crosses their mind but let me tell you that you should try focusing on now rather than the future try spending more time with them and make them happy and death is not the end you'll eventually reunite with them again but just spend time doing what you love and with people you love and dont let that thought ruin your days  your parents will be safe and so will you just keep telling yourself that  I agree with you  But if you don't understand me then don't underestimate my pain  When you do this  it's just growing my pain and growing my despair   this was for them  not for you  Glad too hear that you are still alive  but sad to hear that you're still suffering  May I ask if you know why you are in such a dark place  I would give you a gold if I wouldn't be broke  On a similar note I think  unfortunately you can't always change the circumstances  in a short period of time   but you can your attitude in which you might find solace  but that's a slippery slope  While it also is illegal to even live outside in lots of places  let alone hunt or fish without a permit  Not you in particular  but people often seriously say "oh you don't like society  Go live in the wild then " meanwhile the lifestyle society forces upon people far pervades that    Hell   they just made it illegal in Florida to have a home not connected to the electric and water utility companies  No off grid living in Florida without paying a private corporation for the privilege  Take care of yourself  The labido thing isn't a big deal to me either  but puts a strain on my marriage    I have been on about 12 drugs  so going off them can be a big deal  I think it took me nearly six monthes to get off of lexapro   I am current on imipramine and quetiapine   In the past I have been on  Paxil  celexa  Prozac  lexapro  bupropion  sertraline     I think that's it     I haven't noticed any making any difference whatsoever   Probably the best thing has been exercise  particularly running  but I am injured right now and can't run   Hope this helps  I used to get this while running  Using an elliptical  which gives your body some momentum  helps  while exercising   I like to sleep but I don't sleep well Yup  And yet you want it so much  Such a vicious self deprecating circle   Aw I'm so sorry   but you're not gonna through this alone  Every time I got my heart broken  it made me a stronger person  so I'll be praying and hoping your 2017 will be better after this day   If this is a symptom of an illness it's unlikely to improve on it's own  I don't know how old you are or where you live  but here in the UK it's relatively easy to see a doctor anonymously  I believe the cutoff for when they can't tell your parents what you tell them is 16  If you can't see a doctor anonymously you should consider explaining your situation for full to your parents in order to get help  Hey  I wish you a very happy new year    Congrats on 3 5 months sober  I too surprisingly stayed sober for New Years  I'm tired of drinking away my problems    Also sorry for all the loss you have experienced this year  It seems like one of those years that's just filled with so much death     people around here passing too early  too  I just want you to know that if you can keep a sober and positive ish attitude through all that  the only way you can go is up  Keep your head up  Know an internet stranger is proud of you  The betrayal from your gf will stop stinging and you'll find a girl that actually deserves you  And hopefully it'll be awhile before you have to attend another funeral    All the best for you this year       Thank god I'm not the only one struggling with such a mundane task  I'm so happy to hear that you managed to brush everyday   you really deserve a reward  well done  2016 was the worst year for me too  It was the year where I finally broke  after years of holding on  Instead of fighting against it I finally gave up and let it overwhelm me  So 2017 will be worse and worse  The longer 2016 went the worse it got for me  I probably won't be alive for 2018  Or even the majority of 2017  Who knows  Who cares   Well hello I hope you're feeling a little better today  The suns shining for the first time in a few days here  It's cold  but nice  The type of winter day I enjoy   Sense8 is great  Did you watch the Christmas special  And I think season 2 comes out in a few months   Just to add  below is an exact description of how I feel but missing a few extra thing   You feel low  like really low  you've never felt this way before you feel like nothing could ever make you happy  nothings going your way and everything you love leaves  you feel like your life is a constant merry go round of the same shitty job and the same shitty routine with the same depressing faces  you feel alone  no matter what anyone says to you about love or life it's all empty words going in to an empty shell of a man that's been worn away at for years  no one cares  not really  they say they do but at the end of the day when it comes to them or you they always choose themselves over you and you know deep deep down that you'd chose them over you now and forever and no matter who it is they're this way  so what's the point  Why keep going round and round when things don't get better  they just get worse  the government don't give a fuck  family means fuck and and no one wants me  why not just end it all and get off the merry go round and stop the pain  I'm not talking pain as in sore headaches or cuts  I'm talking a pain that's unthinkable a numbness from deep down and swirling of the mind like water draining down the sink forever and ever  a never ending feeling of aloness and just bluntness that no matter what you do  what people say it never goes away  things you know  your mind says  that will make you happy it doesn't do it  it just won't work the numbness is still there that empty black hole of a void that can't be filled   Ok thanks for your reply  Yeah I've worked out before but I also injured myself and then stopped so I know how it feels like       I certainly felt better than now when I worked out  but I didn't really feel   satisfied  Like I was still tired and negative and stuff like that  But I have a stationary bike in my little student apartment which I will try to use a few time every week from now on  At least that's what I promised myself      I think it's sad to hear that meds are not making any difference for you  I'm probably gonna try it anyway because I really feel like I'm about to just give up  But we'll see what the Dr says   I know plenty of people who swear by their meds  so no shame in trying  3 Do it  The first step is the hardest  but it feels so good  It's not going to have a simple easy answer but keep at it  I really hate keeping up on my health  I just don't FEEL like doing all the little things    Treat your body like it's a car  Gotta do the maintenance too keep things running   having fillings done as a child without anesthetic ensured i brushed my teeth every day    that shit is so fucking painful Of course there are other men out there who are gay and fantasize about black men  You just have to go out and meet new people   I recommend you to use a dating app  Everything becomes easier because you can match with someone else who is also interested in you    Whenever it's at night for me  probably because I'm alone and stuck with my thoughts around these times    Not yet  I will watch it this evening  I've been trying and I've had no luck  Most people who match me unmatch me before we even talk     I've felt some of the same things  It's probably been a year since I've made my parents or anyone else proud  And I wish my opinion of the things I do wasn't just a constant thought that I'm making more mistakes      But instead of giving yourself a time limit  just give yourself time  You don't deserve to give up on yourself or be given up on  It's easy to see where you are now and look at the future as being the same or worse  but change happens whether we like it or not      There's no way to predict time  even for people who seem like they have it all together  You'll find a chance to change things one day OP  and it will be on perfect timing  Stay strong     Same here I can somewhat relate  I'm not sure what to say here  I'm a bit drunk  but you struck a chord in my heart there so I wanted to say something   I'm a white gay male who is spending this New Years alone  Well I did  I'm in Australia so it's the night of the first for me   I did get to spend time with a good mate and have a nice time but on the way home today I was surrounded by drunk 18 year olds  It was so in my face being surrounded by beautiful young men in tank tops  I dunno  just incredibly aware that I haven't even been kissed in 3 years  And they say your 20's are the prime of your life    So having recently been reminded what I am not anymore and having had body issues most of my life  You have my sympathy  Possibly some understanding and a friendly person to talk to if need be       I hope much has changed for the better in the past five hours   X Same here  It's like a coin flip  Except both sides of the coin are tails for suicide   you get an espresso machine  you prepare espresso a night before  you put it right next to your bed to be drunk in the morning     Slept forever  Wish I could go back to that  Got a call from my sister  otherwise I'd forget I existed   Yep  All I've been thinking about this morning  Only thing keeping me alive is my crippling anxiety   The benefits suck and it's every hour of every day  The closest thing I can find to a vacation is a fifth of gin   Couldn't even drink alone because my most recent bender has fucked up my stomach too much to hold down anything other than water   Therapy is the best thing you can do for yourself  You need the closure  You deserve to be able to live a happy life without refressing into the emotional trauma that you have lived  Remember that yiu will try to fight it and deny it as soon as tou start as your current state  not necessarily desirable  is the one you are comfortable with and you will try to keep it  Good luck and have faith that you can beat the anger and be a happier person    You sound like a very sweet and compassionate person to me  and I'm sorry for your loss      I know when I was 17  I had a bf and friends but only a couple of friends  They saw me go through a lot with depression and anxiety and it really does put a strain on relationships  My Mom was pretty strict too  and still is  I'm 20 now   She's still overprotective and it makes it harder to do all the things my friends like to do      But when I was in high school  I talked to her about the problems I was having and really just explained how I felt as much in detail as I could  We had a few disagreements but she did understand and loosened up a bit after that     Plus  I realized that it wasn't just the things around me that was causing my depression  it was a chemical imbalance  It's sad that not a lot of younger people realize this until later on or until it is too late     Without the right amount of chemicals in your brain  it's so much harder to deal  even with counseling  If I were you  I would talk to your parents about the way you're feeling  no matter how you think it might turn out      Also  see if you can get an appointment with your doctor and explain these things to him  It sounds weird  but they will help you  My whole senior year was one of the best I remember because I was on the right medication and I made friends a lot easier because of how I felt       Love you OP  stay strong          You need professional help  not a subreddit   Met a girl online  now I think she's looking to date or at least fuck some kid who added her off my friends list  Never even met her but it's still got me down that someone I was hoping to at least go on a date with only acknowledges me when she's asking about a guy I barely know anything about outside of the fact that he used to be a junkie   Glad you're not depressed anymore but I don't think that's what the army is for  Same here That is great   D yeah   shame I can't apply for US army     but whatever the aussie army does i wont be bored and depressed anymore Same  Lets hope we are wrong  I will try stay optimistic for 2017 Yes   I'd rather kill myself violently in front of my friends or family  Once I drop out of college I am ending this pathetic life of mine   I don't either  How can he like the pain of someone like him  If he believes pedos are oppressed why mock urgeless  He doesn't respect real pain but wants to call himself the vicitm   It's no big deal  there are hundreds of different meds  If the ones you're on aren't doing it for you  tell your doc you want to try a different option   Wanna go for a coffee on the 5th  That's good  I think once you enlist  you'll find some sort of greater purpose and it'll help you find your place in the world  Good luck to you    I've been on meds off meds been to psychiatrist   Like I just give up and don't care  i started to learn how to code   Sounds like my ex   It is the depression talking but also he recognizes he needs to do this alone   Men I think are different and feel they have to do it alone  whereas women are more open to talking to others openly  My ex contacts me every so often and I think he is working on himself and he wants me to know that  So I always try to support him by encouraging him but I never contact him first because he wants to do this on his own   It is very very hard but I want to respect him and his wishes   I still love him  but he has to do it on his own because that is what I heard many times  Good job  OP   3 I'm proud of you  OP   People don't realise how much effort it actually is to have personal hygiene  Yep  it's kinda cliche  I think  but I always feel like an eternal observer  It's like I'm trapped in time and I see things again and again and I don't even want to live them  I'm just staring at it  No    When you don't have that many friends or family or no lover  Why the fuck should you care about your teeth   That's definitely how I feel about personal hygiene a lot of the time  Who gives a fuck if I don't "look representable"  when I don't even leave my house   But  really  we only get more sick from not having some level of hygiene  Yeah sure I'll go for a coffee  thanks  I arrive in Dam around 1 30pm i know python and a little of c  and java   One step at a time  OP  It may seem like a small thing but it's actually  very important  Proud of you  3 The story of a lot of people here  I think  Most people don't really like to do that  but generally if you're just being used  you should filter those people out of your life its great to take small steps  keep up the good work  Live for nothing  or die for something   salutes  I didn't get one   I'm about at the cut off age for that kind of stuff though   Plus I didn't send any so there's that   I find sending them gets about 1 3 response rate in previous years  I have not had a Monster energy today   And I guess I'll go brush my teeth I have this sometimes         Today I think it was a mix of going to bed relaxed and having the deepest sleep I've had in years  Perhaps you stayed up for new years day with family or friends and was distracted from normal anxieties or sadnesses which helped you to get a more relaxed sleep       Alternatively sometimes I feel better when I haven't had enough sleep so it could be that It's a year until next new years eve  that's long enough for a positive change to happen  Talk to your family about their drinking and fighting and perhaps you can work together to make family occasions better in the future       If your brother is in the same situation I would suggest talking to him first  they're more likely to pay attention if it's coming from two people       Have a great 2017  That's a good use of water  too  I need to pick up on that as opposed to just dicking around while I am waiting   Fuck man  we gotta do something to get out of this shit   Try something and if you fail you'll back to square 1 but eventually you'll give zero fucks about failing   Trust me  I'm a complete fuckin' loser but I still feel like I can change my life   Good luck Please find some help  There's nothing wrong with asking for it or needing it  A therapist can be an incredible help no matter what your problem   If you have some family  friends  or even acquaintances  reach out to them  I know you feel like nobody cares  but that's virtually never true  Unfortunately people can't always tell when something is wrong  so you have to tell them  I know what it's like to sit there and wish someone would text or call you  or sit in the same room with someone and wish they'd ask how you're doing  You just have to say "I need to talk "  From your recent post history it looks like you've been doing well in terms of alcohol and self harm  Four years sober and three weeks without cutting is no small feat  That shows that you're a strong person  Stronger than you might think or feel right now  I know that relapsing can really bring you down  even severely  But you can't think of it as all or nothing  You can't think of it as complete success or complete failure  You've already chalked up that much time where you've abstained from these things  You know how to handle urges  You can always get right back to it    Don't let a temporary state of mind decide your life  I'm sure you've heard it  and probably don't want to  but it's a permanent solution to a temporary problem  And taking your life is like taking the pain you're feeling  amplifying it ten times  and inflicting it on everyone who cares about you   You have the ability to push through this  You have people who care  Find them  Don't assume that they don't care just because they're not asking you how you're doing  You said you spent time making other people happy  If that means just being kind to them or acting happy when you're not or cheering them up when they're down  I guarantee that they noticed    I have a friend who is one of the nicest  most upbeat guys I know  After I was dumped a few months ago he was kind enough to give me advice and help me through it  That's when he told me that he was fully ready to commit suicide within the past year  Rope tied up and everything  I never would have suspected that  If I did I would've talked to him  and if he asked to talk I would've met up with him in a heartbeat   Please stick around  Message me if and when you need to  Ask someone for help  Talk to someone  Life is worth it  and you're fucking worth it   I know I'm only a stranger on the internet  but I wish you a very happy New Year  You'll make a lot of mistakes in life  because we all do    The most important thing is that you think honestly about what went wrong and what you can do better in the future    It can be discouraging to fail  absolutely  But you should feel those feelings instead of ignore them  and then try and do better next time    If you'd ever like to talk  I am a teacher and a I have a psychology degree  Feel free to message me if you feel down or need help    I've worked with a lot of students who felt the same way  What do you think is the problem  Why aren't you passing  That's awesome    Keep it up     You're not alone  the exact same thing happened to my friend  I can't imagine how it must feel but for him he was really upset  Hopefully it makes you feel better to know that the kind of person to do that isn't the kind of person that is good to date anyway dispite how nice they may have seemed before  People can be surprisingly different when they aren't able to sensor what they say and what you know through text       You'll find someone don't worry     Many people only know how to play vid games and watch you tube  It takes effort to get a new hobby passion  No passion is dull  I believe that i actually have the motivation to study  but my parents are constantly behind me nagging to study and I seriously cant focus on studying if they are nagging me 24 7  it puts me off     Nah  it's been 5 years and I'm only getting older   Thank you  And I agree  I'll try to get of shape  I also think that'd help loads  Thank you  Maybe it's certain people that triggers it   Me too  It's the small victories  That's what kept me going  Please know that we are all here for you  Life is hard for everyone in their own way  believe me  Money doesn't solve problems  I am here to talk if you need or want to   Haven't had it myself but I'm really happy for you  it is a sign of things getting better  Thanks for sharing it's always nice to see that people's situations can improve Same  would have been absolute worse year had it not been the year I picked up the fiddle  Thank you so much love   I agree with you    I think my problem is more with the environment  maybe when I start college it'll be different  Hopefully it will   And I think I'll get better with time  Thank you so much for your kind words  I truly appreciate it  I can't study when I'm home I need to completely change environment  Why don't you do your study in a local library  That way you improve your focus and avoid your parents altogether   Are you still with us  Oh my god  edit  please be able to read this  edit  as in everything probably still sucks but hopefully you're alive and will read this  I get it too  I feel like I don't deserve the things and what little people that I do have in my life  Just don't give up   I had a rough couple of months a bit back  and I thought I wasn't going to 'make it'  and 'hanging in there' was horrible  with no interest in doing anything and it was so boring and I was paranoid and all kinds of stuff  but if you go through stuff just 'hang in there'  as they say   only thing else I can think to tell you is that you'll never be happy all of the time  I won't either  none of us will   it's just the name of the game I guess   Good job on saying it  I was bullied by two of my so called 'friends' and bringing it up on my own initiative was so difficult the first few times  But in the process I've learned slowly  bit by bit  whom to open up about it  and have talked to a lot of understanding people about it    I also have terrible coping mechanisms  I mostly play video games to pass the time  I am smart as my mother constantly reminds me  but all I see are my failures  I only find happiness from other people  I am always angry and sad  and this paragraph is a mess and now I'm crying   For nearly a decade I was similar  I simply refused to properly open up  And it took quite a bit to get better  Happiness feels like something alien you know  Not something you experience  it's something other people have  Just like connections   I've managed to do a bit better over the time  Hopefully you will do better as well  Even admitting that yes  you do have problems  can be a difficult thing  That takes a special kind of strength on it own  And I'm glad that you have it   I hope that the sun will rise for you  Happy 2017   hugs  My parents sadly dont let me go out to study as they believe that home is the best conducive environment   If your rationale is strong then I can be disproved  Maybe you just need a different environment  Have you thought about trying something new this year   Maybe for you  For me  95  of the times that I'm sad it's because everyone around me is in love  facebook is telling me how many people I know are getting married or engaged  and I can't even watch tv without every show and movie rubbing romance in my face    I live a decent life overall  but I've been single for a stupid amount of time for someone my age  I'm not saying I will never be sad in a relationship  but if someone loved me  most of my triggers wouldn't exist anymore  OkCupid  Tinder  Match  and every site in between for the past 6 years  Nothing works  I guess if your choice is Hospital or clozaril  you have to choose which one of those is more uncomfortable for you    Clozaril has a list of somewhat unfortunate potential side effects  but they are potential ones  Meaning  not everyone gets them and it's highly dependent on the individual who takes it  Seven people could come on here and tell you their experience and all seven of those could be wildly different    Many people decide that the side effects  if any  are worth having their minds back once they experience that  It is a very effective medication  It is honestly known to be one of  if not  the most effective medications for the symptoms you are describing  The only reason it is not prescribed more often is an extremely rare blood disorder than can develop  It's almost unheard of it is so rare  It requires that  especially at the beginning  you go in for a weekly lab draw  The pharmacy will not be able to fill your prescription unless they have the results of that lab work  It's a highly regulated special registration system for that med that pharmacies have to go through  If you miss your lab work  you don't get your prescription  They cannot give it to you  There may be a one day exception or something but in general  that is regulated by the FDA  so I don't think they have much leeway  I have two pharmacists in my family who practiced for over 25 years and neither one of them ever saw anyone have signs of the blood issue ever  They don't know any pharmacists who have either  It's a very rare issue    The other thing to keep in mind  is like any med  if you take it and it becomes unbearable in terms of side effects  where they outweigh the benefit of the drug  you can talk to your doctor about changing  If the side effects cause you so much distress that your quality of life is crap  then clearly the drug isn't worth it  Your doctor should be able to see that and work with you  A prescription is not a marriage  It's just a "try it and see " Oh I think I found your problem  For me home is the worst place to study by far  unless you have a study room with no bed or distractions  you will definitely get distracted because that's the place you use for fun and rest  You have to separate where you work and where you rest or your mind just won't allow you to get a good rest or focus when you have work to do   Since the beginning of 2016 my life has been a downward spiral  I see no end to this in 2017 also So you've been single for a whopping 9 months after 4 years of relationship  Sounds like you're doing quite well in comparison to me  I've spent the last  oh lets see  my entire life  alone minus the few relationships that lasted a few months at best  Oh and I'm not waiting til 90  I almost put a bullet through my head 2 days before Christmas  90 is simply impossible  Update  Got plastered for NYE  Managed to keep myself happy with close friends around and some other substance abuse  I lost all of mine basically  I've made a lot of friends in the past 3 years  I lost them mostly due to distance  sometimes because of conflicts or fights of sorts  frankly  trying to change yourself is obsolete  sometimes it isn't your fault  it's just the natural human selfishness  it's not because people despise you  it's simply because we the people  are cold fucks most of the times  people get new opportunities  and people move on  people like to experience new things  we have this grudge with the past  and most of the time  we tend to value more past relationships  frankly relationships are seasonal  every friendship  every romance  everything has a due date  either by human conflict or things beyond our control  nobody ever cares to say goodbye  they just move on  adapt  I feel stuck on the same place  ever and ever again  I can't move on  the way I can move on  is I just destroy myself mentally  and wind up somewhere  but  changing yourself is prone to only benefit you short term  I've tried it a lot  but you can't hide your true self  I accepted myself  but doesn't mean I am comfortable being myself  it's complicated     Anyway  sorry if my rambling might have seemed a bit out of place  frankly  people will invest in you if you invest in yourself  I know what you mean  by being a downer  when we spread our bad energy towards others  it's turn off  but  try to find other ways to discharge that negative energy  it's hard  but it's the only way  Don't be sorry it's not a waste of time if it helps you vent  Why do you think you're boarding   If only we hadn't been born without the natural gift of charisma they take for granted so easily    That makes sense     for now i do everything in 1 room  ill try what you say  thanks for your concerns   That means so much my whole life no one has said nicer things I'm going to hold off on suicide for now and just try and focus on work thanks a lot for the kind message   I do agree that it's like nothing matters at all and connecting with people for real seems impossible  I don't know if the expectation is unrealistic or I'm impatient or what  I wish I could let someone in and have them see but it's like nobody even wants to go that deep  And if I did let them in they'd just be freaked by what they see  I don't know  I wanna tell you one day you'll find something real  That's what I bank on  But I can't promise you I Play league of Legends but i am new  D Or you'll give zero fucks about repeating something you know the outcome to  Glad to hear it   Again  don't hesitate to message me if you need to   I know how you feel man  it's terrible  A girl came into my life and changed everything  made me love life again  but she left and became a completely different person and now i'm sill in love with the idea of her  not her anymore because she doesn't exist  she changed    but the idea of her  Coping with heartbreak is much harder when it's mixed with depression and social anxiety  And i know i didn't offer any advice or help  i just hope you feel better knowing someone is going through something exactly like you  you ain't alone   Same  I often feel like I'm not 'in the world'  because a person doesn't seem to exist without connections and I've spent most of my life cutting ties or hiding away  in expectation of rejection  But then I read posts on reddit and I know that other people are feeling the same or suffering worse  And that they exist  and they are brave enough to post how they're feeling     I do  I just posted about it last night similarly to you  I don't know what to do  I feel like a doormat because I just keep caring and continue to let it happen  People say to find better but I try and can't either cause nobody else wants me around or because everyone behaves the same way  I try to ignore it or act like it doesn't matter  that I'll somehow hit the jackpot and find the best boyfriend or best couple of friends who'll actually care but to be honest with you  I don't think it's gonna happen  So I essentially lie to myself and just pray naively I'm right   Congratulations guys  If you're reading this  it means you survived 2016  Let's try surviving 2017  Even if 2016 sucked and 2017 will suck harder for sure    2016 was one hell of a downward spiral and I don't know where I'm supposed to find the motivation to keep going  It's not like I see anything getting better    my car's fucked  I'm too injured to walk to a job  I can't make rent  I'm unattractive  I'm too quiet  or too awkward  or too slow for anyone else    Why am I still on this planet  I know this feeling all to well and it's terrible  If you ever need someone to talk to just message me   I know the feeling well  Especially with getting older its doesn't make "feeling connected" any easier  You're taking a huge step just by talking about it you really can't keep that bottled up it will just eat your insides  I try to focus on the things that really matter in my life  So no I might not have a ton of people that I could text to just randomly but my family is my rock and they would do anything for me  It does  It's bleak during the day  at night it's full on anguish    I don't remember the last time I had a good night of sleep   Night time is the worse  But weirdly enough  I like the night better  It's quieter  Fewer reminders that I should be out there  functioning so    there's that    Feel like shit  get angry and fall asleep  then regret all of it when I wake up I mean I feel like it's not worth getting mad at her for jt since she's not your girlfriend  Who knows why she didn't feel comfortable telling you but she didn't  I'd rather just keep an arms length distance and understand she's not always truthful and maybe one day you'll realize why she did that  And maybe you can protect yourself  But I don't feel like it's worth anything to try and find out why actively  Yes  an exhaustive search has only turned up more proof   If you say "I hate dogshit  because it disgusts me" this cannot be disproved  and no antidepressant will make it appealing to you  Extrapolate this to every aspect of life  You're not "hoping to like dogshit in the future"  Each time someone attempts to convince you "but dogshit is GOOOD"  just reinforces the idea that seeking advice from them is futile  Ah yes  being the observer  I see people having opportunities ill never have  They get to build relationships and have children  They get to have jobs and live life with the money they make  Even if they are not good people and hurt others with their behavior they still get to live more life  And then they take all that they have for granted  So it is    Sometimes  I wonder if I'm a list cause  My life is great or whatever  I just don't like myself  Maybe I won't be able to exercise or successfully complete NoFap or even get into a college I want to  Maybe I won't like myself  I guess I have up accept this   You're definitely not alone there  It's been a minute since I've been in your shoes  but I totally relate  Growing up my dad would get pissed at me because I felt I always made it worse  Not sure why  but it's what I've done as well  It's tough to go through  but it's possible  Feel free to message me if you wanna talk through it need any extra support  The journey is so much easier when we all help each other out  Same  not a single text  I thought I'd get one because I was texting a friend a lot close to midnight  but mid conversation she dropped me  No clue why   I feel like it gives me an excuse to be okay with being alone so I like it more  but during the day I get more distracted from the thoughts that make the night so terrible  If I could distract myself at night like I do during the day maybe it would be better  I'm a straight white male and I still want to kill myself  I'm also lonely as fuck    The grass isn't much greener on the other side I'm always sorry for talking about this   I'm sorry about the fact that people have to deal with me   Because there is nothing interesting about me   This is really crappy that all the replies were deleted  I came back to reply to OP who took the time to write back  and I see this happened  Some of us just wanted to reach out to others who were alone last night  to feel less alone ourselves  If we broke some rules here  I'd like to know what we did  Classy move  r depression  Are you transgendered  If so  I'm sorry for what you're going through  It's tough about there  especially for trans women   If you're depressed  it can be really hard to do any work  I went from being a 4 0 student to failing my finals over the course of a couple months due to depression  Please try not to blame yourself  It's not a lack of motivation thing  or focus thing  maybe it is  but it's being caused by something out of your control  It's not a personality character flaw  If it were   you wouldn't be on here posting about it   black out  lol  nah but seriously man  sex isn't everything  but as a fellow lonely person i feel your pain  if you wanna talk i'm here Thanks for replying   But I'm not going for the job  My father don't allowed me to go  I guess I just have to keep going the rough path       Happy new year to you   I'm sorry  That's hard to deal with  Just to clarify  you're not hearing actual voices  are you  If you are that doesn't make you crazy  just that you should probably seek treatment ASAP    I hope you feel better  If you ever want to talk to a stranger  I'm here  It just sucks  I have no idea if I've done anything wrong and everyone just kinda left me in the dust  I really cannot wait to graduate cause I'm trying to look forward and hoping college is much better thanks man Hm  I only really get that way if I do have a mood swing  I have bipolar   Do your ups last for more than one day or is it just the one night  Or has this never happened  If it's a temporary thing  I have no idea  I'm sorry   The closest I've come to that was when I was denying there was  a problem and sort of "overcompensated" sometimes so I could manage to do things like socialize  Happens to me all the time  Almost makes me think I'm just making the whole thing up or something  I just think hey I'm depressed  so I think I'll just lay in bed here all day because that's what depression is right  Even though in reality I think I have he abiliy to at least get some things done  Best method I've tried is to just sort of move on through it  Like if I'm actually too depressed to do anything of course I'm going to just lie around  but if I have at least some energy I might as well try to do  something  with it  Not anything in particular  just anything to keep my mind off the awful sinking feeling and the endless dread  Again  it all depends on how bad the depression is   Well it's been 9 days since this  and I'm more depressed than ever  I've considered trying to talk to her again  god knows why  and all this situation has brought me is pain  I'm not suicidal  don't have the motivation to be quite yet  but I just want the suffering that is my life to end  I have underlying depression that I'm currently not treating because I'm 37 weeks pregnant  Add to that the fact that my boyfriend  the love of my life and the father of said baby  was hit by a car and killed 2 months ago  I'm pretty much at the end of my rope   I hope 2017 is better to you all  Unfortunately  I know that if anything this year will be even worse for me  First year without him  Trying to raise a baby alone  Crushing depression  Yay  I've noticed that I've been "looking" for depression in other people  If I weren't depressed I probably wouldn't be  but aside from that depression has become a meme lately and it desensitizes the issue I think  I'm not "great" at it by any means but I think you should keep working on it and give it another shot  The feeling of not deserving it is a good example of another negative thought rushing to your mind and I think if you can slowly work on meditating and focusing on your breathing you can better control those things  You won't be perfect at it  the general process for me is "dammit there's a thought" over and over  but doing it imperfectly is still a great relief  This sounds odd but i've found it helps when I have a negative thought  imagine it as a leaf flowing down a river  think to yourself "this is just a thought " and watch it go away   What is your next goal  Don't do it  honestly if you're rock bottom it can only get better  There is help for you to get  Wow man  that's some difficult shit  I have a cousin going through exactly the same situation  Think about it do you want your child to not know who you  better your life for the sake of her  She can't not let you see your child  If you want to talk message me  I'm here dude  I understand how you feel and well 3 weeks ago I tried to kill myself  Life is hard and difficult  you know you can be happy as you said in your post  Message me if you need someone think of your child  I feel completely disconnected as well  Personally  I think the reason is that "simple things" are for "simple minds" and are tremendously unfulfilling to the point of disgust  I never feel a single moment of envy  just disgust    If you actually long for the simplicity of bubble baths  there is probably real hope for you  eg  pharmaceuticals  Im sorry for your lose if you ever need to talk im here  Thank you for sharing  what about the personal essay was really hard to do  I hate to be a Debby Downer but that's a lie dude   Some of us wont get better  some of us will just be stuck in the shit for our entire lives   Together we can try to make it just that much better  but some of us will never be truely happy for any substantial length of time again  How did you manage to do it  Were there any tricks that you used  I have a hard time brushing my teeth every day    honestly sometimes  its like 3 or 4 weeks between times    I am trying  I think I have brushed them 3 times in the last week and a half    that is good for me  my friend growing up went through the same thing with being branded an offender minus having the child  and near the very end after a mountain of pills and alcohol  he was filled with regret   he called up his first girlfriend and begged her to help him  but there was no time  he wound up in the hospital with liver failure  he was near death and tried to get help  but no one could help him reverse his decision  it took all of his power over himself away  they had to drop life support  his mother had to choose   and the thing is   2 months before  i had met him for the first time in years  and he seemed right as rain   as another said here  you're at the lowest you can possibly be  if you allow time for things to go on and suffer through every day  in time the only way things can change is for the better  don't do it  get more selfish  so hard to talk to parents when I feel like shit i read the fish oil book by dr  stoll re omega 3's  and the rhodiola book by dr  gerbarg and brown   changed everything  Like InanisV said  if you think you're at your lowest how could it get any worse  You can only improve   I lost the love of my life as well  I know things will get better even if it doesn't feel like it now    Your daughter will want her dad growing up  I promise you that  Things may be bad now but give it some time   Time heals and fixes things    You can get through this and your internet stranger friend believes in you    Good luck   i'm going through the same thing  but i'm 9 years older than you and the relationship was 9 years itself  she was a ball of anxiety  depression  and medical issues that were crippling for her  and incredibly taxing on me when i would try to take care of her  it turned me into a very negative  angry person  i drank a lot  i wound up in the hospital twice for it  i drank with pills and passed out  i smoked so much weed i developed pain in my lungs  it was very unhealthy  we moved across the country for work because i lost my job and she immediately left me for a guy on the other side of the country  she wanted to get fucked by a stallion and by god she got what she was looking for  now i'm fat  older  wasted a shit ton of money on this chick  indebted for it  and i don't know how to date  i can't get anything casual to get it out of my system  either  i think about suicide a lot and everyone that cares about me should be thankful i'm getting through my shit because i'm so very disinterested in living my life anymore  yet i go through the motions and continue to wait for something to happen  at the end of the day  the sun's coming up tomorrow  so i should  too  It takes a very long time to learn about ourselves  what you're feeling is normal  Yes  in time    good luck I don't know what I am  I just know that even surgery wouldn't give me what I want  But thanks for your words  Aha good  Well if in doubt I'm on Reddit    Everyday I feel this way  I'm so tired of it  I should be celebrating the start of a new year  but its only a new wave of crap coming my way  All I've done so far was shut down all social media and write letters to people I thought were friends telling them that this has nothing to do with them  I feel like they're all fake liars and then basically moved on while I've been stagnant believing in dreams that have a snowball chance in hell of ever being anything   The worst part is that I'm so much of a coward that I can't even kill my self  I've set out clothes and clippers to shave my head so that I look more like a black man and have decided to go to a police officer with a gun or knife  haven't decided which yet  maybe both so the cop feels better for their actions  and have them take care of the killing part    Even admitting this I feel like a piece of shit  the absolute proof that I'm incapable of accomplishing any task i put my mind to  But if I don't do it  I'm like a shell watching the world at a distance never belonging wishing that I could be even if its for a few minutes  It sometimes feels that I'm already dead and my shade is watching the world and interacting on my behalf   I don't know why I put all that in when all I wanted to do was say  " OMG  I feel like this everyday " Then again  I've given you proof about how stupid and selfish I am   Your family and friends support you  try to ask them for help  and show them you're depressed if they don't know you are  Not the only one that's fur sure  that's the reason why I came on here babe  there's a lot of people that feel the same  just remember to keep going  a friend of my once said "if something leaves you you don't need it anymore  " I start to believe that more and more  it just gets lonely and hard to believe there's anyone out there  so beg here I am searching  pcc    Life sucks  dude   I'm sorry about her  Hopefully one day we'll find someone to fill this huge never ending void they left in our hearts Exactly my thoughts   I'm dreading it so much I've come up with a plan to avoid it and the years to come  Writing has always made me anxious tbh  I don't know why it's so hard for me to get started  Also because I'm not sure why I picked that program or major and how to get it into words  Well that's something   cats are nice  Although I usually hear dogs are better at improving moods haha   Depression I sorta understand where you are coming from  i sometimes do that from time to time  but never really truly follow through  i would sometimes show interest but it will just dwindle away  I guess in a sense  i still don't really know how to make friends  Its weird how it is  if the person i talk to just click  it makes it a lot easier for me to become friends with them  But i know that the older i get the less these things will happen and i would have to work at it to make friends  which i feel its a pain in the ass to do haha  But i really do appreciate how you took your time to share your experiences and advice with me  it really means a lot to me  I would be  because blood levels can go up and down by quite a lot  and lithium can do a lot of damage to your body  But you need to make your own risk assessment   I don't think I really came out on top after all of this  that has yet to happen  I will continue to persevere after many failed attempts    I think that the people who are at the bottom will struggle a lot more to get to the middle or around there and struggle more to stay there  but will maybe have it easier to get to high levels  P S Now I am sure my parents aren't actually depressed because of me I have the same thing  if i brush my teeth that means I'm feeling at least slightly hopeful  But I have genetically awful teeth so most of the time I feel like there's no point because no matter how much I brush they are just gonna detiororate by the time I'm 50 I'll need dentures Changing is temporary    Your true self comes out and destroys everything eventually  I have no friends  not real ones  not anyone who would just sit here so I wouldn't be alone planning my suicide    No one ever stays  They always leave and and then belittle you for not realizing they're abandoning you  People who claim their friends are liars and cheats   they use you to make themselves feel better until someone else comes along to replace you   But if you're a good person and true friend  they would understand but they never do  Seasons change and so called friends change just as often   they start families and forget you were ever there  Fuck them  i am a straight white dude and i am lonely     i hope things get better for you OP   Thanks  I really appreciate the kind words   If I may ask  though  how long did it take for the world to become kinder   I'm in my second year of college and it's just as bad as high school  Did your family also get damaged by the communist system  Also is it south east Europe  My boyfriend knows everything about how I feel and am  and he chooses to be with me and love me regardless  I've also talked to therapist before  a couple different ones actually  but nothing ever came of it  It's more awkward than anything   Thanks I don't know you or your life situation  but I really hope you have someone you can talk to about this  and if not I would like to reach out and talk   Life is really hard sometimes  and I can't imagine what you're feeling  but please know there are people out there who want to help   So is it late too get into the school  I drink like a fish   I missed the application deadline  I'm planning to taking a gap year and reapply for 2018  Just not sure what to do for the next year  Absolutely  I do this as well  It's like I become a masochist when depressed  and I don't want to do anything because that's how it should be when I'm depressed  Void and vacant  Ah ok at least you have some time to think about it  Good luck dude  also try not ignoring your mum  it probably hurts her feelings    Yo dude PM'd you if you wanna talk I understand everything you're saying and experiencing  Keep it up and stay strong   I think it's an easy way for us to punish ourselves   neglecting ourselves physically    You're valuing yourself and that's amazing   Still  it is discouraging that 60  of my work will probably be towards hitting the level that some privileged people got a head start on top of Lmao this is actually the reason I'm so depressed this morning  All I want is someone to spend New Years with and kiss me at 12 but I guess that's just too much to ask for  Last New Years my girlfriend at the time refused to come and spend time with me  It actually pretty much foreshadowed how the rest of that fucking year would go  Good riddance  2016  I need help  Got so much problems going on  I know it will soon be ok  but i need help  thats why i made this account just now to share all this burdens  How can i survive  when even the person im looking up to is never with me  How can i do this on my own   I'm a bot   bleep    bloop   Someone has linked to

they don't really know how i'm feeling  I just want them to be there when i need it  I love them so much  the last thing i want to do is hurt them that's why i keep on going and try get better     don't neglect your teeth of all things  that shit wont heal    listen to this man  not just cause he's chuck norris  Last week I bit down on a fork too hard and chipped a tooth  It's a fairly small crack on my front tooth but it's noticeable close up and it is sharp enough to cause pain when my tongue runs over it  I had a "come to jeebus" moment when I remembered this is my only set of teeth  No more baby teeth to fall back on Getting on my bike before noon for the first time in a long time today  HNY EOODs  thanks i really appreciate You're not alone  We're right there with you  would have at least been an answer  It is entirely fucked up  I fully recognize that  Yeah I know  I'm an asshole for wishing that upon myself  as I stated in the OP   It is more so to have an answer to what the fuck is going on    If I could take your cancer from you  I would  You should stick around  Do you have any advice on how to deal with haters on youtube  My yotube career has been shut down 2 times because of hate from people who can't stand seeing someone else go from 0 to success and because of some of them even creating multiple accounts to dislike  Also  if being confident when depressed isn't realistic and I can't control genetics  do I just have to wait until my voice deepens so I can get back to youtube  Yay that's great  I really need to start brushing my hair every day  It's basically just a ball of knots on top of my head  Umm I wish I could say yes  but being social really just feels unnatural  Kinda like I'm pretending to be something I'm not  So I just accept that I'm a loner  I still have friends just not that many  The ol'  good shadowing     thanks man  Thanks for reading  always helps to be listened to  I like your username too btw  A better attitude is to be thankful to them instead of sorry for you  What do you do to entertain yourself   Wow I relate to this so much  This is exactly what I felt  in my post only yesterday   https   www reddit com r depression comments 5lb2hh have so much but dont want any of it    Yeah  some shitty stuff may have happened to us  but there are so many others who've had so much worse happen and they turn out fine  Then there's people like us who have so much to be thankful for but no enjoyment of any of it   All I can say to you  and i guess for myself as well  is that you are what you feel  There's no way of hiding you feelings to yourself  and those emotions are what will eventually find their way out to your being  If you feel like you're depressed  just admit to yourself that you are  Force yourself to go see a therapist  even if it's just once  Seeing one doesn't necessarily lead to anti depressants or other drugs  so you'll at least have the chance to say that your depression isn't as bad as some other people's   I don't wanna look like Agent 47    if you're gonna kill yourself which you shouldn't  at least do it the normal ways  Don't ruin some random guys day by making him shoot you  what the hell man    Often when I go out for a walk  I look at the people around me and feel completely isolated and alone  even more so than when I'm actually alone   Oh yes  that was me half a year ago  it was the most unbelievable  almost unreal feeling of isolation I've ever had    I was taking a walk  watching all these people having fun together  riding bikes  laughing  families together and all that stuff while I can't even fucking maintain a simple friendship because something is obviously wrong with me  somewhere deep inside    Like I shouldn't belong to human kind because I'm somehow unable to handle the most basic things that are normal and natural to every other human being   There are 2 levels of isolation   1st one where you just don't care and feel neutral about it  and the deeper  darker 2nd one  where you literally feel like a fucking alien sent on Earth    I'm sorry bud  Loneliness sucks no matter who you are  I really appreciate this comment  I'm basically in the same boat as you  It's nice to hear that I'm not alone in how I feel  Feel you buddy  only 20 hours in to 2017 and shit's already happening  even though i'd rank 2016 as the worst year of my life i've a feeling this is gonna be worse    that dogshit example was neat Why not try a different approach  well what is dogshit to begain with  it's got nutrients and vitamins and bacteria  It works with the digestive system of the dog  So a good piece means the dog is healthy    Now try to understand depression  It makes you wanna do nothing all day and things like that  But have you ever been depressed and someone  like your grandma or boss  calls and that forces you to be on your best behavior and for a minute you're not depressed anymore  Well that's means its a state of mind  Perhaps going outside and forcing yourself to deal with not people like that could provide you with a deterrence for the state of mind that is depression    There are different kinds of depressions so this example might not work for you but you get my point   Same I don't want school Even the most popular Youtubers have haters  The competition out there is fierce too  If that is something enjoy doing though  just do it  You won't get better without a ton of practice    I also post my artwork on Reddit and it's not always well received  But just remember  most people don't even contribute to the internet  they just lurk and comment behind anonymity  Keep at it Me too   About 22 and I'd I am just going to keep my head up and keep walking for now  Nice  what are you learning   Hugs to you OP  I see you  I would also tell you that you are not alone  Heck  99 of the people on the planet could disappear and no one would give a shit relatively speaking  It is a new year  This is not to say things will be awesome in an instant but it is a starting point  Take up a physical hobby  The endorphins you get from the exercise are very beneficial and help clear the mind  I'm pulling for you  Try 21 years for me   I'm 33   Totally don't care for the new year  I can't see much changing in my life and my current situation is unsustainable  I'm in the same boat  But it depends  how old are you  If you're in college or high school it's much easier than afterwards   Same here  It's almost as though you feel like you have to prove that you're depressed  That if you don't have the telltale signs then its not valid  so you try to maintain those symptoms in a way Seriously what the fuck  Theres a positive and negative side to everything  neither of them are more true than the other We want the positive things but when we have them we are not grateful  It's a circle  I'm not even sure to know what I want   I'm aware that the law in my state is  or used to be  a 72 hour buyer's remorse period  and most dealers don't want consumers to know about it   It's a massive hassle and the car can't be resold as new so the dealership takes a loss and I believe the buyer forfeits his deposit   I've genuinely thought about it   But ultimately it's not that bad a decision   I do need a car  and I'm not sure I would have found anything more suitable without spending a lot more  Downvote me if you want  but I went to  all and sorted by new and your post came directly after a post in r TenYearsAgoOnReddit and I thought "Ten years    I wonder what I'll be like when my reddit account is ten years old "  See you in ten years  OP  I love this post   Good attitude   I find it so interesting that you have a background in mental health but really didn't realize that you yourself had BP   Similar for us   All the signs were there that my wife had BP  but we didn't spot it till a professional told her she had it   Also  you are so right to say that it's not some sort of "bad" thing that you have BP   Us humans are flawed creatures   Many of have us have some form of chronic illness  yours just happens to be bipolar   it's no different than someone else that has diabetes  MS  Parkinson's or whatever  I want t sharpen a pencil and stab them in their eye sockets  my hands are shaking for no reason  I don't think anyone really cares about my problems  I lied about having a girlfriend and a first kiss to my parents so they don't think I'm weird  I don't know why everyone thinks getting a girlfriend is required  All the girls I have been around just do it for social reason or to get gifted some fucking shoes  I feel like like a burden and I'm sorry for whoever is using their time to read about my problems   I don't know what to do  I'm too lazy to revise which is my fault  I keep telling myself all these people who treat me like shit will get what's coming but do I really believe that  sometimes I want to just snap and stop taking their bullshit  But then I convince myself that getting punished and excluded for hurting them will mean they won  I'm such a loser lol  Why do I care if their parents can afford better trainers than mine     Not the worst but bad Lmao I got no idea either  I lost all my friends from high school too  I used to be social and happy but now i have basically no one and am just self absorbed and withdrawn most days  I hope you can stay positive  I want to think there is a brighter future out there  You're right   I can afford it     I am just mad at myself for lacking the discipline to stick with the original plan   The VA actually threw a monkey wrench into the works by increasing my disability rating  they gave me an extra  600 a month   I should be using that as a gift and an opportunity to invest in my business and accelerate my debt repayment   Instead I basically spent it all on a car  between the payment  around 450  and insurance  around 100      I'm actually still a LOT better off in my monthly budget than I was just a few months ago   Even if the VA change hadn't happened  this cumulative set of transactions shaved around  250 off my monthly bills which I will put toward straightening out other financial problems   But I could have had even more to work with if I'd had the patience and even courage to drive a beater car  or two  for a year or so  I feel like we are in the same boat  Im starting to notice that whenever im not stimulated these clouds of negative toughts starts to appear  And whenever i start to go into these clouds stories i make them escalate and i get depressed and the angst takes over  When i get this angst im a different person  My emotions is negative and my subconcious toughts  however i spell it  are negative  The only thing im working for in my life right now is to find some peace  Enough about me  What i want to say to you is continue to stay strong my friend  Life is weird and everyone has their own way  You are a fucking warrior that keeps going everyday even tho your body and head is not on your team  I love you and i feel for you  Seek some help if you get worse  you have nothing to lose  If it makes you feel better I didn't either  just watched movies and played video games til 11 59 then watched the ball dropped and then proceeded to continue my stuff Yeah thanks man  Been getting some help over the past few months and it's been meh    It isn't really psychopathic  I'm just constantly on edge   No pun intended  I'm sorry it was just a bad day and i wanted to share my thoughts  I don't really feel like i need any help  i'm just young and my head is unbalanced it'll go away   In college and on winter break currently  It's just that I've hung out with those people for a looonng time and haven't been meeting new people since and I feel like everyone already established their own circle of close friends so it would be weird difficult for me to include myself into their plans  Oh wow I didn't know that thank you for the heads up  Will be careful when recommending that in the future  Yeah often times bad things override the good things in my life and I'm not sure how to deal with it  Last year around this time I was in the greatest relationship I ever had  but things went south when she moved away and stopped being in touch with me  Made me want to KMS  Now all I remember and can feel is that pain I felt at the end  There are small glimpses I get of the good experiences I had with her  but I can only really remember the bad  It's like my default state is feeling bad and sometimes I feel good  I love the aggression man  You don't need a girl  you want a girl  You don't have to do anything Hooray  I am dark skinned asian  Basically among the most unsought after and undesired group for relationships regardless of anything like orientation  Anything else has a better chance than what I am    This is a problem for me across the board  feeling like my emotions aren't genuine unless I behave like the very picture of that emotion  When it comes to depression though  I try to remind myself that I'm getting up and doing "non depressed" things  despite  how real the depression is  because I have been here before and come out the other side before  because therapy and soul searching and trial and error through those experiences let me develop enough tools and strategies to let me keep tighter hold on the reins of my life when my brain spins everything out of control  Any degree to which I'm not completely powerless to my depression isn't evidence that it's not real  it's a sign of how far I've come  When I can overpower or outsmart this force that tries to keep me paralyzed  it means I'm winning  and that victory is hard fought and well earned   Lol  I didn't even watch the ball drop  I've lost interest in it  I used to watch it as a kid but it's the same every year and repetitive to me  nothing special  I just read my book and listened to music as I've been doing every night    no need to celebrate as it's a day like any other to me What's there to celebrate  same day as anything else Edit  If you want a fun read about threatened male sexuality you may look through  these comments   https   www reddit com r pics comments 5l9w24 not sure where to post my cousins job just asked dbu11b6   i know  I got some help aswell for a good time  Didnt help me that much  ive been isolated back and fourth for about 5 years now  2 suecide attempts  I had issues with myself since i was really young  Im 23 years old now  Still suffer from severe angst and depression  But im at this point where im really motivated to get trough this hell  And i know how you feel right now  ITS FUCKING TERRIBLE  D This is why i could never be a shrink because i really dont know what to say to people who suffer from depression and stuff  I just know for myself that it will get better with time and positive actions  Im here for you buddy  What i'm trying to say is style matters allot if you dress well it shouldn't be a issue  But if truly hate it there is an option get one of those proffesional wig's and people won't even know your bald  I knew a women who got bald and she had one and I never noticed it even after I heard it was a wig I still couldn't see it's fake  Find some friends One of the worst feelings I know is posting something and then getting no reaction  You make an effort  thinking you've contributed to the discourse  or whatever  and then nothing     So  I just wanted to take a moment and say that I agree with your sentiment  that feeling guilty over being depressed is weird feeling  happy new year  it's a brisk but sunny day here in New York City  and I'm actually about to go walk the 3 miles  roundtrip  to Target to return some workout gear I got for Christmas   running pants that are just a bit too long   best wishes to all on your progress  2016 was a ridiculous year for me   divorce  new job  finally sorting out all my shit with a therapist  getting my body in much healthier shape  dropped 15 pounds and improved muscle definition   and more   but I'm looking forward to 2017  Agreed 100   All it is is a change in numbers honestly  same OP  I just watch as everyone has fun socializing and having fun  enjoying each other's company   meanwhile I'm alone and bitter  I hate the pain and risk that comes with "putting yourself out there" but I hate the pain of isolation as well  No idea which one I prefer  I just finished reading Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari and it goes in to this a little bit "look at dogshit from a different angle"  is this correct  I got lucky  a few family members  grandmother and sisters texted me happy new year  I do that too  I like it because if I get toothpaste all over the place or all over  me  I can just wash it away   I don't know if this can work for you  but humor me   You say you feel like you "have" to do things that a depressed person would do during depression   Usually those seem to be "negative" things that reinforce or validate the depression   What if you convince yourself to do "positive" things a depressed person might do   For example  force yourself to do one good thing for yourself  Even if it's a tiny little thing like brushing your teeth or doing laundry   After you do it  give yourself a huge pat on the back   you deserve it   Another excellent one that I recommend is going out in the sunlight in the morning for 30 45 minutes  You don't have to leave home even  just go out on your porch  balcony or backyard  Don't give up just yet  Keep trying  there is a solution to your problems  thank Yessir break it apart find the biology and chemistry in it and understand it just like when the proctilogist does the colonoscopy without giggling  Same with depression learn some psychology and understand whats really going on   while I had a rather nice new year's eve  even made a friend  after a very insightful and "important" conversation while we were really drunk  today the bad thoughts start to come through again   I'm feeling so anxious inside  The girl I really like also hit on me  I think    but as always I was to shy to make any sort of move      BUT I got out of my bubble at that party more than usual  Meeting new people conversation with other's is usually something I really struggle with  which is at least something      But I still feel so shit right now  and it's not being hungover   this is why I smoke meth  Well kinda  My first suggestion would be to stop comparing yourself with others  We can only play the hand we're dealt  and many here have been dealt a raw deal  Don't make yourself feel even worse for your bad luck   start asking yourself how you can improve your situation and do it  Being alone is tough but there is still one person who cares and who can make your life better  you   first of all it sounds like you are fortunate that your bp isn't severely debilitating  if you can hold a job or go pass college classes youre doing a lot better than a lot of people on this forum   If you think you can't handle the upcoming semester  take a break   Also there are disability help centers on campus to help with deadlines and tests and getting you on a study schedule   2nd don't be afraid to ask for help  and communicate with your fiance   If he doesn't know whats going on  he'll just think you suck   Don't be afraid to take large amounts of time off to work on yourself   I two years of my life  my marriage  two jobs  and failed out of school due to avoiding my problems and my inability to ask for help   but other people have lost more and more time   If you have an understanding SO your already ahead of the game  and make sure to listen to him when he notices something "off" about you   I am awful at knowing how i feel and usually didnt notice that i was depressed  anxious  irritable  for long stretches of time until the mood passed  and since your SO is around the most hell be able to tell when your mood shifts   Most importantly imo BP does not allow you to prioritize anything before it   You have to come first  it sucks but you arent helping anyone if you cant manage your symptoms or if you are in the hospital   Good luck  this forum is awesome for finding other people with your same issues and can be very comforting  What do you aim to do to occupy your time  Thank you for sharing  soundslike a great routine   That's cool  I work image and video processing and optimization  what are the topics that you mostly handle  I've wanted to learn WebGL  but I was deep in the hole  whats the root of the problem  med compliance is only the symptom   do you not accept your diagnosis   do the drugs mess you up  or do you just forget   a pill box or setting a reminder on your phone might help but only if you want to be on the meds   also sometimes it takes the right cocktail   I got frustrated on my last round of meds and stopped taking them too  but eventually I went back to my p doc because i wasnt getting better  but i wanted to    It feels like you're just floating through life  It's a terrible feeling  They are equally killer   But you're right  Not having to pretend    I'll take that  I feel the same way   And it didn't help that everyone I know was able to tell me last night they were with family  And some even had a sec to wish me a happy new year   And here I sit  just as alone as I was then  But it has a 364 in 365 chance of not being worse   How hopeless that sounds  Dear F4ST M4ST3R  first of all  you are not your sister  As more pressure you put on yourself the harder it gets  What are things which distract you  For a lot of people it is electronics  if so but those away  For me it always helped a lot to write summaries on things I have to learn  Why don't  you set yourself miniature goals with your homework  Example  1 assignment and then 5 sit ups  Like this you get your mini breaks but are "happier" to do the homework because this gives you a break from working out  Just a thought    Fuck  I really wish I could help you     When the clock hits twelve  life's still shitty  Thanks     So by your logic bad things don't just happen we make them happen  I call B S  Gratz mate  Brushing your teeth is great  You feel so confident when you look into the mirror with those well kept teeth  You definitely exist without connections  Rejection is something we all experience  but for some the anxiety associated with the potential of being rejected is too much and we avoid social situations  People will tell you it's in your head and that if you just go out and try  things will be different  but they never are  The problem with social anxiety is that the expectations have been programmed in   the most rational thought cannot overcome the feelings of anxiety  The only way to deal with it is to gradually reprogram yourself out of the anxiety  There is a good approach for dealing with this sort of anxiety and it may be difficult  but it works    https   www verywell com how do i get over my fear of social situations 3024829  I also want to add that it is best to think of this as a disorder that can be fixed  not a fundamental part of who you are  Who you are at any given moment is the sum of your current thoughts and past experiences   if we change our daily experiences and our thoughts  we can gradually change who we are  It just takes time  My philosophy the thing is whenever I "put myself out there" it still doesn't change anything about the connection  Even If I had those hobbies that other people have which I'm envious of I think I still wouldn't feel more like I belong  I would just be the guy who's there and doing the same stuff  I literaly have never gotten to know a single person from going out or going to parties or to the movies  I guess people don't care about me much and don't want to know me What a shitty preachy post man  no offense   Glad to hear it  I hope your year is filled with lots more laughs  chuckles  tickles  and giggles     It's all good man  Sounds like you are still in high school  I am completely failing out of college  I have wasted thousands of dollars   So do I   I remember when I was 17 and had the feeling I was invisible  Today I am 30  and nothing has changed  I am the same  just way more worn out  In the trashcan    Jk   I mean no offense  I wanna reroll character  Like 10 points into charisma or something  Same with me buddy  I've knocked booze on the head  otherwise I'd have died through it  I take my meds  an on the whole  they work   Hope you're ok Start out by brushing before going to bed  Proud of ya m8ty  Take that momentum and go onto the next    To OP  if you're trying to help  go fuck yourself  If anyone here wanted this kind of "advice" they would go to church   I felt like this for a long time  but then I realised that I was happy where I am  For example  there were a number of times when I would think I was missing out by not socialising  but whenever I would bite the bullet and go out  I'd always be thinking about home and wanting to be in the comfort of my own home   Yeah  I echo the sentiment  Hugs to you all   Yes  unfortunately   There is no objective measure for depression   if you feel depressed  you are depressed  It doesn't matter how you get there  all that matters is what you're going to do about it  Go see a doctor or a therapist  read up on new strategies to deal with your problems  You can only play the hand you're dealt  and this is where you are now  Stop comparing yourself to others and start taking back control of your life  Sorry there buddy  Not really sure how I can help since I'm in a similar situation  All I can do is hope for the best for you and that friends will come your way soon  Thank you for caring man  it's nice knowing there are still people willing to support others through hard times     Hope everything works out for us in the end  Your bubbles of optimism are just too cute for me to pop Oh yeah I know how it feels  like    it comes and goes away  I hope you'll stay strong next time it happens  Yeah I'm not too worried about my post being ignored  It would've been nice to get some conversation going  of course  but I realize yesterday was a pretty busy day in terms of new posts and these kinds of feelings   Thank you for the reply though  Yo dude  speak to people it can really help a lot  I tried to kill myself 3 weeks ago and failed  it was a girl that pushed me over the edge  If you want to speak PM me   You do it enough times you start to love how fresh your breath feels afterwards  And you begin to hate the feeling of morning breath  SO it's definitely worth keeping up  well done mate  I'm 17 and I'm kinda on the same boat like you are  except the suicide part and christianity  I have loving and caring parents  and I'm the only son  Maybe you miss your parents  Has it been a while since you've seen your parents in person  If I were in your boots  I'd pack my stuff and live with in parent's house  Maybe you should hang out with your parents more   All NMDA antagonists do  in low doses  They are simultaneously sedating and activating  Does the college have campuses  If yeah why not more there  If no  well      d you know We're all sad people now  Oh yeah  i feel you OP  Nothing can ever replace that kind of want for me  I want it so much  To feel loved and embraced   Keep trying to find new distractions  When you are so occupied that you don't run out of them anymore  maybe you'll feel better Same  I crave friendships and relationships where I can share and learn and grow with those people  I have had it before and I know how enriching it is  But now I'm alone again and it is so difficult   Remember 2 years ago   You commented on a guy's reddit post for pokemon x and y when he was finding friends  Im sure at the time you had made him really happy by adding him  Now i know this is the typical statement  but maybe you should get back into pokemon as a hobby  find friends on the subreddits I understand what you mean though  by every logic  it we should be living horrible lives  Indeed  enjoying meaningless hobbies   Having people that care for you   With the current life that i lead  it should be IMPOSSIBLE but even so  I believe that you and I can somehow make something good out of this shitty world and find meaning to our lives    I feel the same  very anxious and alone  But I do not feel that I have the whole year for make or break  I probably have only this month for things at last to improve  Need more info dude to find out the actual cause  I was on mirtazapine a few years back didn't help at all  then went on to sertraline and again nothing so I gave up the meds  After a suicide attempt 3 weeks ago I'm on venlafaxine now and still no different  but my problems are down to the way I think and meds aren't going to change that  you may just need someone to speak to dude  PM if you need to  Yeah  what do you like to do mate  I'd like to know as well   I also think that there's no reason to celebrate but since people do it anyway  it's good to try to participate  For me  it isn't about a different number on the calendar  it is about enjoying the  few  good people in my life  i learned python now i am trying to learn c    i really want to build a website   Time is an arbitrary concept  so are the numbers we attach to it  It's difficult to get around that  i am into web design but i really want to get into making video games  I couldn't either  last time I drank I went to a dark  dark place and hurt my hand     The next hour more like  Well probably my favorite thing to do is cooking   There is something amazing about creating something that makes people smile  I really enjoy cooking because it is so calming for me  you get in a flow of things and just have a good time   And in the end  sometimes at least    you will even have a nice meal   Other than that   I also enjoy gaming  I don't play a lot but I watch twitch streams whenever I get the chance  watching people play league is a massive part of my life by now   Me either  Usually on holidays I end up texting a few people I know and wishing them well and they will respond  But I didn't even bother last night  No messages when I woke up either    No dorms  I could rent an apartment or something nearby  but I don't really have money to spend right now  Okay  How are you coping  I know how it is  We should just take a day at a time  I know for aure I can't have a year like last year again   way too much  I guess it's my turn to pay it forward   I know the feeling and circumstance you are talking about  no action you take betters your situation all the while everything just keeps deteriorating  Career  Family  Health  and Life in general   You have to understand one thing  It's the perception of mind  the intent of actions  and performing the intended action that will slowly but steadily change your circumstance  Unless you understand this and apply it to every aspect of your life  nothing will change  Another thing I would add is that the change wont happen overnight  It will take months before you see the effects    What you need to do is install new habits  adapt new values  and ultimately change your mindset so that the actions that you take yield the desired results      Here's what helped me       Creating a routine ritual  This way you have something to look forward to through the day     Workout  Hit the gym  focus on form  repetition  and then the weights  Don't have money  look into calisthenics  All you will need is your body  ground  and a pull up bar   Elementary school playgrounds have them and are free to use after school hours   After a few weeks  you will notice that you're less aggressive  have a more defined self esteem  and will begin to value self discipline and persistence     Eat  Not eating doesn't do anyone any good  You will be bitchy through the day and people will reflect that bitchiness back at you  If you are working out  you will need your strength so eat a balanced diet     Breathing exercises  Not sure why  but they will make you more mindful  make your body more efficient  and increase concentration  I suggest the Wim Hoff method since it's free on youtube     Clean up  Shave  get a haircut  brush your teeth  take showers  wear clean clothes  etc  It's nice tell people to nor judge a book by it's cover  but let's face it  your presentation of yourself will dictate how many folks look at you  This will also help you get a job     Few other thoughts       Ask yourself what success means to you  And then make really small goals steps to accomplish it  If you just perform the above steps without a set goal  you will aimless proceed through life and you will not be in tune with the changes      Hug your dad  He is the only dad you will ever have in this world  Even if you hate him  after a few weeks  you both will realize the the need for each other  If you don't see any changes at least know that you tried to love      Plasma donation usually give  10 30 depending on your location  It isn't much but it will put food on the table for a day or two  Also  there are churches and soup kitchens that can help you out      Wake up every morning and look at yourself  Make eye contact with yourself  And then tell yourself that you will put all your effort in whatever you are doing regardless of the outcome  There is nothing more "manly"  your words not mine  than giving your best and accepting the win or fail outcome    Good Luck   D  I like your insight   I used to work with dual diagnosis kids and saw abilify change lives  I personally had an awful experience    I was sleeping 20 hrs a day no matter the dosage and wetting myself through out the day night when I first was put on it in high school    As the above person said  sounds like doctor is being careful which is good  Antipsychotics  especially with kids need to be monitored  But give it a chance    You're a rock star parent  Keep on keeping on  I dont mean to dismiss you  but I cant even get  one   assignment done  So should I make smaller goals  or take a different approach  If you're a guy stay away from prostitutes  Prostitutes and bipolar do not mix well   Masturbation is prob your best bet besides sex  and that's just temporary relief   But it's lasted months for me  so it can be exhausting to keep up   Def get to Dr  for some meds to help cool off if you don't have anything   Good luck  You should watch Chill with Bob Ross    that's what I'm doing right now  it's so calming  i am 27 living with my parents and I had sex for the first time 2 weeks ago and the first time wasnt that great either   Three days ago I desided to change my life  and made a linkedin account and there seem to be many opportunities there but you need to setup linkedin properly   I fucked up already  I hurt someone I care about and have no idea how to fix it  I'm jumping between feeling like a god wanting to step in the river and wanting to fuck anything that moves How was it     it really isn't meant to be if you've been trying for a year  If she doesn't want to talk to you then it would be best to honour that if you really did love her  It will  I promise it will  All one can do is be the nicest  kindest and friendly person that one can be  Fuck everything else   I live by one principle  if you don't like something being done to you  don't do it to others  Or  treat others as you wish to be treated   It's one common theme across all major religions   If we all lived by this principle  the world would be a better place  It's such a simple code to live by  This is awesome    Proud of you OP Things won't magically be better because yesterday was 2016 and today is 2017  That's not how things work   To get better  you have to actually  do  something constructive for yourself   I've spent the last ten years using bipolar as a sort of victim card because it was easier for me to use it than to address it  I know that probably makes me sound like an awful person  but whatever    Diagnosis or not get the help you think you need and don't be afraid to be your own advocate  The med trial and error game suckkkks  And antipsychotics in general are no walk in the park  but just wait it out    I was originally diagnosed depressed than had a HUGE antidepressant induced sleeping 2 hours a night  solving the worlds problems  as hyper sexual as a hardly pubescent 14 year old girl manic episode that took about a month and a shit ton of abilify to bring down  And after times trial and errors  unintentionally going off my meds  getting hospitalized  going on and off meds for years  experimenting with adderall only to find it changed me life  un medicated stabilizing through out pregnancy and breast feeding  and my most recent depressive crash I'm full of diagnosises and found a med combo that is promising   It's not an easy road  but dude  you've made it this far with out the diagnosis  you can keep on  Just advocate for yourself  Be as strong as you can  find support for when you need help being strong and keep your head held high      Also haven't slept this year cause I suck at meds sometimes so this is me trying to type out my thoughts before they go away      thanks bud you too sex was very awkward in the car  Obviously I dont have my own apartment  that is why she broke up with me  At least one of the reasons  However  it wasnt as I thought it would be  The next time that followed was better but still  awkward   My change in life  Linkedin seems a great tool  I applied for 10 interhsips already  I was a bit late to apply for the google intern  but I will try another year  maybe I will have more experience and I will be a better candidate   I'm feeling down today as well  I'm one to listen to depressing music when I feel down tho  Maybe you're looking for happy chill music      I really like Anderson Paak's Malibu album  It's got a relaxing hip hop feel to it   If you want a sad song  Stop the world by krizz kaliko is definitely it   Oh boy sounds bad    And of course on a holiday weekend   Get in to your Psych or the ER ASAP if you're thinking of suicide   I don't know about the details  but often we can be forgiven for some of our transgressions   Usually our loved ones know it's not us but an illness  I feel exactly this  this exact feeling is why I'm on this subreddit right now   Yeah I remember that feeling  But you should just throw yourself into a club or something and see if you can integrate yourself  People switch groups all the time  It's way easier honestly in college when there are so many likeminded and aged people around you   I was 25 when I applied for my first internship  I had no degree  it was a design agency   so I contacted the CEO directly  She knew I had no credentials  but she saw I was eager to bust my ass  One month in and they offered me a position   It's possible  you just really need to want it  Any advise for someone who just graduated  I don't have clubs to join The bad thing of LinkedIn is that if you use it to message people  your account would be banned  I send a few messages already and now I have to insert a code to send a message  Big firms also are impossible to call unless for product service   But yea  I plan on calling them  at least the ones that are possible   edit  I also think it is not possible if you just really want it   I have been wanting it for a very long time  but depression was holding me back  You need action and that is what I am trying to do  I'm not feeling that great myself at the moment but in the past when I've been not enjoying my life from day to day I imagine a happier future self that I almost see as a seperate person and imagine that they are really grateful that present me took the time to do things like get an education that make their life a little easier and safer  Sorry if that doesn't help  sometimes you just have to find any way you can to get through it   Have you used any of the APIs  Direct3D  OpenGL  Vulkan  etc  Or any game engine  like that one that's open source  forget the name   I've used OpenGL 3 in C   for a few things  it's easy  I have no idea how to use java My ex boyfriend has said this exact thing to me more than once and it really does terrify me that he thinks like this   Stay strong  buddy  Honestly  There's so much yet to be done in your life  you don't want to miss it  Depends  In most multiplayer games it  competitive especially  leads to frustration and annoyance  But some of my fondest gaming memories come from communicating as well  When Firefall had thumping at high levels  with everyone working together and communicating  it was fantastic   Agreed  It's a really weird thing to experience when you're in a public space  The exchanges interactions that others have  you just sit there and wonder 'why not me'  What sucks most is when you're a seemingly normal person that's put together and coherent  but inside everything is unbearably uncomfortable and hopeless  Yeah  I started off taking 500 mg per day and saw some temporary benefit  Then I read a study that demonstrated how three depressed patients went in full remission after taking 2 3 grams per day  I have been taking two grams per day for about a month now  I am currently experimenting with dividing the two grams into two seperate doses and taking both grams at once  I have read some anecdotes that taking two grams at once works better  In any case  it will likely take a couple of weeks before you see any benefit   I have also been taking 4 5 mg of low dose Naltrexone per day  which I suspect is helping as well  Interestingly  both Naltrexone and Agmatine have tolerance reducing properties  I have no idea if these mechanisms directly play a role in their antidepressant effects or if other effects are at play  However  both substances seem to be sustainable treatments  as opposed to treatments that need to be cycled   which is probably the best characteristic for a compound intended to treat anhedonia   At times life is good  at times it feels like worth of giving up  Fixing those issues is like moving a mountain just to get to the starting point where other people start their journey  Hey   U ok   I wrote about it  here  https   www reddit com r SuicideWatch comments 5i99lj 31 december 2016 ship canal bridge figured most db7k7yk  context 3   Same  it doesn't help that someone I literally just made friends with not too long ago cut ties with me without warning or telling me why  I feel so alone  Okay  I understand  Do you have a support system for when times get tough  i didn't get into APIs that's a bit of an advanced topic for an armature   like me      if you've been able to learn c   then java won't be any problem    awesome  I always wanted to learn to code but I think it would be too much for my brain haha  Dont have the time either Thanks man  Yea  saw some fireworks walked home and cried three hours straight without being able to stop  For the last three and a half years that has been my holiday routine  I hate my life  Thanks man  likewise   it will b difficult for me yes    worse i dont know   i m going to take steps to get myself out of this mess  Fuck the world  Yesterday I saw some fireworks walked home and cried three hours straight without being able to stop and for the last three and a half years that has been my routine for new years  It is really starting to be unbearable  That's what i've been telling everyone how i feel  I say I'm just an observer my whole entire life  Trying to fit in a world that i'm not compatible with   I have a long drive ahead with my wife and kids   Then she has to talk to me and I'm pretty sure she wants a divorce   I don't want to lose my kids  I've been sick to my stomach and wanted to cry all day   I have no one to turn to    And my kids don't even know yet   I just give up  Saffron 30 mg daily That's what I've been so paranoid about lately  Everyone who I considered to be close friends suddenly wants nothing to do with me  They've cut ties with me without telling me why    I feel like one of them is talking shit behind my back   I just don't understand  I've been crying to myself for at least 2 hours  i just feel like shit   Somehow I kinda felt the same during mid college years  Since you say you had a rough 2016   its the past there is no need to think of it even if you feel like it  you can only go forward and if you decide to think ahead  it will make you feel way better even if things didn't workout the way you like to  I know life isn't easy if we overthink every stuff that happens  why do you feel that you don't have friends that care   have they done something or ignored you when you needed them the most  you know   you can make them care by caring  I mean   maybe make some new friends or show them that you care by asking them some questions that would get their attention  and remember you don't need others to make you feel better   feeling good comes from within yet friends are important  its going to be alright   don't overthink stuff and have a purpose  maybe make a small change in your life and the way you think   life without a purpose or something to hope for and look forward to can be depressing jesus christ literally me this morning  Try different ways and find the right path for you  The most important of all things is that you don't give up  Everyone is able to study just in different ways  Let us know how it's going   Another thought  Why don't you ask your parents or even your sister to help you and honestly try  So I guess the stories of being a wizard when you hit 30 as a virgin weren't real        u crowbird  it's not that hard you gotta start small   start with a simple to use and easy to learn programming language like python or visual basic hope this helped      I feel the same way  2017 will be the year i do something  Either die or live  not more of this living hell    Perhaps you could treat it as an escape button in case things go bad  Do something crazy like go swimming in a public pool  I don't have anyone to celebrate with At least you have that option there  I live in NYC and getting a gun is near impossible  especially for me because i have medical record of suicide attempt  I wish i have a loaded gun in my closet  that would bring me so much comfort knowing i can always have that option  I hope it brings you comfort too  knowing you have a easy and quick exit always available to you   The moment I tried to be more outgoing and try to make new friends is the moment my college career was taken away from me  I'm tired of trying   have you seen "Search Party"   Pretty funny but also tense series  Has one season so far  I'm so sorry  Like you said  people are cunts    I'll never understand them  Every last single one of us do it  The most depresding thing about depression is how yours is no different than mine or anyone else's here  So the next time think "  does anyone else  " the answer is yes  where can I find it  4 years for me  yay  T T Thanks both of you  I'll give my fitness pal a try  Sorry man idk how I would deal with that type of stuff  Would surely ruminate about it for awhile  It sucks   Feeling like this is incredibly common among people who are depressed  Depression sucks the energy and motivation out of you  you notice you're not doing much any more  you think you're lazy  depression deepens  slows you down more  It's a vicious cycle   I try to remind myself of this  and it is very easy to see in other people  but I also find I get disgusted and angry at myself for the same reasons you do  Hey  its a weird world we live right know  Im in a similar situation  and honestly spending time with other people works for me  Its comforting for me to listen about their everyday problems  or what they did  or what they are planning  Sadly not too many people want to spend their time with me  But even tho Im struggling with few other problems  also anger  cursing  bad thoughts   Im trying to learn from every action I took  and make myself better  Lately I started doing some exercises  It works for Your mind good too   Check out "Boyinaband" channel on Youtube  He did a challange connected with his mental health  that made me reconsider few things   So yeah  if You would like to talk  I can help  I think that this is probably a common concern for people with mental illnesses  OP  I worry about this  too   The fact that you are even concerned about this makes me think that it is not the case  Also  it's okay to just want reassurance  someone to talk to  or even just a hug sometimes    same here nothing ever changes Good luck  Programming is very rewarding and fun   Thank you so much I really needed that  Never change yourself for this  Never  False communion is a poison worse than loneliness  Hey I'm 19  and experiencing the same thing as you  Please please please PM me   It's good to know that i am not alone    Thanks for the advice  i really appreciate it    Same here  it sucks but me and some friends just jumped online and brought our New Year together playing some Gears 4   Nowhere near as good as kissing the guy or gal of ya dreams but I figured it was better to occupy my mind with laughter and fun than dread or brood the fact that I'm essentially alone    Pick your mental battles and try to win em this year  Happy New Year  friends   uh it was uploaded to tbs's site I think  Otherwise just google it  It's not on Netflix or something  i feel the same check out the rhodiola book by gerbarg and brown and fish oil book by andrew stoll md Ive thought about trying it  but it is so expensive haha  maybe I just need to find a good place to buy it  What does a non depressed lazy person look like  Thanks I'm currently in a situation that has some similarities to yours  33 year old guy  having just left my wife due to me realising I don't love her any more  I don't want to go back to her  but being single is making me incredibly lonely  I only have one close friend  who I can't see very often  I'm also in the UK   I'm also thinking I need to get out there and make more friends  but I don't really know where to start   I can't really offer advice  I guess I just wanted to say you're not alone  This   dude this is totally me  And my depression is also much much more severe than probably 99  of the people in this discord or sub  I don't give a shit about anime and I also find RPG's boring as fuck  It's your birth certificate I just got one Happy New Year text  My mom     Happy New Year OP   Ironically the people who put down using the computer are the ones who spend most of their time socializing on their smartphones which are basically small computers  Hey  thanks for your reply  Much appreciated  One followup question  any particularly noteworthy adverse effects when you started taking LDN   Low dose naltrexone is something I've learned about only recently   Thanks    there's hope for us afterall    I'm planning on not surviving  Cutting your arm is safest for me to avoid making a mistake How long has it been since you both broke up  Would you setback together with him  Someone whos not mortally bothered by their laziness  My PC kept me alive I don't know what to do with out it Idk I think Filipinos can be pretty cute  Personally I think dark skinned asians tend to be cuter than light skinned asians  It's an distraction  Might be beneficial  I can talk to others   May be harmful  because it only covers up and postpones my problems  Yes  It can  I've experienced it before  I literally went years without really touching someone   Dear  u rob cornelius  thank you so much for all your kind words to everyone and your support of this sub  You're a good friend to people here  they do stuff without me and i dont think they are my friends  i do have some friends who "care" but they dont try to talk or anything  I have moments like this but then feel like a hypocrite since I havent sent any either  I think about everyone but i doubt they want to get a message from me so i dont  Its fine though  End of January at the soonest  I get super vivid boring dreams    like I'll dream about getting ready and then my alarm wakes me up and I think well I can stay in longer cause I already got ready and then I'm late to work AND had to get ready twice  Or I'll dream about paying bills  Seriously I don't lead a dull life but in dream land I do and it screws me over    It's really just an annoyance and it's totally worth it because I now go days with out think death is a logical option   Thankyou  It will get better  If you truly believe and want to get out from this step by step  day by day  You will thank yourself in some years and look back at this period of your life like a chapter  The things you experience now will give you alot of qualities a person  You see the world in black right now  We all have our own way of getting out from a depression  You just gotta keep fighting   3 New year same shit to be honest  I have had a bad few days and it's most certainly not getting better  So just know you're not alone  I think we  this sub  still mostly thinks of suicide as something bad  We don't want each other to kill oneself    But we won't shame or guilt a person about it   About describing it as a battle or a fight  I understand very much where that comes from  And I can follow the thought  Yet on the other hand psychologists have learned that it's not helpful to use martial language when it's about describing cancer  There is so much military language in use  "Fought the battle enemy"  "lost the the brave fight"  "a survivor"  "beat it"  Again  I understand where it comes from  But often it's not helpful  If cancer comes back it's not the fault of an ill person who's not trying hard enough  There is no "losing the fight"    Some links    https   www theguardian com society 2014 apr 25

worsening of one of my IBS symptoms  but that has subsided  My doctor predicted that would happen  LDN is actually phenomenal for IBS       I am currently two months in and one side effect that has remained is vivid dreams  They're the type of dreams that you wake up and question whether or not the dream was real  My sleep has definitely improved though    Lastly  my appetite has been consistently reduced  almost to the same extent as Adderall  Managing that side effect takes planning   So the side effects are bearable  One thing to look out for is rashes  I've heard scattered anecdotes of facial rashes  but I haven't experienced it   The number is different but the shit is the same I don't want you to feel like you're not entitled to calling yourself depressed because you do in fact deserve to call your state of mind however you want  after all it's your mind  Depressed is just another label which I don't like   I can't comment on how my age has affecting anything  because I was just diagnosed   but I've had fairly a positive experience with Latuda  if that's what you're thinking of trying next   Doing okay  Christmas was a struggle   Ya  you become the witness of everything  Depressed people think a lot  it's one of the reasons why we suffer  Other people don't stop to analyze things  they are fine with whatever is in life for them and lucky for their happy genes  Can you get your doctor to write up a letter explaining your depression and that you are receiving treatment  That might help as it's coming from a medical professional   I have no advice on getting out of bed  sadly  Most of the reason I kept showing up for work the last few years was that calling off was harder for me than just picking my clothes off the floor and going in  I got so I could get ready half asleep and show up at work with no idea how I got there    But once I was there I worked hard to pass the time and take my mind off things  so I didn't seem lazy or depressed so much at work   My husband tried to help by making sure that I had food  tea  a lunch packed  etc  He did everything he could to make sure that I kept the job and I still barely made it  I still had  so many  lates last year that I almost got fired   I finally got sat down and asked directly about the lates and had to admit that I was depressed  That was about a month into a new medication  and since then I've done much better but I feel relieved that my manager knows if I call off it's because I really need a mental health day  and he understands   Edit  I work in retail  which is incredibly difficult at times but offers a lot of latitude for "good workers" to slip on attendance because it's so hard to find people who are willing to show up at all  let alone do their jobs well  And did it get better after you found someone   Had multiple breakdowns in December alone  and thought about taking all my pills and just being over it  Today I woke up  took some st John's wort for my mood and actually just forced myself to be positive and set some life goals  I'll probably crash  but I'm gonna use this holiday as an excuse to get better  We can do it people  I haven't had plans with people not in my family on new years in ages  It sucks and I understand why you hate it  I literally just laid in my bed and just scrolled through reddit  I usually talk about concepts  and I give a pretty long explanation for it to make sense  But sometimes people forget what my main concept is and start referring to things within my explanation  Anyways  Im trying to find a method to articulate better  Slower talking  faster talking  More enthusiasm or less  Lower or higher tone pitch  Specifically when I want to come off as serious   Yeah I'm on the same boat  I've had a really bad few weeks and 2017 won't change anything lol  I never have  There doesn't seem to be a point to it  just another shitty year   Yeah  it's part of why I quit doing the whole New Years celebration thing  Seemed pointless to celebrate getting the chance to live through a whole new year's worth of pain and suffering with even less chance of it getting better than I had last year  since 1  I'm another year older in a country that views getting old as basically a poor life choice that you should have planned to avoid  and 2  the incoming administration has  as its campaign platform  the stated goal of working directly over the next 4 8 years to make the lives of people in my demographic  poor  aging  but still impregnably female  among other things  ongoingly more miserable  scary and painful than it already is    Hah well so long as the cat helps it's good 3 what's up  Haven't had New Years plans in years  I understand your pain  It sucks and you're not alone  If you live in the UK depression is classified as a disability if you have it for over 9 months  Not sure about elsewhere Oh  I sure hope it gets better  Same here  It's harder for me since I'm a college dropout and my job doesn't have any good environment I feel the same way  I'm still struggling with feeling so tired all the time  I'm still practicing mindfulness  taking my new medication  not binge eating  I'm really working hard at getting "better" and forcing myself to do all the menial but necessary tasks I would rather not  I just  I dunno  I hope all of my efforts one day pay off because I want to experience what life has to offer  Happy New Year everyone    Its just that we dont know how to love  so it just ends up hurting us What are his symptoms  You have to define what depression is  you don't have to say that you are this or that  but you can admit that you're suffering   A lot of people I see on here are either had a traumatic experience that has affected them in one way or cannot help but suffer in life  even if nothing is wrong  just their chemistry is messed up  constant pain no matter what    Though  there are others that can't get their way  maybe a relationship problem or they aren't fulfilling their desires  of course  they get depressed  but in my opinion  I don't think they can truly relate to the above  It sucks  it really does  Not only have I not been delt a bad hand  but I've actually had so many opportunities to take advantage of that some people would only dream of  Yet I'm still stuck with the same state of mind  It's like I don't deserve to be happy  but I also don't deserve to be depressed  as weird or ironic as that may sound  Hapiness normally comes with small acts or activities that makes you feel alive inside  I'm glad you shared your experience and I hope 2017 will bring you more of these  D i honestly feel the same The ironic thing is  for the very same reasons  leaving the US is quickly becoming something many of us born here may have to do in order to survive  I know if they dismantle the ACA  I'm going to have to try and find way to emigrate to a place with socialized health care if I ever want a real chance at having access to health care outside of an ER ever again  I just looked at what the cost of my crappy " 3000 per person annual deductible  and then we only cover 70  of what comes after that" policy would cost without the subsidy  and it's like  1500 a month  And that's  with  the price break that comes from the mandate and includes all the preventive  no cost care the ACA requires  Might as well be a million bucks  since there's no way I could ever afford that  And come Jan 7  the new administration has promised to start gutting the program of the very things that make it affordable to anyone who isn't already in the upper income levels  And likely ripping out the required preventive no cost coverage  too  since that's a core ACA component  I'll take a look at that later   What do you think about a session of gaming with me  I'm depressed too and need a good match to relax     Actually it seems i may have been mistaken  it seems that 16 is the age of medical consent rather than confidentiality  and it's still possible to get treatment without parental consent in some cases  http   www fpa org uk factsheets under 16s consent confidentiality You may also want to contact childline if you're parents are abusing mistreating you or you feel that they will be incapable of adequately supporting your mental health I haven't got help been suffering for few years I want to get help too because I'm just getting worse and worse too it's not just going to go away Good for you So true  I get so much more work done when I'm at the library  I think knowing that I would have wasted time if I left without getting work done is what keeps me on track  I don't even have the first part anymore  Couldn't of said it better than that  Why the fuck is everyone on my instagram feed partying celebrating  I don't get it  Father was killed in November  mom has been spiraling out of control since  She confessed to me about her plans for suicide back from before my father was killed  She still doesn't know about the two times I tried to kill myself    The holidays were once again excruciatingly lonely and I still wear my happy family mask almost everyday through these months    New years was a fresh glimpse into my self loathing  I got a ride from a very important person in my life  This was nice  except that I was my usual self and feel like I pushed this person further away  I've spent every moment analyzing everything I said and did around this person last night  and all I can feel is shame and embarrassment  and sympathy for that person    Been laying in bed all day today  Haven't moved or had anything to eat or drink  January 1st 2017 would be a pretty good last day on Earth   if I could actually do it   I feel the same as you do mate  and it's a perpetuating cycle  You feel depressed  then guilty because you feel you shouldn't be depressed  then depressed about the fact that you fee guilty    As  u Hgf123 said  there is no objective measure  you feel what you feel  I'm going to expand on this a little because it's how I can articulate my own concerns   There are starving people all over the world  yet a lot of us can afford to eat lavishly  Should we feel guilt about that fact we've all probably said 'I'm starving' when there really are starving people in the world  No  because contextually we exist in totally different paradigms of hunger  You shouldn't be made to feel guilty because you live in an environment in which food is readily available  A moment can be spent thinking of those with issues  causes can be pursued  injustice felt  but guilt in this situation is baseless  I feel the same about depression  Someone may have lost limbs  parents  squirrel's  you never know  and that has driven them to deep depression  You just woke up and you're depressed  Again  contextually  what causes your depression is a totally seperate paradigm  Just because someone has been through 'real' trauma does not make them more entitled to being called depressed  Personally I know my depression started long before I had any real trauma in my life  and even after the many years of hell I put myself through I still don't feel like I'm worthy of being depressed  But I can't help the fact that I'm in pain all the time  I struggle with so very much  and I shouldn't need to feel guilty because I never lost an ear fighting the Spartans  I know I trivialise a little       Sorry  such a ramble  Basically  it's all about context  We feel things because of our context and we can't compare our feelings to someone that has lived in a totally different context to us   I hope this has made sense and helps a bit  Sorry if not  I've taken my sleeping pills which make me a bit funny  but I couldn't help but post because  like I said  I often feel the same  Better than Heroin i suppose  They're trying to distract themselves from the fact that they and everyone they know are completely insignificant  I feel the same bud  I just posted a reply on the other message you posted on  Have a read  maybe it will make a bit of sense to you   https   www reddit com r depression comments 5lfo84 i feel like im not even entitled to call myself  You're still a person  You're going through a hell of a tough time but you can get through it  You don't need to remember how to act as a human  as you get better you'll do it intrinsically  hey man  i hope you change your plans on that  im rooting for you Well said Good for you  You should definitely be proud of yourself  Doing my hair is hard for me  I get to the point of consistent tossing it in a bun and not giving too shits  Thanks for the encouragement to make a goal like that for myself  I remember that post  I didn't reply back then  but looking over your comment I wish I had looked further  This is going to be one very  very big bulk of text but please read from beginning to end   I'm 23 just like you  And 23 years ago  people found out from the get go that I was a bit    different  I didn't interact socially much  and kept to myself a lot  The diagnosis came pretty quickly  autism   Now  my family fortunately did a good job at handling it  So while my childhood wasn't perfect whose is   it was pretty damn nice  and slowly  bit by bit  I managed to get more social  So at the end of childhood I had a few friends  And a good piece of news came  for freshman middle school I would be put in the same class as two of my friends from elementary   And they started to bully me  Those two 'friends' of mine   So  this destroyed me mentally and emotionally  and since I was already disoriented all the time thanks to my autism  I closed myself up  I became frozen  And although I did get in another class the year after  I didn't dare opening up  In that same class I managed to do a bit better grade wise though  This made sure that I would be put in a higher level course next  The reason I was the most happy about this was because I could get into an environment without those bullies  So I tried opening up again   And I got bullied  Again   This made me 'reconfirm' the negative self image of myself  which was initially taught by two of my 'friends'  So all of my years of middle high school one thing in the Netherlands  were complete hell   To top that all of  I also got kicked out of college once  This happened because I had to do an internship  but the company I did my internship at wasn't suited for someone like me  who has a form of autism  Internship got terminated  I got a lesser quality  degree  and with no experience and it being the middle of the recession no one wanted to hire me  No one   Now  a few years later I'm studying physics  And I've finished an internship overseas  in the US  And I worked alongside an internationally  well known project within particle physics  I've also made a lot of good friends through the years  So all is going well    And I STILL wish that it was better    But you know what  That's natural  To want things to be better is only natural  Like you  I'm 23  and still don't have a relationship for example  That sucks  You see everyone already  having or having multiple relationships and you still don't  In my circle of friends there are only a few left with no relationship experience  Even though I'm one of the older ones     Still  in my opnion it's important to accept where you are  and not where you should be  It's all right if you're not all right  Do you get some dots in your mouth that hurt like hell after a few days of brushing  Sounds nice  What are you playing  Of course  that's the best way to keep forward    I really like that classic image with the dolphin  "i wanna die"   Puts a smile on my face  Since you feel like you no reason to love yourself you can't grasp the idea of someone loving you  Hoping for the best for you  I made it about a year off meds before shit got real and I crashed REALLY REALLY hard and ended up back in the hospital  Good luck  Eh if you wanna talk to someone pm me  I ain't doing much and I'm a very tolerant person  If we have some similar interests we can chill and talk about that  Up to you I don't mind just doing muh thing over here  Same  Ok  Honestly I have inferiority complex from me  and sometimes my parents  comparing myself to my sister  This makes it really hard for me to ask for help  I've started asking for help  but swallowing pride is a challenge    But I will try harder  Thank you very much      Thou hast journey'd far  and overcome much  chosen Undead  Come hither  child    Stop lying to yourself  I'm sure you're not unwanted i live in the US  it's considered a disability but if you can't show up to a job they don't really care why  My take on Lamictal  "Primarily useful for convincing your pdoc to prescribe you something actually helpful "  My take on Latuda  "There's an antipsychotic that improves my mood and treats my psychosis without making me fat  stupid  tired  or generally miserable   Slap me  I must be dreaming "  Sorry your mom didn't tell you  that's kinda shitty of her    How bipolar has affected me  I went from an ENTP who wanted to make a career mathematically modelling human behavior to an ENFP who wants to make a career helping people cope with their emotions as a therapist  I also decided to find out a lot about neuroscience and psychiatric drugs   I've learned what meds help most for what symptoms  what risks are safer to take and which to never take  I've learned it's important to talk about your feelings  but also that it's important for that that talking happen with people you trust  I've definitely come to appreciate the importance of taking care of myself better as I've aged  Idk  If you have more specific questions I'm happy to do my best to answer them  I'm 27  diagnosed  January 2010  and on Latuda and Lamictal  among others   I find that this feeling of being an outsider doesn't go away even when I am participating in things  since I can only ever go through the motions and essentially fake it  So I'm there physically  but just as disconnected on an emotional level as I ever was   I've gotten my doctor to write a note to my college so my professors were lenient on my attendance  but i don't think the job i have would care whether or not i was depressed  just if i showed up  i agree that just going is easier but it's really hard for me to even get the motivation to get ready at all  especially if it's in the morning  I'm perfectly fine in the evening  My advisor had to scheduled my classes next semester to later times so i would actually go  i don't live on campus   Depression just sucks all around  Glad your husband supports you like he does  That sucks  Is your boss the understanding type  I think I feel kind of similar to you right now  For me I feel scared to get professional help but at the same time know there is no real alternative considering how deep into depression I am  If you feel the same maybe we could encourage eachother  I have no real advice that you probably haven't heard before  Racism exists  Homophobia exists  So  Both of those things I have to experience first hand and experience all the issues from that  Being a straight white man you have better chances than me though   Thank you for the reply though    What's the quickest I can titrate lamictal without dying   The speed at which your doctor tells you  You are asking for medical advice that no one here is qualified to give  The risk of SJS might be quantifiable  but it's also highly variable and there are genes that affect risk levels   Lamictal is supposed to help a little with depression  but is more useful for preventing episodes  okay  specifically worded as "reducing the frequency of " which to me is the same thing  than treating them  Most people don't think they're bipolar at first  Usually those people still benefit from medication  I feel defeated Exactly what i was thinking  You think it's gone for a few days and it comes back to hit even harder  This made me want to replay the first Dark Souls     You should You'd have to do what I do everyday for that to happen I can't give you any tips since I'm in the same boat but I wish you good luck    You're not alone  this feels terrible  When you're in debt and lost everything  We'll sort it out i'm sure  When I saw the title I thought oh we're our own race of Depressed people Sounds like anhedonia  Could be dysthymia   But hey  don't  rely on the internet for diagnoses   You're in Norway  so you've got decent healthcare  right  Ask a psychologist  an MD  whatever sort of experts you can afford   Your problem could be psychological  hormonal  etc  All I can do is guess  I don't even have the energy I just feel mentally and emotionally trapped  Installing in progress  Thanks for sharing  It's beautiful  I could care less if you have depression  Just don't be an asshole  I don't want to be in a relationship with an asshole guy   i dunno man  take it easy    His favorite spot is his bed  sleeping problems  irritability  social isolation  and has gained 40kg since he lost his last job 10 y o  It's just not worth it   im proud of you buddy  its the little things that can mean a whole lot  keep it up     I wish you good luck with it  Even if it is hard  there is nothing to loose     Let us know how your 2017 is going  Could one learn to be depressed just to justify their laziness   Subconsciously of course I lost all my friends this year  so no  I don't celebrate anything anymore  I also had hobbies before and interests two was reading and science but yeah I feel you I just don't have the energy to Dean with those things now  Even music which used to always make me happy even for just a few seconds just makes me ten times more sad and disgusted with myself  The putting on the mask in front of others is me every single day  Thanks  I've already ask my mother to book an appointment with my doctor to see if maybe there's something else we can do  In the meantime  I'm gonna be hella busy tomorrow with all the work that I haven't been able to finish yet  So I'll need that good luck  and I wish the same to you Yeah  I know that feeling  Someone once described it to me as feeling like you're carrying a hundred pounds on your back while all those other people are carrying a thousand   But really  it's not everyone else who matters  it's YOU  If you notice that you're feeling like shit  it's more than okay to get someone to help you carry that weight  I think that it is when you have the explanation why something is wrong  things that once felt wrong are now explained  What I mean is that when I was younger  many things did not feel normal   Too many nightmares as a kid  random fears  not being able to "fit in" as a teenager   altough this one is common amongst teens    constant fear  but idealisation of death  mood swings     Once I was certain that I had depression  it all made sense  I always kind of knew something was wrong  but now it could be explained  I just wanted to make space for the sequels     T                                                                                Everything in my life is OK but I don't feel this way My mom still making fun of me in front of people  blaming me for her lack of money Everytime I'm alone I go in a really dark place     Everyday is a struggle  I can't really breath  I'm fighting to not start over my bad habits 3 months clean Not doing great at all  Wow  I can relate a lot to you  I feel like I have no purpose in life other than being a parasite and it makes me suicidal  Why live if I have no purpose  I don't have any friends and will never have and I can't even make friends  do you expect me to find a gf  Ha  what a joke  Everytime I log on any social media all I see are happy people  and it makes me feel like shit  I HAD people I called friends but I just fucked shit up and now I'm alone  The only thing that keeps me alive is the fact that I know my family will suffer with my suicide  but more in a financial way than a sentimental one  I'm about to turn 15 and I feel the same way  Thankfully nobody has told me to spend so much time on my PC in a long time  My mom says that I'm better off sitting here in my room all day  rather than what some other kids are already doing like drinking alcohol  smoking etc  wot rings u got bithc Well unless you have a 100 gb hdd    you done goofed Hey  15 too  I'm here if you ever need to talk or vent  being lonely is shit I don't even believe things will get better anymore If you're going to abandon her anyway there's no need to kill yourself to do that  Otherwise you should consider if you can raise the child or are willing to put it up for adoption  Otherwise an abortion might be your only option  Definitely both  most of the times the first one causes the second one  A lot of depressed people are the ones  usually introverts  who are smarter  have an artistic vision or just analyze everything or think too much  all of them at times causing isolation and depression  and when they get depressed they can't help but keep on thinking much  It's really a fucked up cycle isn't it   Yep and this further proves my point that people only use you then cast you aside when you need help I spent the entire evening worried about how we're gonna afford groceries after paying rent and bills  I didn't share this with her so I was just this solemn melancholy ass all night     This is exactly what I said last year    and   the year before  on New Years Eve  Nothing is going to change   It's sad  They don't seem to care whether people get health care or not  One of my cousins has type 1 diabetes and even with good insurance it's costly   I don't have health insurance so I haven't been to a doctor in a couple years  I can't afford to see a counselor therapist   I believe the outcome of this election has made depression worse for some  It's scary   Abortion is the ONLY option here  It's better for both of you and the child  You're already posting here on a depression sub  do you really feel like you're capable of raising another human being  that child is gonna grow up and feel like shit because his her parents never wanted him her  It's the most wrong thing to do from depressed people to have a child  Please tell your girlfriend to abort it and save yourself all the drama  suicide is not an option since you can end all this pain with a medical alternate  stay focused and strong dude  it'll pass   Sounds like we certainly have something in common  haha  I'm sorry things are shitty  You say you feel like a parasite  but also that your family relies on you financially  At least if you are contributing to them financially  you are not really a parasite at all  Maybe your friends can forgive you for whatever it is that happened  I don't know your story  but I know your pain   I know its tough thinking about this  but don't think the worst   If you've been a good employee  this should  at worst  be a warning  assuming there's not more going on than we know about   When he talks to you  tell him you had your phone off to allow yourself to relax and recharge during your time off  and that you responded to him when you got the message   Tell him that if he has critical tasks  he shouldn't rely on a text message to deliver them   If he brings up 'attitude' problems  tell him you were under stress and exhausted before Christmas  and that you're sorry if it appeared that you were having a bad attitude  People forget to mention mental disorders fall on a spectrum  If you're on the extreme end  regular meds are absolutely required  The brain is completely unable to reliably regulate its own activity  so it must rely on pills to do the job for it  Kind of similar to type 1 diabetes   So  do you need meds  You can't rely on others' opinions  You have to rely on your own personal evaluation of your situation  with the help of a good pdoc   Some people need pills 24 7  Others only need it during winter  and major life events  Others only need it during severe life changing events    I believe the more severe sufferers frequent this subreddit  since they need more group support  and therefore you will see a lot of "You have to take your meds every day "  Whether you need meds 24 7  or not  you need to find and keep a good pdoc     for regular checkups  and in case of emergencies   I can't stress the "good" part enough  There are an alarming number of bad pdocs  including the ones who don't care  and therefore fail you in your time of extreme need  Think of it like this  I hate myself when I do just anythung  The only thing I know how to do is absolutely nothing  When I wanted to hang myself because I didn't see the point in life  Still don't see a point  for many years i was denying to call my troubles depression because i believed it was a part of who i am  I thought it's part of my identity  to drown in swamps of gloom and anxiety  Besides after bad day next one was ok ish so  it's normal me not an illness  I was so afraid medication will alternate my personality  Currently i am also heavy medicated  but i understand now  that depression was the one alternating my personality  Drugs didn't made me fully normal but i am more myself than without them  Turns out controlling sadness every second and suppressing all emotions is not part of my nature  But i still feel guilty calling myself depressed  is it just bad stigma of mental illness and overusing depression to describe any crying spells in one  I feel guilty even to try to say I understand you or that I am in similar state  even if in my mind formulates the same sentences of confusion on who am I  Only thing I am sure about is  depression is not part of my integrity and I deserve a pill a day to maintain my individualism  I am with you in looking for understanding where do I belong   New Years is always my worst day  I spend it alone  I cry  I shake  I give in to my anxiety  I break down  The next day  I always think  "Maybe this year will treat me better"   Then  on the first day of the year  I am always reminded why I want to commit suicide   When i get her back im going to PM you  Im not giving up  She's my girl   Very fucked up  Sorry  I can't help with the age thing  I'm only eighteen myself  and I was diagnosed a few months ago   The three drugs I've tried so far are Latuda  Tegretol  and Lamictal    I HATED Latuda  I know for a lot of people it's their miracle drug  but I was sleeping 14  hours a day on only 20mg  I did feel a bit better  but  hypo mania and depression kept on seeping through  so my pdoc had me quit   thank god   Now I'm on Tegretol for mania and Lamictal for depression  They're both very mild drugs  which is why I'm trying these before the ones with more severe side effects  like lithium and depakote   I'm still on very low doses of both  going to up them after my appt tomorrow   but they seem to be working  I have energy changes  in that some days I talk a lot of don't sleep as much  and others I do the exact opposite  but those changes come without the corresponding mood swings  if that makes sense  As in  I'm not actually sad when I'm in a "depressed" phase  just tired  So I think that's a good sign  and hopefully higher doses will help even more  I also haven't had any side effects yet  which I'm really pleased about  Whoever you are  I believe in you  You can make it through this because you're awesome    i feel lonely thing is i have friends  its a weird feeling   I believe in you  You can pull through this  Take as much time as you need for recovery     You're amazing  An endless neverending fucked up cycle of despair Im actually on Latuda currently and it is causing me some problems  Thanks  I hope I can   I have some friends and a brother  I feel that relationships tend to always complicate things and create more problems than they solve  Because it's fun  and fun is what we all want  It's just that everyone's definition of fun isn't the same  Thank you for letting me know    Glad to hear im not the only one having trouble with Latuda Thank you so much for your reply  At first it can even make you feel worse  and at times increase anxiety  but after a while it will do what it's supposed to like calm you down  make you a little bit more relaxed  a little more focused and it helps you sleep at night  But it has it's downsides  you might feel tired  restless and sometimes even more unmotivated  lazy  etc     all of these aren't even that "big"   just slight changes  I've been using it for more than 2 years now  50 mg  Even though i believe it doesn't work anymore i'm scared of putting it away because not taking it makes me feel dizzy and nauseous   I experiment a lot with different pills  drugs    i know it's fucked up but it's my pursuit of happiness  feel free to ask more questions   Agreed   Yeah I'm asking that   could the fact that you hate yourself just a way to defend yourself against accusations of laziness  Nothing is fun to me    I don't see anything as fun New year or not it's always the same shit   me too What will you all play  Right now the 4 man meta appears to be Barb  Monk  WD x2 or Barb  Monk x2  WD  I'll probably breakout my monk if we want to bring a good four man  I don't play Barb or WD though   Yes    Almost if not all mood stabilizers can cause drowsy groggy zombie effects what about lamictal   agmantine instead    Very relevant comic  http   www depressioncomix com posts 191   Just remember that you're not alone in the world and you can do it  I got better  I learned how to function  That's what helped me the most  I can help myself when I have dips in the road because I know what it looks like  You have to be willing to put in the work  If you're young  that can also do it  I'm 25 now  super depressed currently  but I know how to get better  I'm currently waiting on my medications to help me  I had to get off cymbalta since it stopped working and will hopefully take emsam again soon  I've been really down  but I can take care of myself now and know how to get the help I need   Is it better to take it in the evening   Thanks means a lot   Just do something for yourself then  Eat something you like  watch a movie or something  Make the date be just an excuse for you to do something nice  Honestly i don't think this is the kind of guy you want to associate with anyway  Best thing you can do in the new year is try to move on If you ever need someone to vent to  you can PM me  Good luck with everything    Because you're here    life doesn't exist for a purpose  but instead because it can    However  make no mistake that you are unique  The atoms in your body  the memories in your brain  there has never been anything built just like you  and there never will be  It's not that you don't have skills  it's that you haven't found yours yet  or developed them    nobody starts off knowing themselves  nobody starts off good at anything  Nobody  Pretty sure that's exclusive to physically disabled people and is difficult to do regardless  Don't kill yourself dude i was hurt the same way so many times by my "friends" i learned to live without them  Probably not best advice ever    I just have good colleagues in work but no high hopes for any closeness  If i change job tomorrow  i will stop talking to them and not even cry about it  Even better to forget  I wish they will forget the little piece of    misery I am    Thanks for the feedback  I know exactly how you feel  My best friend cut me off because of things that happened when we were in high school  She was never the most stable but    it still hurts  Missing them like you miss the sun on your face  All the problems  everything would be acceptable just to be able to know that they want you again   I know how you feel    But it gets better    or it can  It takes time  It hurts  But it can    Would you like to talk  If so I'd very much like someone to talk to too    pm or reply  ok  thank you for answering   Everything is going out of control  And my life is the only thing I'm still able to have in my hand  Getting out is gonna be my best bet to fix everything  Of course  And seriously  don't hesitate to ask any questions  Nonsense  Who says you're repulsive  And more then that  there are many who wouldn't care    is that drug the general anesthesia they give before the procedure  was it only short term memory  how many treatments did u have and for how long  was there short term improvement and then it faded with lack of treatments  I know a lot of questions but the more you could tell me the better  I'd really appreciate it  Dropping out isn't the same as fixing anything  You're right that you have a choice here  Choose to live What kind of light thearpy  What kind of light thearpy  Do you have a wave length  It's possible but generally a lot more difficult than with effective meds  People can have a good few years before symptoms return  If you choose not to use meds then I think the most important thing is to really jump on it and do something at the beginning of a depressive  but particularly a manic episode    New Years is always my worst day   Man  so fucking true  For many others  it's NYE   but for me  the first day of the New Year  the first of many days that just will not be good is absolutely terrifying     Nah  there is nothing that can be done but yeah it sucks  I hope you manage  since I really can't help you    Well that sounds    weird  Yeah that definitely sounds pretty abnormal  I'd have a chat to your group if you haven't yet about him  see what everyone else makes of it  and also does he have any like proper anger management issues or something   I should also specify  it's usually NYE New Years  As in  around midnight  That's when my anxiety attacks start to lose their shit  I don't know dude   I don't like eating anymore    and eating is expensive  I don't need an excuse to do anything  it would be meaningless of I fabricated some reason to do something "enjoyable celebratory"     I don't need fun in my life I just read through a couple dozen of these and I can completely relate to 95  of these  Some I feel I could have written myself  i e  They used the exact same words going around in my head      thank you again  I hope you had a good new year  I'm feeling like there's nothing wrong again and I'm just lazy   how do you tell the difference  I know I'm repeating myself  I'm sorry  my head goes round in circles  I hate myself for being so lazy  but then I don't have the energy motivation to do anything    Like I can still function normally and laugh etc so surely there's nothing that wrong  Yes  I was also very glad when I found those  Those are very helpful when explaining it to healthy people  The comics also deal with the effect depression has on partners or friends    I saved dozens of them because I identify that much with many of those  I went to bed at 1015 pm and it felt wonderful to wake up at a normal hour  fully rested and no hangover  I'd take that over most other ways last night could have gone  It depends on the province you're in  As I suspect each province is different  In B C  I had to get on wage assistance first to make it easier for the Disability to be approved   I was also told by everyone I saw  and recommend this myself  go to an advocacy group first  They will create a case file  Fill out the paperwork with you and write a letter to your doctor instructing him how to properly fill it out and phrase it in such a way that it's more "acceptable" to the government  In B c  not only did I need a doctor but I needed a secondary person as well  I used my psych as my secondary person and my family doctor as my main  Once all parts are filled in you need to mail it to the government  Depending on backlog waiting on status could be a while  I submitted mine end of August 2015 and was approved end of December 2015    If you are not approved at first  you can appeal the decision  This is where having a file with the advocacy group comes in handy  because they will help you with the appeal process  Whereas if you're on your own   then you've got to figure it out yourself    In B C  the Disability status is permanent  So long as you keep your papers  If you leave B c  then return after 10 years  if you resubmit your acceptance paper your disability will be reinstated    Once again though  I highly recommend you check out your local disability alliance  They will hold your hand through everything   I actually found some movies very helpful when at my lowest point a few months back     Two Days  One Night   is a very sad movie about depression but I think it's ultimately uplifting  It reminded me that there were reasons to go on  and that even if things don't work out the struggle is worth it      Happy Go Lucky   encouraged me to be more optimistic  not in a delusional or fantasy kind of way  but because rolling with the punches life gives you feels like the most productive way to live    They both helped me through rough times but everyone's mileage will very   Video games and a lot of it  You're definitely not alone  Latuda made me vomit almost every night   P   Edit  But lamictal probably saves my life every day  So good stuff is out there   P I hope I get my shit together finally in 2017  else I don't know what I am gonna do  I wish for all of you to come out of this shit too  this mental torture  Same here  I came on this site to hopefully find people who felt like I do in hopes that I wouldn't feel so alone  I'm always here to talk if you need someone  Wish I could help you  but you're posting your question in the most wrong subreddit on here  I usually "celebrate" by watching Syfy's Twilight Zone marathon  It's been an on and off tradition for many years now  Still felt like shit and went to bed early though  I couldn't sleep at all last night thinking like that  I feel ya bro   I saw the Shawshank Redemption some months ago  Almost had to cry at the ending  It's not a movie about depression but it's also about living without hope  living in restraints  being desperate    I can also recommend Road to Perdition  Also a very beautiful movie   And I don't know how helpful it actually is but watching Fight Club again also was one of my depression movies  The futility of ones life  loneliness  self destruction and sleeplessness among other things are just things I was able to relate to    First season Daredevil also was good   I recently made this list of  movies I can recommend  https

 I'm going to my pdoc Tuesday morning  and telling him that shit has hit the fan  broken it  and the blades are flying into pieces  Sometimes I am able to help myself  other times it feels overwhelming  but somehow I need to get there  Thank you for your words  I wish you luck and hope you can get what you need and where you need to be too I take my Lamictal in the evening   my doctor advised me to do so to avoid any tiredness side effects      Hi     Come talk  i don't want you to go   Same for me today  too    I feel the same  I try to focus my mind on things like roleplaying and such  Still it's very hard  but humans are superb on surviving  Welcome   My mother had borderline  and it helped me a lot at having insight into my own condition  so yay for having a bit of a leg up due to experience in the field   I'm not sure about what comes first  but there's a couple of things you ideally could would do simultaneously  the times stated are for me  I'm BP1 and no one is an average case  YMMV      Accept what you have  and that it's for life  This took quite a while for me  I think about 2 years  It's not the same as  accepting I'm depressed right now but I'm going to get better and I will never  have to worry about it  It's a case of  I need to make some lifestyle choices that other people don't have to make  and I have to carefully monitor my moods and major life decisions  For life  Therapy helps a lot with this    Sort out your meds  That's both filling off the extreme edges of mood swings  crippling depression and mania   but also cutting down if you start becoming too flat too dumb  That process took me about 1 5 years  and I'm still tuning a bit    Start practicing self care and routines  This might sound stupid if you're not in a depression right now  but that means regular shower body hygiene  regular meals that are not entirely shit  some regular exercise  regular sleeping  regular regularity  Alcohol  caffeine  tobacco  in moderation  Some swear by abstinence  they might be right  And  above all   you probably know this   impeccable medication hygiene  Create a habit of taking your meds  always carry a days supply  etc    This paragraph was for me the really long and exhausting part  I'm never going to finish this  and I've already relapsed quite a bit from my good weeks    I barely involve any of my family or friends in my illness  But I have discovered a trick to getting people to see the severity of it  and give them space to ask questions  Drag them to your psychiatrist  Mine was open to the idea  and my siblings were a lot more receptive to a person with a degree nailed to the wall telling them I was seriously ill  then their little brother saying he was    I can imagine that having a loving and supporting fiance is a great help  You probably will have to learn to care for yourself  before you can teach others how to care for you  But I have also noticed my father  who I live with  is a good second opinion on my mood swings  and he has a better memory  so he's a good authority on how I've evolved over long periods   Sorry for the rambling  writing is how I order my broken mind    Good luck  Check out this

take medications or see a therapist  I did have a while where I had crying spells at work and they adjusted my medications and it helped   Those are a lot of the things I've struggled with  so yeah I do get what you're feeling  Your university's doctors should be a big help  I know mine are disclaimer  i don't know your situation or the people around you as well as you do  so if this seems like a bad idea  don't do it  also i don't generally advocate lying    I know how you feel  maybe you could try telling people you aren't actively suicidal  but you are passively suicidal  that may or may not be true  but if they don't think you'll actually try anything  you may not be institutionalized but you will still get help  it seems like a decent way to let people know how you're actually feeling without worrying them to the point of sending you off somewhere   however  if there is someone who knows you better and whom you trust more than the person you told last time  tell them the truth  you've probably heard this a thousand times  but they legit care about you and want the best for you   Sadly you're a couple of hours away so i can't give you a hug we can talk if you like I know where you're coming from with the worthless humanities degree  I'm a Psychology major   which can lead to great things if you want to spend three more years in Grad school  Like you though  I despise school  Always have  Sucks  doesn't it  If anything  it makes you want to end up with a job you enjoy because you know what it's like to dread what you have to do day in and day out  I'm sure you've explored your avenues  but I just feel the need to throw this in there  I love the medical field  but have no interest in a medical degree  I realized a lot of Psyc classes apply to Occupational Therapy  so I plan to go on to become and OT  I'm sure you've looked at similar things with your degree  but that's just a thought  I've struggled with anxiety for a long time now  and I think depression is starting to become an issue as well  It's such a shame  shame is an understatement  that so many college students struggle with mental health as an effect of school  Anyway  I do hope you can find something meaningful and enjoyable to do with your life  And everyone can find someone to spend their lives with  even in the most unexpected ways  Good luck to you  Big step  Way to go  Glad your parents are behind you  Good luck at the doctor's  Hey  just thought you should know that I did the same on my Facebook about 15 mins ago  Already got a fair few likes     Haha  Feels good to have finally done it  Thanks for the advice and Happy New Year   Recently someone send me a text about how to deal social anxiety that actually  could  help me    But I'm too afraid to hope  I don't have any will to get better anymore  There is a small part in me that wants help and a bigger part that just doesn't care anymore and a large part that just hates this body and this existence and wants to harm and punish it  I keep self sabotaging myself    I can't mentally grasp that I wasted my life  No matter if it was the illness or myself  I can't forgive myself  I can't accept my past  I don't have anything to look forward in the future  There are so many things that erode my selfworth that aren't related to my SA and that won't go away   I can relate to many of your points  Omg man can I ask you something   I wanted to make a post on this sub about it  but I don't think many would relate    You enjoy the humor or stuff like  r 2meirl4meirl  right  That dolphin pic sounds like I saw it there    So my question is   do you find  r wholesomememes irritating at all  I feel db but it makes me angry  and I still can't fully believe people are being sincere there  but then again they can't believe "our" humor either  Anyhoo wondering what you thoufht Awesome  I struggle with taking care of myself too  I don't know why it's so hard to want to shower and brush my teeth  I'm also type 2 diabetic and I struggle to check my bs and inject myself  My numbers are high a lot bc of this  I want to love myself enough to take care of myself  especially since I really want children  If I can't take care of myself  how can I care for another human being  It's hard  Good job on reaching your goal  Honestly  I don't have many great suggestions for you because I'm struggling with the same things right now  Sometimes I feel great  and most of those times are when I'm with my boyfriend  When I'm not  depression can pop up very readily  One thing that does help me is spending time with my pets  I have a dog and two kittens   even though they can't really help you or talk about what's going on  it does help to have something there to love on  I've only had one severe panic attack  but I laid on the floor with my dog near the end of it and it was far better than sitting there alone  I know this wasn't a lot of help  but just know you aren't the only one  If you find it continues  maybe try talking to someone  I tried and it's not my thing  but I'm planning to meet with a different psychologist and see if we "click" better  I know that seems drastic  but it's always an option  I hope you can start building more and more positivity in your life  good luck to you  Aw man that's fucked  I'm so sorry    like  actually  My heart hurt reading that  and that's rare  The image of crying to fireworks    Man that's like a brilliantly morose movie scene or something     I cried watching new year's concerts online  So much cheer and everyone hopes    this will sound unbelievable it would to me if i was still depressed  but it does get better  its unfortunate that new years eve wasnt so great for you  i wish you to have a better day tomorrow even if you may still feel very depressed about everything but hopefully it will be better in some way or form       and i hope your health problems will get resolved soon  as ive had my fair share of them  they can be very stressful to deal with  Good to know  thanks so much   Ooh  holy shit  that's what I'm thinking and imagining too  I imagine that I am that person standing on some kind of metaphorical edge border and using binoculars to look into the area of happenings  It's like I'm only an observer that never stops observing everything possible  but be never part of the others  the happenings  Lol 12 15 I logged in here  P How old are you     Wow that's a very helpful sheet  thank you  I've studied the DSM V but never seen the criteria broken down like that  Thanks again  Sameeeee  similar to u firefades I'm not quite there geographically  I'm down in ol Landan town  so can't oblige in person    Sending a massive one virtually though  hope you're okay    That's good to know  thanks  I'm not a fan of opening up and talking to people  but hearing that it's helped makes it seem a little better  Hope you're feeling well   Thank you for the sentiment  It's not much but it does help  Definitely a possibility  Mood stabilizers frequently cause that  On lamictal I was often groggy and tired  but on lithium it was like I could not ever keep my eyes open  Taking it at night helps  but it becomes super important to always get a full night of sleep either way  If it's a burden to play then you can always put it down for later Of course you deserve to be happy  You may not see it right now  but you're an amazing person  seriously  It wouldn't be better if you died  I know there's people out there who care about you  I believe in you  you can get through this rough spot  You're great    I am so happy for you you are on the path to find your happiness  "comparison is the thief of joy" I have heard of somewhere on reddit    I know what you mean  I feel like saying you like to watch movies may sound more socially acceptable  eye roll  to people  Would that work  Agmatine doesn't have much human research for psychiatric purposes  Since it inhibits NMDA receptors without inhibiting AMPA receptors it would probably be synergistic  but it's hard to say  please feel free to pm me if you need to vent  Do you have the resources to talk to someone  Some people hate the idea  including myself  I did it  but things have gotten worse again so I'm going to make myself revisit that option   Even if it isn't your favorite  it may help to get that initial "boost" out of feeling like you're in a hole  Situations like this  and I certainly don't know the extent of yours  are so difficult because there aren't a lot of options  Seeing a professional is certainly one  Medication does help some people  you just have to know that it's a route you're ready to take  One of my biggest fallbacks is my dog  Having a pet is huge for some people  so if you're able to go love on a dog

to feel better  I was super anxious  had flu like symptoms  it was rough  My doctor prescribed me Xanax to help with the transition    After the side effects wore off  my anxiety definitely has decreased  but not as much as it was with my previous medicine  I think Zoloft actually increased my depression  It made me have suicidal thoughts    I'm talking to my Dr about it later this week  I hope it gets better for you   Happy New Year  Dude keep going and go to the doctor to make sure you don't have spinal problem  I was the top student for all of my life high school college  Getting good grades will not make you happy forever there are so many things in the world that do not need good grades In my book  just try to find your own talent and dont make your self confidence miserable your self confidence needs your help   I can relate dude  I threw a project X party on New Years Eve 3 years ago and my friend took all the credit  Join a club of your interest  What are your passions or hobbies I'm so fucking lonely and depressed  the only reason I'm alive is my mom and dad  I love them too much to cause them the trauma of their kid dying  But I'm so lonely that it literally hurts me physically   My stomach hurts  my chest hurts  my head hurts   Everything  hurts   Okay thank you  I'm going to start taking it at night now  I'm surprised my doctor didn't warn me   Every time I get close to a point where I think I'm happy it's taken away  Like some kind of sick cosmic joke Thanks I relate to this so hard  Sadness for me is a positive state  Am always grateful for movies that make me cry  it feels like someone broke open my soul and unclogged my emotions  In my case sad songs aren't as effective as sad movies  or some documentary about orphaned babies  I suggest you keep on watching tearjerker movies and may be with time crying will come easily to you  And btw isn't Rick and Morty supposed to be funny   Edit  Have you watched Adrien Brody's movie Detachment  think it might resonate a lot with you   This is so true  Incredible  seeing this exact description of where I'm at at the moment  gave me some feeling of confidence  I guess  Wow  Thanks appreciate it and

Only an extreme small amount do try and the majority of here is just for venting and unfortunately the comments are shallow  And on top of that a lot of the post in my opinion are kids  For me it took a few months to show any improvement  For me  it didn't work as well as I liked so I switched to pristiq and I really like it  I can really tell if I don't take it  They say to wait at least 3 6 months before calling it quits on a medication because some of them take a little longer to build up in your system to a useable level  Hang in there for another month and see how you feel  you never know  it could start having an affect in the next week or so  Best of wishes   I think first step is to go docters and then go from there  Also change my lifestyle and do more postive things is where I will start  I want a dog but where I live in a rented house we are not allowed one I don't know if I'll be able to keep with the responsibility just yet anyway I just want to concentrate on getting better  Change yourself  just to be better   I am human and so are you  We are supposed to have flaws issues  We need to upgrade ourselves  Never ever be an outdated app  We all go through rough spots in life and for some people it just takes longer to get out of it  I'm really proud of you for continuing to try to be happy again  I know it's super hard to  You're worth it and later in life you won't regret trying to pull yourself out of this  You're great    Well done  and don't forget about your gums too  Give them a healthy light 'brushing' as well    Good job   Are you sure  What do you

abuse  treatment resistant schizophrenia  Alzheimer's  Parkinson's  borderline personality disorder    really with anything involving glutamatergic neurotoxicity or oxidative stress it might provide a small benefit   I like it for unipolar depression at 200 mg  but I've just started that dose so we'll see whether it still works in a couple months  100 mg did nothing noticeable  but also had no side effects  Neither dose helps with anxiety  I think it's a good idea to see someone and go from there  Often times they have thoughts that you're able to consider in the furthering of your life change  Renting a house with a dog is definitely tough  I hope whoever you see is able to be a helpful influence  good luck  Alot of people say after suicide attempts like the second they jumped or cut their artery or whatever they instantly regretted it and wanted to go back  those that survive say they're thankful they didn't die  I'm curious on how you view the attempt failing  As a good thing   Hey  good to see isn't it  actually being able put it into words  I've been in a dark place and one of old friend sent me that  I was in amazement when I read it  It does give you confidence stay strong friend  Recent college grad with nowhere to go  until next year   I have no friends so I "celebrated" new years alone in my bed  I have nothing to do and bored all day everyday    I can barely make it out of bed and when I realize I have nothing to do  nowhere to go  and no friends to talk to I go right back to my bed and contemplate why I'm here  I want to experience what the world has to offer but I either can get past my bed  social anxiety  or disassociating  On a good note  less thoughts about harming myself   So yeah  that's my check in for the week   I know that feeling  i kinda regret telling my doctor ive been feeling suicidal its just been a mess and made me feel like they cant do much  i am on prosac now which well see what that does  nothing so far  so i dont really know if its worth it  i know it should be I felt like I don't deserve being happy    And that "happy me" was responsible for all this mess and so blind that he couldn't see it  Anything was preferable to that  She sounds like an awful person troubled by a lot of issues  Don't let her being a fucking nut bag be the cause for you ending your life  Not everyone's parents love them  not everybody was intended  but I like to feel that everybody has a purpose  You might not be aware of what it is yet but shouldn't you allow yourself time to find it     I am more physically oriented  but totally   Mmm    In short  it's good because someone is on your side    Do you take any anxiety medications by chance   Sometimes when I'm low I like to think of scenarios like this  say for example you're walking out of a shop or whatever and you hold a door open for a lady  a lady who by all intents and purposes was going to go home and kill herself but you holding this door open restored just an ounce of hope in her  Next day she wins the lottery and starts up a charity organisation helping millions of people  as a direct result of your actions  Hmm  Personal experience here  I had a nervous breakdown in my second year of college  At that point  all of my friends left me isolated me  No bueno  I dropped out of school and took about a year to learn how to be a real person again  Which is where I am now  back in college  College kids suck   Hardcore   My friends now are all 25 35 and that's been a huge benefit  I will hang out with my classmates to socialize and do homework together but I'm not going to put my emotional welfare in the hands of kids who don't know how to be kind and graceful  Disclaimer  I'm still learning too  I like older people  who realize that they don't have to justify their worth and existence to everyone around them  It's excellent   Of course  everyone is different and everyone's experience is different  But it seriously helped me  Keep your chin up   I was sure I was going to be alone for the rest of my life when a random conversation with a stranger led me to my entire new friend group  read   Yikes  I'm sorry all this shit is happening in your life  OP  You may be going through a rough patch right now  but I know that you can get through this  I'm sure if you reached out to talk to your mother that you need her support  she would gladly help you out  It's awesome you found a new girl that you like though  I'm sure  even if you can't physically be with her  she can help you through a lot  I believe in you  You can do this  You're a great person  It's totally normal to feel fine for years  But unfortunately when symptoms come back they can come on suddenly  That's the worst feeling  My ex boyfriend and I were best friends before we dated   right after he just completely stopped acknowledging me as a person whatsoever  It sucks a ton but people you love treating you shittily usually has a lot more to do with them than you  Thank you  I think before you deny yourself fulfilling your potential you should atleast ask yourself 1 question  have you tried everything  Therapy  Medication  Hell even just getting high helps some people cope  It's a very sad thing when depression overcomes one of us  were all soldiers fighting the same war  stay strong friend  3  Please don't end your life  You aren't worthless  You may be going through a rough patch at the moment  but you can make it through this  You're an amazing person and I believe in you     thanks man  actually  I'm not sure I can  I'm a fighter  but I lack the motivation atm  like why go forward  what for  I talked to my mom about needing her support  she's kinda indifferent  she favors my ex a lot  in the past she even told me that if we ever should split up  she's keeping her  I didn't do anything to provoke such comments from her  she just likes my ex so much for some reason  just shit stuff  glad I can even stay here atm  as for the girl  I wanna avoid putting any of this on her  I don't want a relationship revolving around my issues  I can't deal with them  she couldn't either  I will tell her about some of these things  but really  I can't expose her to the full extent of this  as she has anxiety issues as well  thank you for your kind words though  I appreciate you found the time to read through this and respond  thanks ill try that sub  So it doesn't really resolve anything just turns it down a little bit  I'm in 2 minds about them because I don't really want to become dependant on them for the rest of my life  But at the same time one can only fight mental illness for so long before caving in and collapsing  Dude stop helping people and be selfish  Your dad is bullshit and his stupid retarded ideology  It is good to be positive THAT IS IF YOUR OPTUMISTIC and look into the future knowing it will get better  And realistically you should only do things for others if they want it and don't care about how you feel unless you are are happy because they are content and obviously thankful  You should NOT do it because YOU think they need it or it makes you happy by giving shit away because there is a lot of people who are selfish and don't care and only want things  Especially if you might be doing it for recognition  it never will come  The shit you see on tv or reddit front page is a rare chance of recognition and sometimes for stupid people who happen to catch the publics eyes    Is this your money or your parents  If it is your parents  stop wasting it  If it is your do whatever you want    You know what it means to help people but you don't understand what it means to help people  You do a whole shit load of things but you haven't done alot of individual social worker things for the LONG term because they are the only who sit down and actually try to help people improve their life or cope  Your just giving pieces of yourself away for absolutely no goddamn reason but that fact that it is suppose to make you happy or see a glimps of a difference that you don't even know if you help create change or not    Forget helping people and be selfish for yourself for the time being  Go out and have fun  Experience life on your own terms  No some shit you need to do that it becomes a chore  People prey on nice people like you  They absolutely give two shits what you feel  Look man first have fun and understand what it means to make a difference and this time be more stingy in who you help  your not a millionare and this isn't a movie where everyone is thankful when you help every stranger  Such strange times this new year is bringing  Horrible to say but this is true   Really hope not for everyone  I'm scared to get professional help because I don't want my friends and family to know I'm suffering  No one wants to know someone close to them is in pain  Maybe a part of me doesn't want to admit it either so I slept the day away  The other view of getting help though is that you're literally getting help  building strength  finding courage and actually opening up  Proving to not only yourself but loved ones that you're getting better  Which   they should he happy with instead of being constantly worried  You seem to know you're at the point you need help  So  If you don't do it for yourself then try thinking about getting help for the ones you care about  I'm not one to say anything bc I know this yet still am not getting help  Namaste  you encouraged just by responding with what you're going through  It's always nice to not feel so alone  To 2017 shedding some light on every person suffering  We'd make some time  I suppose  to learn    might just have been a misunderstanding   Im not sure what could have been misunderstood about plans we had agreed on weeks prior    Besides  you have Internet   Some of the the slowest in the country  but sure  i guess i can enjoy waiting 30 minutes for a 10 minute video to load That is because that is deep down you know you don't want to and not your mind  This is your true self    If this is your first time  it'll never get better next time  It'll only get worse with frequency not because you have them individually but you have them all the time   Put you mind off and do something  Play some epic orchestra music  Just do something  anything  Get out and go for a walk   I highly recommend this one or atleast go to your roof it is late and have a breather  You must be active    However if you don't want to do anything and sit around in the pain  There is nothing you can do except sleep it off  It is always a new day tomorrow  Or maybe talk to a friend or parent  I'm apathetic to it honestly  I tried first by hanging which I gave up on because it hurt  then overdose  I didn't feel bad about it or anything when I initially took the drugs  and I remember thinking when the cop shook me awake "Damn  what does it take to kill me "  I don't really like the fact that I think that way  but I guess it's better than feeling sad about failing  Stay strong buddy  I get that the road ahead might be foggy  but just keep fighting  Maybe ask your mom if she would talk to you without bringing up your ex  As for your girl  make sure you know that she cares for you  and even if she has anxiety issues as well  maybe it's best for her to know some of this  You can keep pulling through this  No work  no job lol  Dying won't beat your problems  it just means they've beaten you  The human mind wants to survive it's a natural instinct  keep fighting  And I promise Oneday you'll think back on the moment you decide to carry on and thank every god  every heaven  every idea that you didn't take your life  Yes   For me it's a part of bpd as well and nor has no much if an identity tbh thank you  actually asked my mom  but she ignored me and kept reading her book  oh well  I will talk to my girl though  you're right  thank you once more  I'm sure you could find something else to do Try to book an appointment with your GP  they are the most qualified to diagnose someone with suspected depression  I've dealt with a bit of loss this year  which I've been able to handle in the past  but on Christmas eve a family friend of my parents died suddenly in a car crash  I think the shock triggered my depression  which I haven't dealt with for about 4 5 years  At first I was skeptical  I felt extremely tired and all I wanted to do was sleep all day  I tried to go to work but I would start panicking and crying  I didn't feel positive emotions like I used to and I find it difficult to do the things I used to love doing  All of these behaviors were out of character for me but I would still convince myself that I was just being a lazy peice of shit because I didn't want to get up and face reality  I  think because my last depression was so intense  loss of hope  cutting  thinking of suicide  I didn't think I had it again  Deep down I know that something is wrong  I was enjoying my work  I used to love reading and being creative  going outside and exploring  That one thought made me race to my GP  because depression is an evil bastard  it will do what it can to stick around  even convince yourself that it isn't there  So take my advice  even if you're second guessing yourself  even if you're tired  book an appointment  it's better to be safe than sorry    no problem  i hope you can find the love and support you need  don't give up on yourself  you're worth it  if you ever need to talk  my pms are open   I understand completely  I've been on a steady spiral downhill slowly for 4years and all of a sudden the past 3months hit me severe of where my life has ended up  Had some clear mindedness today and took a old journal  ripped out all of the years of me writing about sadness  wrote 2017 goals on the cover  Inside cover said 2017 is about dedicating the same amount of effort I put into work  into myself for health and happiness  And wrote out some goals of what to never do again  start doing  financial  fresh start  It was really satisfying  Give it a try  Sometimes I look at the people in my life and I'm confused with how they're satisfied with their lives  living to go out and get drunk on the weekends   For what purpose  I just came to the conclusion that their minds must just not think about things on that level    Thank you for this  You said  in much more eloquent terms of course  exactly what I wanted to say to that OP  Hopefully he feels some relief after reading it  Thanks so much for your reply  If it helps  I'm a philosophy major  I actually love education and am totally fine with the idea of going to graduate school and living my life as an academic  My only problem with the school is the specific one that I'm currently at  I hate the environment  location  size  etc  However  what's keeping me from graduate school is mainly my lack of ability  I'm a good student  but not good enough to make it into a good  funded  PhD program  Even if I could  the job market afterwards would be too horrible to justify the decision  Like you  I have also looked at the medical field  But it's still a matter of my lack of ability  I got a B in gen chem 1 which isn't awful on its own but is definitely not good enough for medical schools  I'm actually continuing to take science classes for the pre med route but I know that eventually I will do poorly in enough of them to force me to do something else  What that something else will be  I have no idea  It's difficult to find a path when you suck at everything  I don't want to do this anymore    r SuicideWatch   r INeedToTalkToSomeone   r KindVoice  1 800 273 8255 Hey   just one brief comment  I'm not qualified  but have read a lot around this area  To me what you're describing sounds like mania  as opposed to hypomania  I suppose I point this out as it makes it a little more serious   potentially  Best to get professional advice on it  anyway  There is a lot of medicine and not every meds for every person  It takes time to find the right one because these meds hurts your organ if you go through alot too rapidly  Thanks  I can't talk to people  it's like a wall or a barrier in my head  Everytime I get close or try I just reach a level of being uncomfortable that's so intense and makes me feel so overcome with anxiety that I feel like I'm going to freak out   Lonliness huh  The hurt is real  I know man  You just wish someone understands you and just one moment where you can get a free handout of friendship where someone pops into your life and simply knows or at least empathize  The worse part of it the arguing is are you right or wrong  You know deep down that answer but you don't accept it because you don't know if it is your fault  Because what you think is not for yourself but what other people think of you  So instead you like to choose it is your fault  Because why not  you are a speck of dust and no one cares  Then sometimes you think why bother as a result  why bother  just give up  But look all you want is some reassurance  And I'll tell you your not wrong at those times  why because life happens and you get angry or you do something stupid  it isn't your fault  You might not get the chance to explain to everyone why you did it or people look with displeasure  It isn't your fault because deep down you know you are a good person and can do  you just happen to mess up at that moment  Once again IT ISN"T YOUR FAULT  It just happens  And you can fix it and maybe not every time   Being left out in the group  You act over enthusiastic because it is hard to connect with them  This is your only way to interact with them  You end up looking shallow and you keep doing this so you don't show you are hurt  So you try being serious and more intimate but only to find it is hard and only to come out as weird  Being social is hard  there are more acquaintances than friends and we use the word friends so shallowly these days  But you have to keep trying   You know something else that is hard and hurts  its when you say something by accident to a friend and it might be your fault or theirs but it doesn't matter  You know why  Because deep down you need them  The best thing you can do is to apologize regardless of who is wrong  You might feel vulnerable  Very very vulnerable at that time but the truth is you look very strong because you allow yourself in that position of vulnerability  Whether they continue to be your friend or not  you'll see who they really are  It is good he is out of your life  Perhaps he was tolerating you politely but finally reach his limit   Are you weak  NO  You have experience most people who live so happily but never had a hard life  You experience your humanity  the fight between right and wrong with yourself and caring about other people maybe not in the right what like what they think of you  but you know what it feels to hurt  What it feels to be lonely  The truth it is you are stronger than ever   It doesn't matter if other people had it worse  you understand one thing we all share  Pain   There is just one problem  You've been hurting for so long but just this one moment where you get betrayed it hurts  So what can you do  I know you still have good days left  The good days where you wake up and you feel like your can do it  Or atleast you wake up feeling amazing even as life hits you later in the evening  Look this is where you can dig yourself out and go make friends  new friends  This is the hardest part and there is no way around it  Not being lonely but building yourself back and throwing out more tears because this is the time where you fail alot and it will hurt EVEN MORE  But you have to do it  It will take time  days  weeks  or month  Just keep fighting  Keep fighting to good fight  There is no way around this but go out and have fun and make friends  how  Find out how  Not everyone will understand so you have to make them understand   That was me last night  I'm home from college with my family who doesn't really like to do very much  in a town where there isn't much to do  I was checking my snapchat Facebook twitter and seeing all my friends having fun with their friends and families and I hated myself for not having the guts to ask any of my friends from high school to do anything  and feeling afraid these friends I do have from school are gonna be shitty to me this year  I barely was able to fall asleep and when I woke up the multiple times in the middle of the night it was more of the same  I ended up staying in bed until around 11  but woke up  managed to get a shower  ate some pork  and went and watched the needlessly hectic Steelers game and managed to suppress some of the invasive thoughts  They're still there a bit  but I have to look forward   Always try to believe in better future  I'm kind of young to say this but you are getting stronger when you become older  I have been depresses like ten years now  and it's worse than ever right now  but I still think i'm sirviveing cause i'm gettin older and stronger and I still can build my future better  First of all  if you have not told anyone about your feelings do it now  It really helps  Try to get help to your problems cause like that you can get hope and power to win your battle  Don't waste your life  you are important  That's what  u Pizzachu1 does best  mock the pain of everyone around him but whine when someone gives him a taste of his own medicine  I'm not sure on your religious beliefs and honestly it doesn't matter but many people would take that sense of "what does it take to kill me" as a sign that you aren't meant to die yet   I like to think were all intricate cogs of this thing we call life  everybody has a part to play  no matter how small  and none of us can leave before were supposed too OP have you watched Taxi Driver  that movie made me realize there was no need to fret over my loneliness  I try to watch films that won't put me in that morbid mood  Somehow I get peace from The Big Lebowski or Workaholics  like atleast i'm not as big of a screwup as those characters  I also avoid watching things on tv with ads  if you have on demand use it  It will shelter you from the bullshit that media puts on you  Life is not how it is in commercials and its easy to fall in that mindset Books are good too and can calm anxiety if you have trouble sleeping  Read something your interested in  i browse cook books at night and read things like Homicide by David Simon cause I loved the show The Wire  Or read about sports or whatever fills that void  I hope things get better for you  That stripper sounds like a cunt  I don't blame you for your actions  but it's a shame the consequences will be severe  Best of luck to you   Do not get the hubbub about kids  my sister had one a year ago and her  her partner and the kid are all back here living at home in the family home from abroad with me and our parents for several months and it seems everyone but me believes it the greatest thing to happen in eons and above all else in considerations so obviously i'm the mean nasty one  Congratulations on taking this step  I'm sure you won't regret it and I hope it helps you be happier     You don't know me  I get so close to pulling myself out of whatever the hell hole I'm in and something just knocks me back to the bottom   I haven't seen it but I will check it out  it does look interesting  Thank you op you are amazing    I also saw your post replying to everyone and I think you need to listen to your own advice cause it's good and you have it in you     message anytime     It's the only medication that has effectively treated my depression  It's not perfect  of course  but it has made a big difference   I had some minor side effects when I started it  but they all wore off over time  It's great to have an antidepressant that doesn't kill my sex drive or make me tired   I've been on antianxiety medication the entire time I've been on lamictal  so I can't judge for sure whether it does anything to help with my anxiety on its own  However  I'd guess that it's not doing anything for that    I'm taking 300 mg of extended release once a day  if that helps  Bro 77kg at 1 80 isn't overweight  That sounds fairly normal to me  depending on your age  You're probably not nearly as fat and ugly as you think  You live your life for yourself  Don't plan it around someone else's but focus on your own life and find what it is that you want Not the way the majority of people would expect  It helps you  cope  with the feelings and not do anything risky  I'm on my second month on Prozac and I'm still depressed  but can still somewhat function  As of before  I couldn't even get out of bed   and I still do have those days      It's honestly up to you if it's worth it  I mean  they're designed to help with your depression so I don't see why not   that sounds shitty bro  blast some music on and chillax  give urself a break for a day or two  i hope so too I believe in you  I know it's rough that this keeps happening  But eventually  you're going to try and succeed and feel great about that  Stay strong  No  he is looking for people who have successfully gotten out from depression  But this sub is just a whole sub of sad people with very few people who give insightful response  Oh ok  I understand the hating your actual school  I can totally see how that would be frustrating  I don't know a whole lot about philosophy  but I do know how hard it can be to get into a good PhD program  I've always loved science  but excelled much more in the language arts type subjects  So the lack of ability is something I have struggled with in my areas of interest  as well  One thing I've thought about in the past is something Entreprenuer ish  but these days even that requires a business degree  If only the world still ran on apprenticeships   they're able to be found  it just isn't easy  Good luck on your endeavors  though  bro i deleted FB 4yrs ago  never been back once Have fun  Talking to people  r Needafriend  r INeedToTalkToSomeone  r KindVoice  Hiking  Walking out at night  skydiving  anime  music piano guitar etc  epic orchestra music  working hard and just simply being satisfied with working hard  join the military  excercise  swim  fap  video games Idk guess I was just looking for an easy fix  No such luck in this world I guess ah Okay  I understand  Are you able to talk with those people about what you're going through  It helped me alot and also reddit has replace Facebook in a positive way  OK  Why not   i wish i had your courage  dealing with this since july 2016    alone What was the text to help you with social anxiety if you don't mind  We are very similar it's weird I'm at a loss of words  What happened to us is completely different but fundamentally we face practically the same issues  I can't relate on not having hope  There must always be hope even a small amount and I think you do have the will to get better  I don't think you would have reached out and wrote your experience if not  We all just want to feel a connection   You may be interested in the philosophy of absurdism  It's essentially that we has humans have this inherent drive to find meaning in life and put values towards things  But we as humans can't find those answers   You can't grasp that you wasted you're life because it never happened  Nothing that we do in this life is a waste  I won't be able to forgive myself  or ever truly accept the past  i know I'll still have breakdowns and it's going to be a struggle to climb back up out of this hole but the thing is  That is okay  Learn from your past to not continue doing the same bad habbits  No one says you need to accept your wrongs but you do need to know them to not do them   I heard "heros don't become by doing big things but by doing what's right " Idk where  But we all have to strive to be our own heros and do what's right   Thank you for responding I'll try to take on my own advice for you and work on my self sabotaging behavior  I don't know about LinkedIn  It's like Facebook in that it is a tool for people to promote the best version of themselves which is not good for you if you have a tendency to compare yourself with others    I say avoid social media all together  Deactivate your profiles if you have to  They have been more or less dicks to me all my life  comparing how they treat others  But the last few months have been especially pain  This day was broke the camel's back  I went to Navy boot camp  gave up and came home because I was told I might have depression and then a doctor said I had it and social anxiety  I also felt I wasn't entitled to call my depressed  I couldn't even get pass boot camp and see war  my dad even said I was looking for attention  and how do you meet new people and make new friends  because facebook is the only way i can find out people Find some new hobbies or fun things to do  even if they're super simple  Maybe this will help you be happier    Stay strong  I believe in you  My sexual addiction is killing me  Its one fucking day into the new years and i have fucked two random people   Slut   Currently job hunting  hoping having a job will help out  That job search depression is really kicking in though unfortunately   Um   okay    Hmm thanks for the tip   I started a couple shows and series but always got bored after a couple episodes   But I will give the shows you recommended a try should I find them online    Feel you there  I was happy and with friends last night and thought maybe I would get a momentary break in the depression  but it came back with a vengeance this afternoon and i've been in a slump ever since   Thank you for sharing  I would be very frustrated if I were in your shoes  I understand caring and being supportive  but acting like nothing is wrong  or not even acknowledging issues pisses me off    Personally I don't like being called "uncle " It makes me feel like the only reason I'm acknowledged is because of my blood relationship  I want my family to know and accept me for who I am and not because of a hereditary relationship  Don't get too let down  job rejection happens to the best of us  what   You'll find some relief by forgetting what's happened in the past  becoming unattached to things you cant control  and just trying to maintain your attention on the present moment  It sounds like a lot of your pain and anger are coming from outside forces you can't control  Just let go and be present  There's very little happening to you RIGHT NOW that is causing you any harm  There is a lot of relief to be found in this fact  Just my thoughts  Can you tell me why you want to die  In the same boat  but I only had 1 friend   and I lost him  Fuck  Feel free to Pm me if you just need someone to talk too    I slept through New Years eve for the first time last night  went to sleep at 10 45 and my family couldn't believe it  I think we ought to stop being so reckless and want death so badly  because    I feel for a lot of problems people have  there is a way to mend it  and if there isn't  you can at least try to find it with all your might  How do you feel about explaining to her how you're feeling  Depression is not something you choose  All of our behavior can be traced to physical biological and environmental phenomena  You certainly didn't choose these things  Don't feel ashamed for the way you feel  That just makes the problem worse  yep  well i might be emotionally immature stunted so verbal interactions does not do much for me as physical interactions  BUT if someone doesn't want to talk to me I would definitely feel they might not like me and then I become sad  Like if someone hugged me for an hour and didn't say anything I would feel very good  if someone spent an hour talking to me I would feel okay to good  but if someone spent an hour ignoring me I would feel really bad  Also with talking you can kind of do that at any time with anyone  Have a chat with the cashier or the mailman  Or post something on reddit or youtube  For physical things  you can't just run up to someone and hug them or hold their hand  Going through the same exact thing right now  I'm so sorry you're dealing with this too  That's an interesting take on it  I do remember being kind of excited to finally figure out who wins the afterlife debate  but I guess I have to wait a little longer This is a tough thing to go through  especially alone  do you have anybody supporting you  I wish I would just die  I hate myself  Nothing matters  I'm pathetic  And disgusting  Perfect metaphor   I agree with you  The tricky part is that in a way these social media  IG  FB  whatever  is MADE to make the person look better   be it the filter  angles  caption  blah blah blah   It's hard when you really are going through things and you're bombarded with people's pictures about their birthdays  parties  celebration of some sort  work success and gifts   because they WANT  you to go "OMG yaaaaay you "  I have no problem congratulating someone and being happy for someone genuinely   Don't line the shit up strategically  at an angle  with some stupid hashtag   blessed or  besthusband or something like that  and expect ALL of us to fawn over that  you know  There's a difference between someone finishing a masters degree and someone humble bragging over a bouquet of flowers or a bracelet  from their BF    How's your relationship with your family  Could you stay with them  Can you tell me what's making your run so hard  darling  I love the rhythm  Excellent work  One of the nice things about memes is that they usually get screenshot and reposted to pretty much every website ever   I'm glad the change so far has had a good effect  I deleted my FB a while back and it's honestly alleviated my stress levels so much  It took a few months for Zoloft to work for me  Then I felt wonderful but now I feel like shit again     So I'm planning on talking to my psychiatrist about switching   Honestly  I think it would help to be in a sunnier place   Not saying it would cure depression  but even just being able to spend more time outside would make me at least feel a bit better  Me too  Just please promise me to not make a plan  That's what I promise myself all the time  If I do make a plan  then I might as well consider myself dead then and there  Man I'm so glad I found them  thanks to you  In so much that I appear fine and normal since the pills are "fixing" me  Otherwise it isn't spoken about  Thanks for asking  Stay strong friend and pray this all makes sense to us someday  I don't identify with any religion but I have to believe in a god or I couldn't cope   I feel the same way  Especially last night  Just take all my meds and have it over  I can't though  I love my family too much and don't want to destroy their lives  I feel alone  Nothing good is happening  I have no job  Guy i was seeing for over two months is gone  Just feel alone   I feel like this too  On the surface  my life looks great  Even my therapist says I'm making great progress but I don't agree and I feel like I'm stuck in a hole that I have no idea how to climb out of  Okay  how do you feel about that  I don't always want to   I'm an intelligent  above average  certainly   creative  curious individual  and I honestly have a lot of things going for me in that sense   But I can't motivate myself   I struggle to see any purpose to my life  the point  etc  etc    However  it's not all the time   When I'm not depressed  I feel very positive and enthusiatic   I have lofty goals   It comes and goes   The depressive episodes are actually "better"  but   the good times are becoming more muted   I feel defeated even then   I enjoy things I used to less   Even my curiosity dims   My talents and abilities are wasting away   I've fought for years  Since I was a kid  even before my teen years   I've swung back so many times  but I am slowly losing the battle   Every episode erodes me more and more    I am like a boulder on a jetty   I have been strong  but the ebb and flow of the sea is relentless   Eventually the water will reduce me to but a caricature of what I once was  my potential  a husk of myself   I intend to wait about 5 years  and if my trajectory still aims for this outcome  stop it by any means necessary   The pain  the lack of anything worthwhile   The cons outweigh the pros   Perhaps I'll go on a spiritual pilgramage or something  try to find an alternate mode of living   Perhaps I'll already have explored that path sufficiently by then   If that fails  there's not much left  That doesn't help OP  I appreciate the words of encouragement  I think in writing a book  I left a little to be desired  It's nice to see that I got a response  I do want away from here  but even that's tough  I hope 2017 holds meaning for me  I need to move forward   Also trying to get a CDL and pesticide applicator's license  I feel so behind still yet  I need this to be a year in which I move forward  Tired  Numb  but Raw I was at a small party with friends  It was a good time  But not one Happy New Year text  It's strange  I got a Happy Thanksgiving from a friend and a few Merry Christmas texts  but nothing for the New Year   Makes me wonder if Facebook is further drawing people away from being connected to one another Okay  How do you feel about therapy  This is just normie spewing garbage  This shit doesn't fix years of trauma and mental illness  I'm never going to marry and have kids  This I know for fact  My depression doesn't let me get close to any woman  It doesn't matter how buff I get  what degree I achieve  or how much money I make  I will never feel normal or achieve that same amount of normacy as others  And I will suffer for years because of it  I believe our age demographic needs its own subreddit  because in GFD I often feel surrounded by high schoolers   Depression is a different beast when you still have it at 35  as I do  I'm also sick and possibly dying with an antibiotic resistant infection of the colon  I am alone  not stuck around family  and many things in life are behind me  not in front of me  I have lost my wife   I do not care about AAA releases  When you've gamed for as long as we have  you've pretty much seen it all before and  big shock for you young people  it's all been done better   Most gaming I do now is with my one close friend  and it's usually pool and golf  sometimes a racing game  I used to be a Quake clan player when I was in high school   I had an experience last year playing "Hockey Question Mark"  an obscure first person hockey game  on a team in a league  I'd always wanted to play hockey growing up  but it wasn't possible   I was the oldest person on my team by 15 years  Grandpa Clone  they called me  I still enjoyed my team mates but  not surprisingly  got along with the oldest among them  at 24  the best  He was my defensive partner  so that was nice  All the others were under 18   It was fun  but their immaturity was evident  and frustrating at times   pushing the league rules  getting us in trouble with the league management  for fun instead of focusing on our strategies and our skills  When they were doing this B S  and I asked them how old they were  They were offended   no one older than 24 is offended by a question about age    "Why should that matter  "  Read this post  and you will know why it matters   Edit  And now  to emphasize even more  I reached out to a member here who said he "knew exactly where I was coming from" in a post about my age and how I feel this might not be the right place for me  I invited him to possibly play with my friend and I  After looking at his post history though  I was quite disturbed  "FUCK OFF FAGGOT " and "STFU " all over the place  I sent him a message telling him I'd seen this  and asking him his age and why he thinks he's mature  what makes him believe he is  He exploded at me  exclaiming that I had autism  the friend I was inviting him to play games with HAS autism  WOW  No compassion  What a toxic bunch teenagers can be  What a toxic cess pool  Sorry kids  I feel like I've washed up on the beach at some kind of Chuck E  Cheese's version of "Lord of the Flies"   The deleted post in reply to this one was nearly as toxic as my interactions with this member  Thank you mods   If anyone thinks the experience of depression isn't dramatically different when you're a teenager compared to when you're an adult  I would hazard to guess that you have yet to experience the latter  If you had  you would know  The pressures are different and the sadnesses are different  It takes the brain until 24 or 25 to finish development  and it takes the heart even longer   If any older gamers with depression see this message and want to connect with me privately  please PM me   Goodbye GFD  and good luck in the new year to everyone  Not good  we rarely talk  How come  Wow mate calm down  some people clearly found it useful no need to be a dick  I didn't say this will fix all your problems did I  You clearly have issues just like everyone else on this thread  hence forth it being depression  So instead of being a cunt why not speak to people and ask for help     BUT if someone doesn't want to talk to me I would definitely feel they might not like me and then I become sad   You remind me of my grandma  She think i don't like her or don't want to have a conversation with her  To put it up to 11  i could phrase it as "People think i don't want to talk with them because i hate them  but in truth i don't want to talk with them because i hate myself"    Also with talking you can kind of do that at any time with anyone  Have a chat with the cashier or the mailman   Nah  that's different  I was fully opened with only one person in my life  now it's less than that  I've done it many times  This last time was for about 2 3 years  I felt i overstayed  hit their limit to what they could do to help  I liked them but they have moved further away and I don't have the amount of money needed    I feel pathetic that I have to pay someone to listen to me    I don't mean any offense  Okay  How's your support system  Okay  I understand  Did therapy help you  Most people here do speak to people and ask for help   Asking for and getting help do not "cure"  anything though    Yeah  these holidays are bad for depression  Many of us are single and when we see everyone together for the holidays  it reminds us of how lonely we are  And I'm so glad 'The Holidays' are over  but then remembered that Valentines day is a month and a half away  FUCK  I was friend zoned about a month ago now  Valentine's day is gonna be such a bitter and horrible thing  especially this year  I've explained to her how stressful the past few months have been and she always apologizes to me  I don't want her to feel like a burden  but sometimes I think she does  And then I feel bad even complaining because I know how difficult it's been for me  so I can't even imagine how hard it's been for her    At first  but then  like all things  they lose their power or something  I have no job or social life atm so that makes it worse than it probably would be  and also means all the ongoing "issues" are mine despite everyone here being some calibre of f up or another or we wouldn't all be living here  parents are divorced  sister partner don't have alot of money etc   I get the uncle crap too  someone holds her and gets her to point at me and call me uncle  made my feelings clear about that which has made me the ahole of course  Have kids all you want  just don't expect others or the world to deem it as important or amazing as you do  Hello  I saw your post in  r stackadvice  You might be get a better response here   You claim that you have depression and want it gone  You also state that you want whatever you might try to be rapid acting  However  your request is too broad  for me  at least  to attempt to address  and it's not clear what information will be relevant and what won't  So if you don't mind answering  here are some questions which may be useful   Are you a  mostly  healthy person  Legally an adult   How long have you been experiencing depressive symptoms   Would you characterize your depression as something you're "in "  Do you have a history of difficulties with mood  depressive or otherwise   What are the main symptoms of your current depression  Please be as detailed as you're comfortable   Are there any major stressors in your life at the moment  e g  school  work  family  relationships  social life  haunted mansions  etc     What have you tried so far to treat your symptoms   Do you have access to a psychiatrist or someone with a medical degree   Have to ever been to psychotherapy  For video games as well  I used to love them  Now I use them as a distraction  Well mate I'm sorry for offending you but this is just the truth and my  our reality  Talking and affirmations doesn't fix this shit  This is painfully accurate It's the way you interpret the statement  I agree it isn't just to easy to breeze over things  I've been in a very shit place over the past few years and I attempted suicide 3 weeks ago and now I'm an outpatient  But the more I'm speaking to people and realising new things  It's not meant to be a massive statement that will solve everything  It's there as just a bit of inspiration  a lot of people with depression dwell on things that cannot be changed  Yeah it isn't easy but the more I'm speaking to people in here I'm starting to realise more and more  Rather than being dicks speak to people about your problems  For the past 4 weeks I spoken to 2 people  I open a Reddit account and I've met so many people it's unreal  I've actually seen a bit of a light  Then my friend sent me that and I thought fuck it  it is a bit of inspiration and it does help  I never meant it to be condescending or make out it's easy  but see the bigger picture in life  Yeah life is shit but it's what you make of this shit hole  Films are one of my only ways to escape and feel good about myself    But on the other hand I have this fantasy life in my head where I'm an actress  I keep googling upcoming films and choose which films I'd be starring in  try to have an idea of what I'd wear on red carpet  what photoshoots I'd do  the places I'd got to visit  events and parties I'd go  all this amazing and interesting life that's never going to happen   I feel pathetic just writing this down  and makes me want to give up even trying to get a mediocre  content life  This is exactly what I'm fearful of  I'm really poor right now and can't afford much  so if I'm going to turn out the way I came in   then no therapy for me  That's how I feel  that somehow real life is not for me  it's something that people around me do that I'm unable to  and that having no social life or goals like me is normal   Because of things that happened when I was younger  Didn't tell them till a few years ago and no one believe me so we don't really talk anymore I don't get offended  nothing anyone really says bothers me  but the fact you need to be a dick just isn't necessary  If you read I said it may change party how you feel think   People are depressed for all different reasons  so because it meant fuck all to you doesn't make that the fact for everyone   Same here  it's like Lady of Shalott  someone on reddit actually told me about it a couple of years ago when I was describing this feeling  and in a coincidence I had a painting of it on my fb page  haven't changed it since because I resonate so much with it  I have no plan  the expectation are too high for me  I just want to live my life  sometimes I just want to end it but I know if I did that someone that I know will never forgive me I have told one friend and can't afford a therapist   At least not yet  I'm really sorry  There's nothing much you can do because they're adults  You can guide them in the right direction and give suggestions  but it's up to them to follow through  But please  please don't force them to do anything  Just accept whatever they say  That's where you're wrong  asking for and then getting help is the only way anything can change  I've sat staring at the same 4 walls for weeks then tried to commit suicide  Been on meds all that shit  but they aren't the answer because my issues are underlining I have shit view of the world and everything in  But since I've started speaking to people in Reddit and speaking to old friends  I'm learning more and more about people and they're showing me different way of looking at things    Everyone's got their own reason for depression  because ours isn't the same doesn't mean it doesn't help someone else  Anything else I should look for   Fine print stuff  company to use  etc   I take Lexapro for anxiety and depression  I love this medication  but I do also have to deal with sexual side effects which are annoying  I also had to go through two other medications before I was prescribed Lexapro  Anti depressants work  but also need to be prescribed alongside taking therapy  The medication helps your mind  while the therapy helps you deal with whatever triggers the depression anxiety  Bullshit you got butthurt because I didn't agree with you and go "YEAHH THIS HELPED ME" lurk more  It has been over a year now  I am not sure I would get back together with him unless he felt he was ready to be in a relationship  I would consider it but only if we had a long talk about what that means and if we could reach a mutual decision that works both of us  I do know that I will always love him though  He is an extraordinary man but he does not see what I see though    I have a similar problem  thinking no one really gives a damn  I do a couple of things  first of all I remind myself that people don't really hang out with others unless they want to and second that I maybe asking too much of people   People will only do so much  i wish it were different but that's what I found  Have you seen a dr  A hormonal imbalance  vitamin deficiency  family history can all cause depression without an obvious reason   Deleted mine in 2011 never used it much and never had many "friends" on it had it out of sheep mentality  you did the right thing  Wow fuck me  keep going mate  This is rather funny  you don't know me  I honestly don't give a shit what anyone says I don't know you and your opinion is invalid  You're the one that's come here to vent your anger  pretty sure it's you that's 'butthurt'  I've haven't interacted on the internet for that long I forgot keyboard warriors like you still existed  Haha wow have a nice pal   I honestly feel the exact same way  The med dosage I take helps with the pain and anxiety  but the loneliness and self loathing are ever present  Yep  I use them more of a crutch than enjoyment  I got new games for Christmas but I can't even motivate myself to play them  Sad    Clickbait  Cute though   I have learned this myself  Keep the suicide comments to a minimum so they don't take overt actions   It's about biding time  keeping every ball bouncing the same until things are in more control  gr8 b8 I r8 8 8 m8 I agree with your logic shouldve deleted mine sooner aye     agree 100  yup memes are everywhere lmao  its only been a day since i deleted fb and it already feels like a huge weight was lifted of my shoulders   I just bought Doom and some cases in Rocket League and CS GO  just to blow all my money away  I thought they would produce some happiness  but all it gave was nothing  I quit Doom the moment I bought it  and I quit Rocket League after the first couple games  It is sad    No I haven't seen one  Im planning but I'm scared for my career   Im turning 25 in a few days and I haven't accomplished that much in my life  The career that I have right now is the only thing that I have by default happy new years i aint that desperate yet     lol Funnily enough  Kingdom Hearts was the game I was talking about lol  And I am currently on season 2 of the Flash   I've been taking Zoloft for nearly 10 months   Haven't really noticed much other than I've grown more apathetic and 'lazy' than I have been in the past    I'm so proud of you  good job  That's honestly such a hard thing to do  I hope you feel better soon  If I ever have to talk to a doctor teacher or friend I never say I'm depressed  I just say I want to die or I just hate living  If you do have someone  please talk to them about your problems  If you do and it seems like they aren't trying to help  they may just be struggling to understand you  I know years ago when I was dating who I thought of as my "true love"  she would often go into a quiet and depressive state without warning  She was definitely also bipolar  from what I had observed  and had issues with anger  I tried so desperately to understand her and help  and she made me feel like I did nothing somehow  She would shrug me off and say nothing was wrong  I wanted to badly to help  but she pushed me away  probably because I was struggling with terrible anxiety and she was afraid of what might happen to us in the future  We've been separated for at least 3 or 4 years  and I have yet to feel as passionately about anyone as I did for her for many long years  If someone really cares they should always do what they can to help  but it's up to you to reconcile and tell them how they can do so   Sorry if this is useless  I try to be helpful but often feel slightly  if not completely  useless  If none of that struck any importance  please at least still know that there are people in this world who will absolutely and genuinely care about you  and that there are people here on this sub reddit who will always be open to talk   Hopefully things get better for all of us some day  All the time     Honestly I try really hard not to think about it  I did some crazy and fucked up things while manic that I'm still ashamed of  I hope that someday I can forgive myself but I'm not there yet    The only thing to do is move forward and do whatever I can to keep it from happening again  What are you interested in   I enjoy The Mindy Project  because all of her relationships fail BUT she is always okay  It set much more realistic expectation for myself  Also it's hilarious  Someone else mentioned Workaholics  also a good one  As someone with social anxiety like a mother fucker I can't stand the movies with the "awkward" cute girls having someone fall madly in love with them because I'm awkward as shit and that is not an accurate portrayal of how it pans out   At least in my life   You're not required to love family    Perhaps you could use a new start  Maybe move away and develop new relationships  That's what I'm going to do   It's actually one of the main causes of depression  one of the best things i've ever done in my life was to delete my Instagram account exactly a year ago   It's capitalism and how greedy people from a Western culture are I guess  We buy countless stuff to feel happy but it doesn't last long at all  Maybe I'm just a miserable bastard but that's how I view it  Even if I had a girlfriend I don't think it would change anything  All I really want to do is sleep  Like forever  Not much  I play the guitar a little bit but I suck at it  and I don't think that'll change soon  That's certainly understandable  It is unfortunate that in some careers people are unable to seek help for fear of losing their job    You could speak with a GP about some of your physical symptoms  Some drugs used to treat depression are also used for other things like weight loss  smoking cessation etc  I was struggling with depression and have severe vitamin D deficiency  Whenever it gets low  I'm unable to function and go into a spiral  Maybe getting a health check could help    Is there something specific driving your feelings   I HATE that this happens Just got accused of invalidating others' feelings by talking about my depression Really sliding into a bad place and I'm scared  could have used some help  instead I got that shit  I HATE that people don't even try to understand  ask question or at least educate themselves  before they pass judgments   You can't blame them for some things  but for ending friendships due to it  hell yeah you can blame  Sides i cant love friends eitehr all they ever do is cross me   I've been on Effexor I think  I have a friend on Vyvanse now  Isn't it an amphetamine  I have heart problems so I don't think I'd be able to take it  Plus I don't want something that will give me terrible withdrawals if I stop taking it  I'll research the other two  Thanks     I always thought 'if I get depressed  I'll always keep running and it'll keep me from the lowest lows'  Turns out clinical depression's a little different from that in that you don't want to  have zero interest in  physically  can't  run  even if you used to be a marathoner  So yeah  I relate to this  I've tried to get myself out there but it's 100000000000 times harder  even though I'm not out of shape  and I end up quitting  When you are depressed  Your brain functions differently  Different chemical reactions going on in your head  You aren't doing anything on purpose  The symptoms are there  That's like saying you are adding on to your cold by sneezing too much  Try taking vitamin D and getting a gym member ship  Get on a routine and then find a social activity  Like volunteering or some school program  Getting on a strike food and workout routine is crucial to getting over it  You are sick and there is a cure  It's hard and I too suffer from it  I went into the hospital last month because i wasn't eating  Your body will fix itself   There is no sucking at guitar if you enjoy doing it  cheesy as that sounds  Well  there are some really common symptoms of depression to check for  For example  have you been sleeping okay  have you had changes in appetite  do you find it more difficult than usual to get out of bed  do you feel 'slowed down' or get aches and pains'  do you feel worse about yourself than usual  do you feel hopeless  or as if nothing will get better  is your focus concentration poorer than usual   If you have a number of these symptoms  it is likely you are experiencing depression  but I cannot diagnose you of course  and whether it is situational or endogenous we cannot tell you either Hey  just wanted to say  I've read your words  And I'm sorry for your loss    I'm not one for long complex comments  But what you said about that ride  If it's one thing I've learnt in the past 5 years of depression is if they're important to you and they care about you  don't beat yourself up over what you said when you're feeling depressed  if they care they'll understand and they'll stay  Hell I've called friends the worst names under the sun  the ones  a small few  who care stay It's okay if you don't feel like it  no need to force yourself to do anything  But believe me  you need some fun in your life  It will not make any problem disappear  but it'll make them easier to bear  You're going through a tough time right now  Being sad is normal  you shouldn't shy away from it  Sadness will handicap your daily life without any doubts  It will affect everything from your career to your eating habits  It is how you cope with it that will tell you if you are depressed or not  It may take years for you to find true happiness again but it will come eventually  Whether it comes internally or externally at some point you will find some sort of happiness  It doesn't necessarily get easier or better with time but you eventually fond ways to go around sadness to seek happiness  And it is those brief happiness moments that will make up for all the time you've been sad   I don't even know  first of all I would like to thank you for the time u took to respond back to me  I feel the feeling that I have stems from the fact that I haven't found what is my call in life  It is so frustrating since I'm getting older and time is not on my side  Not only that I also think that I'm asexual  no sex drive at all   There really is tho  It's rough playing the same thing 300 times and realizing the one thing you actually care about is something you're so bad at  Something that you just can't train your fingers to do  How pathetic is that  Go places  Join clubs  Join a gym and attend fitness classes  Make friend with your colleagues  We both know there is no secret to making friends  You have to go places   I deleted Facebook a while ago but was surprised to find out it's never actually permanently deleted  If you log in it will restart  How can you permanently delete it  I deleted Facebook a while ago but was surprised to find out it's never actually permanently deleted  If you log in it will restart  How can you permanently delete it  At some point you have to just embrace the nervousness and do it anyway  I've literally vomitted having to go somewhere new but the more you force yourself the easier it gets    If you are truly seriously deeply unable to do this  not just uncomfortable  not just a horrible terrible feeling  but would lay down and die if someone had a gun to your head      then you need to get medical help  It's okay if that's the case  you don't have to be ashamed    But you need to do one or the other    start forcing yourself through babysteps or get medical help  Either way it'll start to get better  Feel for ya  pal   Well  I'm thinking of cutting my thighs again  opposed to killing myself  Nothing is really bothering me but my illness  also insomnia  Took a Trazadone and am waiting for that to work  Overall  I'm feeling empty  "Dude  sucking at something is just the first step at being sorta good at somthing"   Jake The Dog  Adventure time  Season 1 episode   His Hero I haven't had any side effects with lamictal  but it's always a possibility that is a good point I think I am just desperate at this point that I am willing to do anything to engage in basic human interactions I do wanna be accepted by people but people usually don't want to associate with the real me  Maybe this is the wrong direction to take this but if you want support for this particularly   You might want to check anti natalism subs for more logical and less negative reason to have your own   It has actually made me want to adopt someday rather than continue the overpopulation  I hope you're in a better place   I'm struggling too right now and while it hurts to think of others sad lonely depressed it helps me to know I'm not alone   Sorry to hear that   Are there any adults at school that you are comfortable talking to about some of this   Make sure you get tested frequently  stay safe buddy     I took it for a while when it first came out and I hated it  After about a month of taking it I would start having a ridiculously fast heartbeat whenever I took it  It felt like my heart was literally going to burst and I got cold sweats  I went to the doctor because of the symptoms and they told me I needed to get off it right away because my blood pressure and pulse were through the roof  So yeah  I don't take that anymore   Second this but without the friend zoned part  add fearing never meeting someone to connect to      Dude if someone said that to me I'd be blown away   I might want to date them just for being real   What do you like to watch on YouTube   It's as legitimate as Netflix and you can learn from it    and never really "finish" your binge Sorry you don't feel like you have anyone to talk to   Feel free to message me if you would like someone to talk to  I would be happy to help    I use my laptop and Xbox as an escape from it  My parents try to persuade me to take up more social activities but I'm just not the social type of person In germany  the psychiatrist can only send you to a closed ward if you are in acute danger to yourself or others  So if you dont have any  plans as to how when you want to kill yourself  she cant send you anywhere  So my advice would be that you tell her  you go to her because you want  and need  help but she couldnt really help you nearly as well if you hold back   I took medication for a while but the problem for me was that you have to take most of them for at least a month before they really show anything and usually in that first month it gets worse before it gets better  And then you dont have a guarantee that this medication will work so you may well try four or five different types  thats more than half a year in which I was more miserable than before so at some point I told myself I can do it without medication    Before my first appointment  I was nervous as hell  wondering what I would tell him and how I would go about it  Turned out that all wasnt necessary since its most of the time the psychiatrist thats leading the conversation  he she is asking questions and you just tell the truth  or if you dont want  tell that you arent comfortable talking about it  she has to accept that and maybe come back to it in a later session  Why should we distract ourSelves  It's an escape not a cure like you said  It's fine if you want the temporary distraction but I don't  Social media is poison if you are depressed   I deleted my Insta account  I have reduced my Facebook time to almost zero  keeping it because of a hobby I have that connects through FB  And I have a LinkedIn account  Nothing else   Stay away from as much social media AS possible   Even if I want to go somewhere I can't  I can't drive  and I'm stuck babysitting most days  I thought the point of living with your parents was that you don't pay rent   Maybe you should move out and get a roommate     One of my lesser hobbies is finding good deals   Check out fatwallet com or slickdeals net   Some people make a living finding deals and flipping it on ebay   When I was poor  I was able to live on  50 a month for food   I used to take the bus and walk to the grocery store because I couldn't afford a car   I was able to pay my 35k student loan in 2 years living frugal  Sorry to hear it is a problem   It sounds like he is very supportive of you which is great to hear and want you want in a significant other   You explain you have this uncomfortability with yourself  but have you communicated this to him   Have you told him you think he is "wonderfully supportive" and ask him that you need his support   May I suggest something active when these waves hit  going fora walk together can help with the endorphins  Hey u nekroid  I feel you  Depression on its own sucks without having to deal with anxiety bipolarity and BPD  although I lean further toward MPD DID   so I can relate to you a bit    I'm writing this at 4am my time  because I spent the last two hours trying to pick myself out of the rut of depression in order to try to sleep   Suicidal thoughts suck  but for every one that drags us down it's a symbol of determination that we persist each day    I know it sounds like I'm being perky and cheery  I just have a habit of coming across like that when I type  either that or pissed off     Turn to your boyfriend for the good and if you feel like it's a bad day  you are welcome come talk  One or both of me will be around   Might I recommend Mr  Suicide Sheep on YouTube  He's got a lot of good music for depression  it's mostly chilled out stuff I'm terminally single and it's never really bothered me until recently  So many people I know recently got engaged or are getting engaged soon and my friends are all coupled up  which means I'm left out a lot when they go do couple things     It's very hard and people are suddenly treating me like there's something wrong with me since I'm 27F and     STILL SINGLE OHNOEZ SO CLOSE TO 30  and contrary to popular belief  not every 20something female has the easiest time finding someone to date   I'm very introverted and don't connect to a lot of people which makes it hard finding someone I actually want to date   I'm sorry  but I just don't get it  What exactly do you want  Are you satisfied with your current lifestyle  If so  why are you posting in  r depression  I might not have all the answers  but I want to help  I totally feel you  8 minutes into 2017 and I already get left on read  My text was even a simple  inconsequential question that could have quickly been answered with a "yes" or a "no"  They just didn't bother to answer  for some reason  I can't help but feel that it means something more even though it most likely doesn't  Anyway  my point is  you're not alone and this situation definitely sucks   If you really want to pursue improving yourself in guitar  the most you can do is practice and thinking about mistakes is good for learning but don't go overboard  I can't stress enough how important it is to be passionate about something though   When someone tells you to knock off the pity party  I want you to smash that person in the face as hard as you can  Mine took about a month to work  first two weeks were hell and made me feel horrible  Just don't ever skip a dose  Zoloft withdrawals are the worst thing ever  It's so hard  Honestly I would say try to meet just one friend  from a club or something  The first friend is the hardest  After that  you can often hang out with that person's friends and it can have a trickle effect   This does sound like depression  It goes hand and hand with anxiety for many people  I'm usually hit hardest with anxiety but depression comes and goes for me  I would suggest trying a counselor  Sometimes just having a firm diagnosis and knowing what to call what is going on and having a term for it is helpful  Take it day by day  I deleted mine in 2015 and wanted to know who were my friends and acquaintances out of 250  people    The answer is None   I feel this  I don't enjoy waking up and look forward to the day anymore and haven't for over a year  I used to love playing video games and cleaning my room  but now all I do basically is sit down and do nothing but be bored on the internet  I have no motivation and no energy to do anything I love anymore  It's all hard and feels like a waste of time  Crying is more of a comfort to me now because sitting around feeling sick of myself is worse  My boyfriend just tells me to "stop feeling sad" and "get over it" and "you're holding yourself back" but I am frustrated that he doesn't understand that it's not that easy  I'm not lazy  and it doesn't help at all when he says crap like that  My doctor doesn't help me get the medications I need  and gave me ones that only made me worse with each change  My mom  dad  and brother don't act the same around me whenever I do go out of my boring  lonely apartment like they used to   But I'm glad to see this because it makes me feel less alone  I hope this is a comfort  Wow I never even thought of New Years texts  I got a Facebook message from my mom and that's it   Okay  Once you can afford it  how do you feel about trying it  It helps to know that you are not the only one the only reason I haven't deleted Facebook yet is for the memes like there's so many good meme pages that help me feel better when I'm sad  also My Spotify is connected through it so    but boy would I be better off without it  Comparing urself to others is so bad but I do it all the time  yea that's true  for me a comparison would be like hugging family vs hugging a partner  light and day difference  but hugging family and friends still feels pretty good though  Yes  Facebook is a pox  Zuckerberg invented a brand new way for people to be offended  The dreaded Unfriending      The Horror       Fuck that whole clusterfuck of a social spiderweb  Yeah  that kicking in part of the meds and trying different ones sucks  If I get any worse than I am right now  she might as well lock my ass up and lobotomize me    Do you know how when I get my diagnosis papers   I'm kinda treating that as a diploma of sorts  a diploma of how fucked I am lol I can relate   just this afternoon I'm walking on the beach with my dog  having ridden my bike there  and I feel depressed  I thought "someone else could have my life and they might be happy " well  that may be true  but such a thought makes me feel worse  it makes me feel ashamed  that I should somehow magically feel better  because someone else in my shoes might feel different  i feel as i do  and feeling depressed when i might normally feel happy is a symptom of depression  heck  i've been depressed at disneyland  the alleged happiest place on earth  among the hardest things about depression for me is to not completely identify with it  it can feel all consuming  like "I am depression "  lately i feel like there is a biochemical component to my depression  because mornings are hell  afternoons are hell lite  and then late afternoons and eves i can feel at ease and happy  but then the next morning it starts all over  god  its wearing though       I agree  That's why I'm apart of the YMCA and lift shoot hoops almost daily  The problem is I can't just go random ass places by myself  That's how I end up on the news dead   Check out these subs  r TwinCitiesTransplants r TwinCitiesSocial  Man this makes me cry because I feel the exact same way  I couldn't do that to my parents  but damn do I just want to go  24 7 Im so on edge that I could drop something and start crying  My mom was so happy about the "New Year" too telling me things would get better its a new start when she kept going I just wanted to cry my eyes out  Its just another year of misery Bout as pathetic as playing the same shit over and over again for a decade  Admiral is right  you gotta start somewhere  I'm not talented and one depressed S O B but fuck  you play that shit for a while you get a little better  Then you move to a new song you bore yourself to tears over it    Shit when I started I could barely play smoke on the fucking water  but bit by bit I improved  Hated myself for forcing myself to play  still do  but it's something I care about  So be that dumbass dipshit and play it again  because 2016 sucked  2017 may not even notice us leave   And when you're cursing over that song for the 1000th time call me that idiot loser who told you to play   Fuck it  we might even make a friend or two who likes guitar   Maybe then killing oneself might not seem like such a calling  because you  like me can play guitar and you'll be good at something   All cursing and swearing aside  I'm cool with teaching you a bit of guitar  bout the only thing I'm vaguely good at  2  5  7   2  5  9  6    Shit fucked it up again  smoke on the water   Hope you had a good new year also  I find that being lazy relaxes me  and I don't see it as a bad thing if it happens every once in a while  I use the time to recharge and relax  get away from my troubles and distract myself  For me  I know I'm feeling down when my feelings from my past arise  or if any issues from the present start to affect me more than usual   Does that makes sense   Basically  everything comes at me at once  and I get sadder than usual  and being by myself does me no good  During this time  I go seek out company  Even if I don't tell them what's going on  it helps to be around others and be distracted   When I'm okay  I can laugh and enjoy things normally  Reading and watching TV can easily distract me  and my sadness is kept at bay  That doesn't mean things aren't wrong  I still have underlying issues that I need to work through  and those feelings can come up at anytime  I try to keep busy to distract myself from those feelings until I work through them  Does that help  You should ask your doctor whether they would like to consider switching to other medications in the same class as abilify aripiprazole    a common one used to augment wellbutrin in depression would be seroquel quetiapine  After consultation with maternal fetal medicine before even getting pregnant  I made the choice to stay on my meds  including lithium  The doctor said he's had many patients stay on it and in his career he hasn't seen an issue  I had to have a fetal echocardiogram to make sure the heart was developing properly  and the fetal cardiologist told me the same thing  she's never seen an issue with lithium exposure in her career  It's rare but there is a reported risk  I now have a 100  happy  well not right now because teething  and healthy 6 month old  He was not a fussy newborn either   I wish I got cancer but of course I kept this opinion to myself because cancer is a sensitive issue to many people   I feel the same  Same thing happened to me today as well  Hit me like a ton of bricks   I miss not being depressed     I wish to be happy in 2017 and cure my depression  Omg that is my first thing I stop doing when the dark cloud cometh   I'm going through a really tough time right now and I'm going to go brush my teeth bc for some reason I thought this was just a "me thing" and I have been not doing this one small self care act lately  or washing my face before bed  or well   lots of little things  Wow  reading everyone's posts  I feel like I'm not alone here  sorry  newbie to Reddit    Thanks for the post    I'm sorry to hear that  message me if you'd like to talk    Hope things get better for you   I deeply relate to you  I don't feel good  Mentally and physically  It's one thing to always be mad or sad  but it shows more when you start losing hair and throwing up like every week   At least I can seek comfort in posts like yours  I don't feel so alone  Thanks  Ive had mine gone for a year and it feels relieving doesnt it  I like being on the low instead of on social media  Like all hidden  Facebook is for mindless people that sit around and judge those who don't live like them lol  23 y o  male here  kill me plz  I suppose but man  I feel like you have it or you don't  I just can't gety fingers to move that fast and independent of each other  It's just one of those things where you got it or you don't  and I don't  I'm so fucking bad at everything and I doubt that'll change   Every time I read articles of terminally ill patients receiving assisted suicide  I can't help but feel jealous   Not the guy you asked  but I find  r wholesomememes and  r absolutelynotme irl to be pretty interchangeable  so it doesn't bother me  Probably worth mentioning I don't really read the comments though  Can't think of one that I feel comfortable with  so really I just have to deal with it really  I feel so alone  And worthless  My life is falling apart and I'm losing the love of my life   I don't know if I can keep going      hugs       I'd get one  stat    Unless I was feeling awful   Then I'd get one after as soon as it passed   EDIT   I don't want to die   At least  not all the time   I suppose those would be considered more desirable frames of mind   I just don't know if I'll be in a position to get help  ever  considering how I am   I simply realize that my sensitivity to death and suicide is slowly eroding  I can project the probable implications  Thank you so much  That is so helpful  Would you recommend consultation with a maternal fetal medicine specialist before becoming pregnant   That means so much  way to go  The struggle with depression and hygiene is very real floating  waiting to leave  Been there and done that with the whole college thing  I too was bitter about what happened after high school and nobody staying in touch  I've learned to let that go but again  like you it has affected my ability to connect and meet likeminded people  I honestly believe it's mentally damaged me being let down like that  Just like when somebody gets cheated on for example  it never really goes away   When I was in college the only form of social contact I had was fellow students on my course  Outside of lesson time though my time was spent messing about on the computers playing games and browsing Reddit to try and find people in my situation  It was an extremely lonely experience which escalated the depressive feelings  Even though I rarely spent time with my classmates outside of lesson time  I still genuinely thought they cared about me  which messed me up even more    I hardly trust people now a days  Saying that though I decided to say fuck it and get two tattoos which are both reminders that I am going forwards and to not look back  Right now I've only got a part time job but even that's 10 000 times better than being in that hellhole of a place  You're not alone man  things can work out  I just unfortunately don't really have answers as I'm dealing with it myself   I'm sorry  Feel free to message me if you'd like to talk   Mine did a preliminary diagnosis after the first session and then always updated it  I dont know if every psychiatrist is like this  or if they have to allow it  but I could always see it when I wanted  Not helpful for me  But everyone is different   Nothing much is on my mind right now  just extremely worried about my future  I'm feeling quite upbeat for a change  not sure why  better make the most of it  How about you OP   I think I'd say the same  too  Anxiety is more of a constant thing but the level of depression comes and goes  I do think you're right about just knowing what's going on  That would probably be a good step in the right direction  I'll be setting up an appointment at the counseling center as soon as campus reopens  Thanks very much for your thoughts  I hate social media  I only follow photography pages on Instagram and use messenger to stay in touch  I have unfollowed basically every vain self centred asshat I had followed back in school  There's a saying "social media is a show real featuring only your best parts" and that's all they really are  people pretending that they live these amazing fantasy lives  Why do they do it  Self worth  Attention  Who the fuck knows  all I know is that it's cancer  That is exactly how I feel    I never had friends or anyone who liked me when I was just being myself  I had to craft up this fake me that was my antithesis in every aspect of my personality  Or they use me b c I have good grades  comparatively   Or they just end of up using my "sweetness"  quoting from someone else not my own words  and toying with it for their pleasure  Now that I have junior year creeping up my ass I can't succumb to this pressure either  It's like I'm backed in a corner and I have to go forward  Only reason suicide isn't an option is b c I have an autistic brother and a financially tight family that needs me to succeed  Wanna pm sometime  I'm not satisfied with my lifestyle  I just feel helpless  I have no friends  I long for a close friend  I don't want "friends" who just want to socialize party etc  I want someone I can talk to  trust  confide in  vacation with  Always sad  never happy  I've offered to help someone "close" and was turned down  that hurt   I want to live by "treat others as you would like to be treated" but everyone is so content with how their lives are going  they already have their own group of close friends and wont really branch out anymore    no one has time in their life for people like me Have you checked this support group   http   www dbsalliance org site PageServer pagename peer support group locator Do you know for sure   I wonder  in bed or seated "active activities"  Thinks like stretches  crunches  pulls  holds  etc  Disclaimer that I  thanking the heavens  haven't gotten to the point where getting out of bed is too much to consider on a regular basis   The first step is sitting up  I guess my thought is that if you sit up  you can start thinking "oh  sitting up is the starting position for this stretch or that pose  why don't I give that a try"  then you're at least getting a bit moving  which could help with the "fog"   Completely lost the rest of the thought train there  sorry  I'll let you know if I find it  she just gave you a lame nonsensical excuse   try not to dwell too hard on that loser  I've been friendless  so to speak  for like five years now  It's not a good place to be  In my situation I ruined important friendships with words  but that put me in a state of social shock where I just can't handle friendship anymore   It's hard to make friends with anyone if you aren't spending time with them to begin with  People don't just meet and make friends  I don't even waste my time thinking about the opposite gender these days  When I encounter one I try not to pay any attention  because it's pointless   I think you still have hope  Are you at the point where you mass delete innocent facebook contacts  Are you so terrified of communication that you can barely communicate with people in person or on the internet  Is your suffering a product of your own selfishness where ambition has been replaced with instant gratification   If not  I think you still have hope  I think it's ok to go a few months to a year feeling friendless  but if it goes any longer you have to redefine friendship to suite what's available to you for the sake of sanity  just start banging lots of women bare back  eventually it will work out  Might not happen before all that pleasure changes your outlook  but don't get anyone prego  that would fuck up a 2nd life  Every fucking day  I know that suicide will hurt my mother and sister  so I hope that I wake up with heart disease or an aggressive cancer  Unfortunately  I am too healthy and stuck living a life I never wanted   I wish i could do that  i already do a lot of my own stuff looking after myself  sadly i'm not legally allowed to move out until i'm 18  i turn 15 this year so i have 3 more years until i can move out     Wow it seems like the world's really piled it on  I'm sorry  That's really shitty  and I hope that you're able to have a day or two to regroup and be able to take the new year on   no because I can easily off myself at any time by getting some drugs in Mexico and technically  if I do have depression  then that took my life   not me  This sub is completely useless for helping depressed people   Well fuck me up a wall  I managed a full half hour  only 7 5 mins below that level 4 in total and even managed Level 5    Feels nice when you're not even sure you're going to make it 10 minutes  Yeah  i already go to a counselor in my own time       Very proud of you  Thank you for bringing this up  I thought I was alone in this and so many people are posting similar things  Happy New Year   For me life is hell but i know that there is a person that has it worse   "Telling someone they shouldn't be sad because someone else has it worse is the same as telling someone they shouldn't be happy because someone else has it better"  Some guy probably  or maybe some girl    I feel you completely though  There's a fine line between trying to make it clear that you have your cross to bear  and putting yourself up on that cross  I hate the feeling of being pitied  but at the same time depression is part of my experience and I need to be able to honest about that fact  It's tough   same  sometimes I say I'm just tired  it's almost like a taboo to mention the word   yeah i already go to a counselor in my own personal time and thank you for the support  my parents aren't physically abusive at all but they do definitely not help with the things they say to me    Unfortunately I think you're pretty right about that  A lot of threads go without responses  Responses themselves are often not people trying to help OP  but trying to receive help themselves  I don't know  This place does give people a place to vent and feel like they're not alone with their problems  That's something at least   I been feeling like that too  Just tired of living I'm the same way except I'm contemplating suicide so that I don't have to be around for the deaths   I honestly dread one day hearing   your mother is dead   I don't want to hear that  Not too great but I have enough experience with depression now to work through it  even a little bit   To be honest you may have made her feel unwanted  I would have picked her up   Still a lame excuse to break up but still   all she wanted was a ride home and you left her hanging  If you had asked your girlfriend for a ride home because you could not drive  how would you feel  I would pretty rejected and not thought of    Well it's a new year and all i know is that i find comfort in computers  producing music  and cutting myself  Nobody around me understands shit thats going on with me and i don't care to explain to them either  Luckily I'm rarely on social media  so I don't have the issue of blocking people out of my life  I do sometimes obsess over Snapchat  which imo is one of the most toxic social media platforms  But for the most part my main issue is not with making friends  necessarily  but with keeping them  I'm not bad at being friendly  funny  or interesting  People still decide not to become friends with me  I'm hopeful that I'll figure it all out  but it's hard when people you grew up with suddenly kick you out of their lives  It makes me hate myself  even when deep down I believe there's nothing wrong with me  it isn't just because of my parents  its also because of school as i used to get bullied since year 3  i dont really get bullied much now but i don't have many friends  i also have many other things what have contributed but those are the main things   Maybe sometimes we don't want to hear the truth  We want to hear something which says you'll do great  It'll all workout  No big deal  It's tough for you but it'll be okay cuz you are not the only one  Hugs with SO are the best thing    really  they haven't harmed me physically in any way besides once and i always hear about more abusive family's compared to mine  Sadly I don't think people view it that way  You aren't throwing your life away at all  it's just taking a little bit longer than expected  I did 7 months of an 8 month medical assistant program and dropped out because it didn't feel like it was actually preparing me for the job  Now I'm about to sign up for nursing school  8 years later  so i'm in the same boat basically  Don't feel like a failure  You'll get there   i do currently go to a councilor in my own time and i dont really have anybody to talk to at school   thank you for the support im sorry that you are going through that too     I already had a panic attack and crying session  Wow great year so far  Are you unsatisfied with life  With other people   Sometimes bad feelings come about in situations where you should otherwise feel good  Usually a good scare will open my eyes to the things in life I shouldn't take for granted  If I screw something up  I tend to work harder as a result  Maybe you've been working so hard and so well that you don't think it's important anymore   It's important to find perspective as you get older  Life isn't perfect  but there are a lot of things that are good about it  There are likely many things that you can experience that other will never have the opportunity to do  even if it's something mundane like walking around the kitchen or using the internet  You could have been a slave or a fallen soldier or an insect or something  but you are you and you don't have to be the greatest just to survive and have a good time now and then   It's very common for people of recent generations to feel a sense of purposelessness  In many ways  many have no purpose beyond what's within their reach  Purpose to oneself and purpose to other people  A person can do things to make them more important to other people  but that isn't necessary and probably impossible for everyone to participate in  Loneliness is tolerable as long as you don't focus on things that are beyond your reach  thank you  you too     I tried to do this within the first week i noticed a huge change in my teeths color when taking picture they looked really white and then i started smoking    And now i have a mouth infection i think from eating too much spicy foods and not washing my teeth lol for like a week only washed em like 2 a week they look yellow not bad yellow idk if its a mouth infection or not buts something cuz i got bumps in my mouth and random cuts are appearing mom just keeps saying yeah its an infection but doesnt do any thing about it lol im 17 i cant do anything NO  I dont think you are at all  forcing you to see someone who youve already hhad a bad experence with is stupid I already had a mental breakdown and I think I inflicted some damage to myself during a verbal batter with my S o   im so sorry to hear that you are in the same situation as me        i don't know for sure   but she said she was going to  So now whats your next goal  "Its the little things that matter " I'm addicted to TV but it's hard for me to watch movies  I think it's because a lot of "good" movies are depressing and I just want to watch a comedy so I can shut my brain off for a while  I have a theory that depressed people love comedy because we need the escape  and my friends who like serious dramatic entertainment don't suffer from the depression or anxiety that would make them affect you  Just throwing that out there   Yes totally agree i thought i was the only one  Computers make me feel normal Im going to school for network engineering its the first time Ive ever been excited for institutionalized learning my entire life  Xbox is also another good way and it turns out you find people on xbox that arent shitty like people irl   I can empathize with your feelings  What helps me is sitting down and really thinking about what truly makes me happy  I suggest getting to know yourself during this time  You want to eat dinner  go eat dinner  You want to see a movie  go see it  You want to read a book  read a book  You wanna take a walk  do it  Often times we feel like we're losers because we're alone but the truth is  in order to be truly happy we must know ourselves and do what makes us happy  Once we figure out how to be truly happy without others around  we start to attract the right kinds of people    I was really depressed and sometimes I still get down but I remember the things that I truly love to do and make me happy  I'm really shy and introverted but I like books  so I started going to small bookstores perusing the shelves for interesting reads  I like football so I'll grab a cheap ticket to a football game and go alone  I LOVE different kinds of food so I started trying new restaurants and online recipes that I think I may enjoy  Take the time to enjoy your own company  It doesn't make you a loser  it makes you smart  And once you truly get to know yourself  like I said  you start to attract people who like similar things  I met a really cool guy at a Chargers game who sat next to me and we are now bonding because he was doing something similar by going to the games alone too  He too  was feeling like a loser and lonely but after getting out  doing the things that he wanted to do  he  like myself  found people who were in similar situations    Often times we feel like nobody understands but in reality  there are more people than you think dealing with similar feelings  Once you get to know yourself  I promise it gets easier  It doesn't happen overnight  especially if you're like me and have social anxiety but if you put forth the effort and truly become ok with being alone  I promise it'll get easier  i already try to avoid them as much as possible  thank you for the support Are you in the USA  If so  check out your local Community Service Board  CSB   They have sliding scales for services  If you google it for your state you should get a list  Good luck Well as scary as it is  you need to find out  Call her  go to her  just be supportive of her  make her know she loved   Thank you  But I've been apart of them for 6 months  For example that one subreddit hasn't been active for 2 weeks  Like Jesus Christ  This is suppose to be one of the largest cities in America and I can't find anything  Wtf no i live in Australia  the earliest you can work is 14 here  thank you for the concern though   yes i watched their summer marathon too    Yeah  I don't know   Maybe my parents are just assholes for charging me rent   But where I live a single bedroom apartment goes for 600 1200 depending on how good the neighborhood is   I can't afford that I barely make 1500 take home pay a month as it is   I don't have anyone in mind that I would be comfortable living with    What did you eat for 50 bucks a month   Ramen    I'm working on my student loan  I sold a car recently and I'm going to put all 8k towards my debt   My life is so boring and poor though  I can't afford to do anything now    Nobody ever needs to be alone  I am sure there are adults that care but it is OK if you have not found someone you trust yet     What things do you enjoy doing outside of school   The friend that insists you don't have Bipolar  where did they get their PhD   I'm just curious  I didn't understand what i was supposed to be celebrating  Was i supposed to be happy i made it to another year  eh  Fun for everyone else maybe  apparently the cops won't care about what they are doing  according to them  Why does the nomenclature matter so much  You know who you are  and you know how you act  You can use the classification to help yourself  but nothing about you has charged  only how much you know to help yourself       i already go to a counselor in my own time out side of school    thank you for your concern though Heard that  I skipped around schools so I never had a good couple of years or so to make friends  and my job kind of sucks  not a lot of friend material  It just gets harder as you get older  im sorry to hear that      Bipolar is a condition known to sometimes go into remission  Remission is NOT PERMANENT  It's temporary  Eventually you may find yourself in deep shit again  and it's often easier to simply prevent this rather than risk it broadsiding you    Also  mild depression or hypomania can totally "fly under the radar" and leave us thinking we're okay when  in reality  we are not  We just don't remember things being "off"   Nobody here can tell you if your diagnosis was accurate or not  There are so many  many factors involved  It might be worth a visit with a pdoc  to explain your history to them and get an informed opinion  there are no words    i'm so sorry as best you can  surround yourself with kind people and try to just keep putting one foot in front of the other hmm i know    sadly we cannot choose who our parents family are  and i know a lot more people have it worse then me too    I binge watched the new season of Black Mirror  Honestly  I wasn't too upset with that night  Most upsetting was not having any invites  and I'm not looking forward to people asking me what I did because I feel like a loser saying I didn't do anything  But I think there's a lot of us that didn't do anything  if it makes you feel any better  I doubt it  It doesn't change reality  Unless you're getting lit with your favorite people doing your favorite things accomplishing fantastic achievements and experiencing life changing epiphanies  it's just a temporary relief   I use  but it doesn't change the facts of what keeps me down  Some things can never be fixed  Pot is a pleasant distraction  something to look forward to  but it can put me in a worse mood sometimes that I have to beat out of my head before I feel relaxed   Maybe it depends on the person  Maybe an overworked grad school yuppie could get out of a rut by smoking a joint on the weekend  but for a forever depressed and purposeless person to do it on their own  they might as well do it every day because that's all it's good for  Watching for suggestions  Same problem   I've had a dramatic experience in early 2016 which resulted in the loss of all my friends  I think the best thing to do in this situation  as I'm still pulling myself out of it  is taking this as an opportunity to learn more about yourself  Yeah  it's a lil' cheesy  but I really benefited from it  Separate yourself from all of your ex pals  and take a little while to be independent and focus on your personal development  Friends will find you  you just have to let them  A lot of people are suggesting you join clubs  and I really agree with them because that's probably the only reason I have some kind of friends right now  Same  I'm trying to figure out ways to improve myself and figure out a way to get out of this hell hole   thats the one thing that motivates me to keep on going  i know that eventually things will change  i dont know if it will be better or not though   i plan on moving out as soon as i hit 18  or maybe even earlier if i end up having a close friend at that time  I just hate how its all brain crap thinki g in cicles and never escaping  like theres no escape  sleeps alright  dieing is a garranteed escape but what we all really want is to just be better  until you cant imagine better  which is fucking horrible thank you for your support I enjoy playing video games  but now it's getting to the point where I'm showing a lack of interest towards games  I enjoy basketball  even though I'm not good at it  but recently moved and there's no basketballs courts around where I live  thank you for your support i currently live in Australia and no  but i do talk to a Counselor in my own time outside of school Again  thank you for sharing  I can relate to a lot of what you are saying  Something that can help me is realizing that some of these "issues"  maybe situations  or struggles  are the result of major societal things going on and it's not just me  I just want to be better  It's hard imaging the future  but I want the future I think  I want friends and happiness and laughter and love    I've been having a tough week  I wanted to help some people out  but it backfired on me  Might lose a friend because I might have lost her trust in the process  Thus  I have reverted to having suicidal thoughts  In other news  I started a journal to list things I experience and feel that relates to my mental health  Okay  I understand  How come you'd wait  What things  if you don't mind me asking  You cannot  You will have to activate your account to use messenger  Ah ok Is there a local hospital you can contact   If so  chances are they have a few local resources for you  Also  check your local library town hall bulletin boards   Best of luck  I hope you find the support you crave    "Thing 1" is acting like a shit friend for down playing your issue to nothing  Let me guess     "Everyone goes through similar issues  that doesnt make you bipolar" is the argument   Explain to them  if they cant be apart of the support system then dont give any input  If they dont respect it  Drop them   Their are websites that do live chats as a group in regards to having support   As far as making new friends with the same issue or worse     The intent is well  but you being 18  you dont understand the concept of not getting overly involved with other issues you dont need in your life   With or without mental health issues a good friend should be able to respect the disorder and carry on as normal  Dont feel limited  and dont over extend yourself to people    Okay  Do you feel as if that'll be different with a different therapist  I feel worse because I know nobody will ever actually say these things to me  Definitely because the hug can become intimate with roaming hands haha  Hugs with SO can be affectionate and sexual making them more emotional and intimate fulfilling multiple needs at once  while hugs with everyone else is limited to just affection  There's no easy way to make depression just disappear  drugs may just help you manage it but likely won't cure you Yeah I know anti Natalism  I majored in philosophy and my old roommate did too  We talk about all sorts of stuff like this  Though I do appreciate the recommendation  I'll probably lurk around an anti Natalism sub later  Agreed  I'm not encouraging suicide by any means  but don't traumatize another human being in carrying it out  if that is the decision you've made  There are cleaner ways   I'm crying right now   I'm very introverted and don't connect to a lot of people which makes it hard finding someone I actually want to date   I have a similar problem  I feel like I have a very rich and vivid inner life  but that's very difficult to share with other people  You spend so long coping with being alone it becomes hard to connect   Not weed  but I tried MDMA once and it was like I remembered what being happy felt like  Haven't done it since but I've been happier overall since then  Weed helps with my anxiety tho Yeah    if it's possible for you to set out clothing food car keys etc the night before that can help  although not much will get you out of bed if you don't want to   Depression definitely sucks  I've lost so many years to it     'What a beautiful name'   I don't even really identify with my name Not okay  but alive  I appreciate you asking  thank you for the support sorry to hear that     thank you for the support I thought about that question often and come up with different answers each time  So I don't know  The other question is  "Do I even want to try " At this point  no  I always feel like there is some great grid of social connectedness to which I am not plugged in  and I can never quite seem to find my own cord or the receptacle that would accept it   The best days I can fake it  and sometimes almost feel it  the worst days I feel like there is a wall of glass between myself and everyone else and I am trapped behind it   This has kept a lot of people from getting to know me  and as a result  I have very few friends  I just run on a different wavelength   Fuck man It's interesting how me and a lot of other people look at Holidays as the WORST days to look forward to  It's hell because everyone is happy around you  and you just want as many hours at work as you can to needle and numb the fucking pain  Fuck holidays  and fuck christmas   thanks for the support     You don't deserve those kind of people in your life at all  You need to find a positive place for sure   For now  I want you to try this  write down things about yourself you are proud of  Doesn't matter how big or small  or what it looks like next to someone else's accomplishment and whatnot  I want you to write it down  Then  write things that you enjoy doing  Wholesome things  preferably  Write down people that are good to you  Plan out a day for yourself and your friends  and enjoy it  If you feel like it's undeserved  just think back to those things you are proud of  and think of how many there are to come  Set some goals for you as a gift to yourself  you don't have to be who you were  You can't change the past  so why dwell on it  Look to what you have power over  the present and the future  There are so  so many possibilities  You might be thinking oh it's just sappy babble  but really  try it  Don't look too far ahead  you can't become a millionaire overnight  but look at whatever the next steps are in your life it's important to take things by steps  because sometimes you choose different paths along the way  Ex  Feeling out of shape  Don't think about how you need to be a bodybuilder  Think about how you'll go for a jog every day of the week for a month  Then plan where you want to go from there  R thexeffect is a great community for setting goals and following though with them  In fact  Reddit has many  many tools that can help you  Give yourself some worth  some purpose  Investing in oneself is always worth it  I want you to go out and celebrate  if not for the things you are proud of  then for the things that could be  a celebration of the potential that I know you have  If you want to talk  pm me  and happy birthday    im so sorry you had to go through that  my parents are the same when it comes to convincing everyone that nothings wrong Sometimes I get really sad  but I'm thankful to have a friend like  u snapundersteer that understands me  It's been rough  but he's always been there for me Following this for future advice  I would just love to know more about being pregnant new mom while having bipolar for the someday that my husband and I are ready  I have a huge fear of PPD or worse psychosis  Take long daily walks  They help to clear the mind  In my opinion  depression is anger turned inward  Anger mostly at ourselves  Anger from not achieving satisfaction  But it takes skills to achieve satisfaction  Therefore skill development  any skill  is the key to being satisfied  ie happy   Sometimes it helps to tell people and realize that they love you anyway  There are so few people that I have been able to tell  Many of my friends know I am BP1  but very few people know what that actually means  That's good to know that you have found coping mechanisms that work  My school had a BP therapy group   check with counseling psychological services  You might also have a local NAMI or DBSA chapter  Thanks for the advice   I think she means well  she just thinks she knows more about psychology than she really does  There's also the fact that the only times she's seen me "manic" have been when I only felt slightly  pleasantly buzzed on hypomania  therefore  my symptoms do not exist  and I clearly only experience "normal" mood swings  Nevermind the fact that I tried to jump off a cliff   She does have many redeeming qualities  so in the meantime I'm just avoiding the topic with her  I feel similar but with anime   Everyone in anime seems so happy and with amazing and interesting lives inhabiting great worlds   I know that it's all fiction but it still makes me super depressed it's like putting salt on a wound   Also it makes me envious how many anime fans spend thousands of dollars on figurines and merch I would like to be able to afford that but I'm a student with a minimum wage job  I am so happy I did this  I didn't delete it because its convenient as a log in but I did stop going on it  I never check it now and feel much better having done so  The messenger is still useful as well  Shrinks for parents and a psych major  I think she's just accustomed to being the most psychologically knowledgeable person in the room at any given time  given that most people know next to nothing   and this has given her the impression that she's an expert  when clearly  she is not  Your dad is ignorant  If a medical professional tells you you have it  odds are doctor is right  and your dad is wrong Facebook memes are stupid anyway   I was without social media for the last 4 years and only recently got it back for networking purposes  I do video production  and my depression has been noticeably worse since I got it back  Coincidence   I think you should repost this in  r BipolarSOs  This is not really the right place   this is a place for people  with  bipolar disorder to find support  I don't know what is going on with your son  and I am sorry you're having such a bad time  but bipolar disorder does not involve  to the best of my knowledge  violent outbursts out of nowhere when someone's mood otherwise seems to be ok  I know mania often involves violence but I don't think mania can just suddenly start and stop like that  If this is mania related  obviously talking about consequences won't help   NAMI friend family support groups may also be helpful for you  I'm perfectly fine with drugs just helping me manage  Genesight com they help match med treatment your genome  Maybe he gives such good advice from these kinds of experiences   I had to get an EKG recently  I think because I was going on vraylar  This is very normal  I've had a similar experience with a friend who would be  constantly  texting me telling me how everyone hated him  how he wanted to die  how he was struggling and I was the only one there for him   even when he was at parties with people all around him    I eventually had to tell him to only message me like that when it was an absolute crisis   I said something to the effect of 'Look  I love you  but it makes  my  anxiety and depression much worse to have you texting me like that all the time  I'm still here if you need me  but I'd like it if you tried to talk to some of the people around you'    He still messages me occasionally  but I have space to myself now I'd love to hear why you think so of yourself  Because I want to prove you wrong  My psychiatrist said medication doesn't alter your personality  It just strengthens the good parts of personality Do you have health insurance   Thanks for the link  Unfortunately  they don't have one in my area  I did the same thing  It's been two weeks  Got rid of Instagram too  but decided to keep twitter because it's nice to vent every so often  I find I'm waaaayyyy less anxious and definitely more present  It's really helping  Good luck  I myself have struggled with this opinion of myself    However I believe in something I was told once  That regardless of someone having it "worse"  everyone that has gone through something deserves attention and care to heal from it   i think not their are a lot of normies but once you find the right page it's pretty good Spotify was my issue too  I cancelled my subscription with my Facebook connected Spotify account  then I made a new Spotify account and followed my old account with all of my old playlists  then deleted Facebook  Spotify was my excuse for not deleting Facebook for 2 years and I feel so liberated now  Sorry  I wish I had something else   yup i made an extra account with no friends except for my family for messaging purposes only right     clusterfuck of a social spiderweb  hahahaa exactly  make an alt acc and add the people u want to message  thats what i did True  But really there are enough memes on Reddit that my meme intake is already saturated as it is  yea lol the memes made me laugh and i used it for messaging but fuck it im willing to sacrifice that shit because in the long run  FB makes me feel like crap   the good thing about deleting FB is that it instantly gives you the ability to sense fake friends and real friends   Ive dealt w  dysthymia for a good portion of my life w  bouts of major depression here and there as well as anxiety issues  It also makes me not want to brush my teeth and due to health probs my teeth went from being perfect in 2005  to now I need full dentures  Cant afford it right now and I only have medicaid and there is a long wait to get into a dentist  My front top teeth are broken so bad I got a hole at the base of 2 of them i could stick a pencil eraser into  and the infection goes up to my sinus  and is making me ill  The pain is excruciating  If there is anything that will make your depression spiral out of control it is knowing your about to have all your teeth out at the age of 31  Its a most terrible kind of pain and feeling and it makes me have thoughts that Id rather not have about ending it  If I manage to get these teeth pulled it will be wonderful  or maybe not  Don't let depression take your teeth if u can help it  well it's deleted and no one will be able to access your page or old photos unless you log back in and restore it  Well said my best friend that i've fallen in love with broke ties with me because i didn't approve of her doing drugs in a groupchat that she wasnt in and she got hurt and broke me off   i hurt so much  Yes no one deserves to be depressed   This is how you're experiencing your life     People experience depression differently   Some are more "high functioning "  Our outside world looks good but we hurt inside   The severity of depression is on a continuum   Some have a milder symptoms  others severe   It sounds like a bit of what's going on is a search for meaning and mission in your life   It's hard to not have some identity    You won't know until you  try it   will you  I mean  what's the alternative  Just go on and on feeling like that  Why go through it when there's hope that things can get better  Yes but does it also maybe give people a chance to sort of wallow in negativity  which could be a bad thing  I've gotten worse since I started lurking here  most of that is because I've been dealing with some tough stuff but could part of it also be that reading this sub gives an unhealthy space to ruminate about how shitty my life is  Perhaps some of it also is opening up about your problems which could be constructive vs  just lurking which could be bad  Also I think it could be bad that we don't see many success stories  "I beat my depression" etc  here  I'm sure there are people who get help and get better  but that's mostly not this sub's audience  which could make things seem more hopeless than perhaps they are  aw  that's awful  was the person who showed up nice at least  and did you have a good time with them  I was really hoping today would be different   It wasn't  Just did the same  Thanks for inspiring confidence  The new year and holidays really do that  What's up  Great job  I'm trying to encourage a friend to do the same thing for her anxiety    Last year  I deleted instagram  I had a lot of difficulty getting over a break up last yeae  and because it's easier to control Facebook's content  I just decided to tweak my fb but delete instagram  I used to redownload it every now and then just to post something  but then I would delete it right after  But in all honesty  it feels so nice not to have so much social media hanging above your head  It feels nice to be able to let people know that social media and publicity doesn't rule my life  Not latly for me  Weed tis nice but it can make things pretty bad if you use it in the wrong way like if you are anxios or just t sad Its best t avoid for me   I relate  A family member of mine just passed away because she didn't take care of her teeth for years  She got an infection and it got into her blood stream  So there are certainly serious reasons to stay on top of your dental hygiene   You couldn't have described this any better  This is exactly me  especially at work   I actually read somewhere recently that you can sign up for the Facebook messenger app even if you're not on Facebook  you just need a cellphone number  I mean  it won't be the disabled account  but you can still use the app  I just had a moment  I had to talk to my dad about spending money on college apps and he got upset  I don't really like talking to my parents about things that I need help on  It makes me feel like a burden  and they don't really help when they make me feel bad about it  He said I should've told him even earlier and that he didn't even know what colleges I wanted to go to  It's not like they ever ask  or really show interest in what goes on in my life  I guess I should've told him earlier  but I didn't build up the courage to until now  Spending Christmas together didn't help at all  either  I didn't get anything besides one gift card for  50  Which is better than nothing  but I'm pretty sure the family dog got better things than I did  Maybe I'm just being greedy  I guess  I just wish overall they knew me  cared enough to know me  but they don't  I'm not saying I have a bad life  They take care of me  make sure my basic needs are met  send me to school  etc  I have friends and I'm not anti social or anything  I just wish someone would see me for me  I work really hard  or think I do  so someone would tell me for once they were proud of me  My dad asked for my report card after I told him about my fees  It had all A's except for one B   It always scares me to hand it over  I try to avoid it as long as I can  I burned a report card once just so I wouldn't have to show them  But it's not like my grades are ever bad  Almost always A's and a couple of B's except for two years when I went through a rough patch but even then I dropped down to two C's  But nothing's ever acceptable and I should always be better  He just looked at it and went "Okay " That was the same response I got when I managed to get all A's one time  It feels pretty crappy afterwards  To sum it up  I guess  I'm just a kid wanting approval and someone to listen    Sorry if that's all just a jumbled mess and if I just sound melodramatic  Just needed an outlet  at the end of the day   it was me who had to persuade myself to delete FB  my mom tried telling me to delete it but it didnt work  give your buddy some time     and yeah i spent wayyyyy too much time on FB anyway  im so fuckin happy its outta my life no problem bro  delete that shit I read your post  thanks for it You probably just deactivated it  The actual delete page is difficult to find  so you'll probably have to Google it  That's what I did when I deleted mine  It will deactivate initially but be permanently deleted after two weeks as long as you don't log in  I guess Facebook really doesn't want people to leave  Thanks   it helps to know I'm not the only one    I've joined the gym to get to know a few more people  Think finding more hobbies will help  I guess time will tell   Sometimes I feel this way too      What I'm going through right now is emotional PTSD from a shitty relationship  I guess a part of me is still having trouble believing that I'm suffering from PTSD and that part of me says "dude  you're just going through a break up  you're not depressed  just get over it"  This part of me also says that other people have it worse and that I don't deserved to claim that I have depression   This is gonna sound weird  but what has really helped me accept my circumstances is the movie "inside  out" I think it's the most accurate way to describe depression  Tl dr  inside out shows that we can feel helpless when something of value to us  suddenly feels like it doesn't exist anymore   i e  if family is important to us  but maybe our family is going through a tough time  we can feel helpless and this depression    Please   whatever you do do not commit suicide    Please message me if you need to   This feeling sucks since u relate we can relate on that  But do not commit suicide please for the sake of your family's feelings but I definitely know what you mean but I couldn't do that either knowing it would kill them inside  I know this is months late  but those drugs are dopamine agonists  They've been known to trigger compulsions in people who have never had them before  Sex  gambling  shopping  drugs  all become potentially irresistible draws for some people on that class of medication  I don't know about OP  but if that was an option for me  I don't think I'd worry about having depression anymore lol Same  you can pm me if you want  I would like to talk to someone else going through chronic depression too  It kinda mellows down when you realize that time is sort of a social construct and a year's transition to another is similar to a week's  with its respective implications regarding the responsibility of bettering your own life   I say so because I feel the same as you  Someone finally said it   Experience Project was a nice option for me and a lot of people  Unfortunately  it got closed down   Thanks for reminding me  I was gonna do that after I graduated and didn't need messenger anymore or as often  No  Thank you for being that guy  seriously    I'd rather learn than not  Happy New Year to you too  Telll a doctor your depresseds  Some people find SSRIs helpful  they never did much foe me   wellbutrin was the only antidepressant that ever worked for me  I find CBD helps me too  Same  Wanna make a pact  Am serious They don't know what they are missing  Hope you are having a great party     Okay brother  Thanks for your concern     no problemo  you wont regret it  btw  if you still might need messenger  make an extra account and add the people you might need to message  then download the messenger app on ur phone   Rejection always hurts  but it's better to have told her  Now you know she's thinking of other people  you aren't wasting time swooning over something unattainable   If there was ever a post to describe my depression  this would be it  I have friends that are so much worse off than me  yet I have the nerve to say I'm depressed  I'm sorry  I wish there was some way I could help  I know saying "I know how you feel" doesn't help  but  Idk   I'm sorry for your situation  same I actually did the same about a week or so ago  unfortunately the reaction was quite different  My father left the room  I think that he just doesn't know how to handle this kind of situation   and my mother seemed to be annoyed with me  saying that I have no reason to be depressed  Moving on  I am glad that your parents are supportive of you  and good luck with your future  Happy new year    not been online for 2 years but it cause i forgot my password email ugh every birthday of mine havent since i was 11 or 12 Don't worry I have changed since high school as well  I also get told the same stuff you hear as well  At this point  I don't care since I am at peace being alone  It's hard for people to fathom that someone enjoys being alone 24 7  but that's who I am not sorry for it  Depression is clearly causing you to change and with every mental illness  it only gets worse as you get older   no sad tbh Oh I was thinking more along the lines if there's anything your boyfriend can do to help you  Have you thought about taking anti depressants   Tell you what  You pay for me to fix my teeth and I'll take better care of them  Deal  Nice I think I'm gonna do that too Man I relate to this so much it's crazy  I'm just stuck in a hole right now  Feel like there's nothing I can do or want to do Thank you for replying  I didn't think of it that way  yea pretty much But time isn't a social construct  its very real and its always moving forward  You can talk to me but I'm gonna fall asleep soon D  I started facebook over the summer hoping I might be able to stay in touch with friends from high school  graduated in the spring   Nope  Not sure what good I thought it'd do  or why I'm still there  No problem  same shits been happening to me for last 3 months before I let go  If I had 3 months ago  I would've been much better off today   Try to go for a new hobby  Maybe a simple one like drawing I have this problem aswell so I tried finding movies or series where the characters doesnt have good careers etc     Im currently watching  Flash  Arrow  Person of interest and Touch if you're interested    I cant say for sure that this will help but it has for me so I thought I would share   As someone who is also in high school and depressed I'm really holding out until college  I'm going through the roughest time right now but I have hope that college will change things for me  That's how I feel  especially since I'm in high school  feeling invisible is so painful  That's why I decided to go to every club meetings as many as I can this year because then people would notice that I exist   But I'm still not satisfied  I still feel invisible  No one wants to be friends with me unless I completely open up and throw myself at them and that's when they barely start noticing me  This year wasn't all that bad  I made 3 good friends and that's amazing considering I've never had any good friends  But still  I keep thinking that even if I don't exist  my friends can probably live without me and the thought of it makes me die inside  I'm not that important and I'll never be  I'm never going to be important enough to be a part of anything  I wouldn't stay friends with her  because jealousy will arise when she's dating other people  And let me guess  you don't think you can get someone you like as much as her  Alright  let's just say chances are you won't right now  You can always change  but it's hard to change when you're depressed  By the way  what exact words did you tell her when you said you had feelings for her  I don't want you to kill anyone  Just saying  Including you  of course  but that's for you to say  not for you to say for someone else      sorry if this was a joke but it's a dark one and I think we're all a little on edge here  Why  Sometimes it helps to have a private fb account just for yourself and for the groups you like  memes   humor      That's what I use it for  Don't worry about the future man  it'll take care of itself  Did they RSVP     Only one person showed up and the dude is clearly not happy about it  saying stuff like "they don't know what they are missing" just make you sound unrelatable  I know you mean well and my goal isn't to make you feel bad  but  statements like that can seem really out of touch with reality   I've confessed to friends 3 times so far in my life and got rejected every single time  but even though I'm still friends with them  things have become different and I often feel like I ruined our friendship by telling them  I think it's best to tell them though Definitely look for support groups  Sometimes they're hard to find  especially if you already said there is no DBSA in your area  NAMI is another national resource group  Most of my friends have mental disorders  everyone in my close group  including my boyfriend   but that was more by chance and crazy people tend to group together  Sometimes it's easy to tell if someone has a mental disorder  You can always try clubs in your college  I know mine has psychology clubs and creative writing  Both tend to have those type of people in them  and I'd definitely say the majority would at least understand it well  Try finding stuff like that that you take interest in and make friends  There's some force that groups us together  When we meet someone else with a disorder  even if you don't know  there's a connection that usually forms  I was thinking of taking a break from being friends just to sort myself out  You pretty much hit the nail on the head  Something like this  "Hey  I really love spending time with you and Im starting to have feelings for you beyond friendship  I hope you might feel the same way too  and Id like to take you out on a proper date   I have met some of the wealthiest people in the world who feel empty inside  There is no shame in that   Look at Kate Winslet in Titanic   No one would blame her for being depressed     If you don't mind me asking  Were they your friend before you asked  Guys  I feel like when I'm busy  I feel fine  But during the school break  I feel very depressed  And when I express myself to people  they always says things to temporarily relieve my depression like exercising or having a positive mindset   I've been thinking that life is meaningless  I used to feel that family  friends  love  and passion are all meaningful  But  in the end  everything is meaningless  Am I right  Or What is the ultimate meaning  I keep coming back to this question for 2 years  I can feel for a several months  but then  I get back to the same situation  Questioning my own existence and meaning   Same here  I kind of got used to not celebrating anything really   This is kinda different than what all the previous comments say  but podcasts are a good way to zone out and entertain yourself  They don't have all the perfection of tv  Joe Rogan Experience  Welcome to Night Vale  No Sleep  which is based off the subreddit  are a few that I listen to  You can listen to them while driving or exercising  There's bound to be some about what you like  Same thing with audio books  They've helped me out and when I went a while without listening to any  everything got worse    Just a suggestion  Hope it helps  I'm sorry it is a pretty tough pill to swallow  She really is a great friend and I hope I'd be able to remain friends with her at some point  Yeah I'm happy I worked up the nerve to tell her  but I should've prepped more for the aftermath  If you are looking for something that allows you to rest  I recommend watching indie movies  where there's actually emotional depth   or watching comedy  or humor for some laughs   If you like something more pro active  I'd suggest baking   Baking is the best   You can't go wrong when cookies and cake are the end result of what you're creating     And  also crafts   Sometimes building something  or putting something together really helps   I used to make candles and a friend of mine used to put small car models together   Can be a super fun distraction        Also  puzzles  Fun ones     Or  playing with a pet if you  or your neighbor's got one  There with you buddy  Had to work from 10am 10pm today at a major worldwide convenience chain store  First shift was fine because I had help  but it was slow anyways since everyone is still hungover or asleep  Once they left at 4  someone else was supposed to come in  and because it was so busy before they left  I figured i'd hold my excruciatingly painful shit I've now gotten from drinking milk a day away from spoling  No one came because "oh I'm not coming in anymore" happened and I can't lock the door to halt business        Not to mention my store was robbed a few weeks ago  with me being the victim  So a sketchy guy passes by the store a few times to peek in from across the street  only approaching if he "thinks" im in there alone  only to have a customer out of view talking to me     Now I have to worry about possibly getting robbed     again    Fast forward to the end of the shift  I finally get off and get home  only to fuck up the side of my car on the neighbor's car  There's still so much shit wrong with me just like everyone else like romance failures and blah blah blah  I'm at the point where any emotion brings a tear at this moment  Fuck this year already  It's been helpful for my depression  not a miracle but helpful   but the downside is my practictioner is convinced I'm bipolar now and dismisses any time I make her uncomfortable as "mania "  This is literally the only practitioner I've had in 13 years to react this way  she also doubts I have autism    and I am trying to change her but waiting lists are long    For 4 or 5 years  and we still are great friends   Would you like to talk to me  I won't go anywhere   It's funny i just realized  I never even look at the top or hot posts  Just go straight to new  She cares about you  Been spending NYE alone for a few years now and I hate December more than anything  There is too much happiness around for me to process  Been alone for my whole life so i can't imagine a life without being alone  I know the feeling to shut everyone so no one will constantly feel sorry for you   Hey happy new year   I don't have many friends at university either  but I personally prefer it that way  I am singularly focused on my studies and not beholden to anyone  I'm free in a way that most people aren't   I just feel like dying all the time now   It used to be every once in a while  but now it's been constant for weeks and I just don't have the drive to keep going Other then the strict relationship that comes with a patient to doctor sort of thing  I've given her no reason to   hugs   I can't really help you because I feel exactly the same  I pretty much categorically refuse to watch movies for this very reason  They're basically two hour commercials full of attractive people whose sole purpose in life is to make you feel like shit so you'll buy shit to dispel the feeling  The only TV shows that don't make me feel like an ugly loser are funny cartoons like Rick and Morty or Futurama   I'm sorry you feel similarly  I hope you can find peace  Wait I thought it is releasing in februari tho  Also you are in for some fun then I really like how zoom is introduced but I won't spoil anything    I'm glad to hear you two are still great friends  Did you take or break or anything after you had told her  Help comes in different forms  I think  I always got the sense that this place is more for peer support  for people to relate to one another rather than to receive platitudes from atop someone's high horse  I think a lot of people here aren't even depressed  but just come here to spew empty rhetoric about therapy so they can pat themselves on the back for trying to be helpful  But they really do more harm than good  I would expect better advice from you mate  Everything was working out  at least what I thought  now I am back at that point again  Whatever I do helps me temporarily then I am back to square one  I think I should just kill myself   We didn't talk about it for a few days  then we just got together  talked it through  and I said "I was over it too" when in reality I took 3 months getting over it  If I would've skipped those 3 months  I'd be much better off  In hindsight there's no reason I shouldn't have dropped it  except I was being selfish and wanted her   It also depends on her whether remaining friends will work out or not  Some people are cool with knowing someone likes them and others will feel awkward about it and avoid them Music for sure  Better than just letting yourself drift away from friends forever like me  Let them in Deleted mine a couple months ago  Glad to have that huge chunk of negativity gone  Too bad I can't "delete" all the bad shit in my head    I felt good for the first time in a while having 2 weeks off school for break and now I think I've crashed lower than I thought I was going to  I hate school so much  Its a main trigger of stress for me and it makes it so hard  You will push every single friend you have away if you keep doing this I can guarantee  They cannot help you  only you can do that for yourself  Have you thought of seeing a therapist   I also feel as if I'm the wrong sex  Like every day It's been a few days and we've spoken a few time since  I know it's early  but she didn't seem awkward during that time  I work 72 hours a week and go to school for another 18 because like you said I'm perfectly fine when I'm busy but I can't stand being alone with nothing to do and no one to talk to I'm 29 years old and I've been looking for "my people" all my life  I guess what that means is people who would have my back like I'd have theirs  that would accept me  and that wouldn't leave  I haven't found one  Maybe I'm in the wrong town but unfortunately it takes money to leave  I'm sort of finding those people on the internet  They aren't always the same people but they are people who get it and more often than not  those people are in this sub   Hopefully you find some of your people here too   Two days ago I ate one protein bar for the whole day  I literally forgot to eat and didn't feel hungry  and woke up super hungry  0 10 experience I get that  but she is one of my best friends so she knows I care about her  Thanks for the advice I'll definitely look into meetup com  I know you're not trying to put me down some things just need to be said a certain way  I just want to say your post inspired me to make an account and start posting here  Hopefully it helps me out some to get my thoughts out of my own head  Also  fuck your roommates and their sorry friends  At least you aren't them  getting pleasure out of meanness  Try meeting people online  safely of course  and chatting  I personally cope by daydreaming Hug Whoa  TIL I might have been autistic and bipolar the whole time  Yeah this used to happen to me a lot  I'm trying to reproduce  so I need to figure out what to do  It's almost unthinkable  how I'd manage it  When it happens  not if    Sorry I can't help  Just good to have someone to compare data with      My parents actually put me into a computer and addictions program at a mental health hospital  My counsellor has determined that my depression itself is obviously more of a priority than how I cope with it  Getting off the computer won't instantly cute me of being depressed  contrary to what my parents had hoped  10 years ago  I am 28  I was popular  outgoing   but almost all my friendships were superficial  Parties  etc     I only connected with maybe 2 people on a deeper level  Never had much in common even then except back then I partied and was extroverted  Yes  this  Bravo    OP  keep telling yourself things like this   "If I feel too sick at work I can always go home "  This is true  usually    "I think I'm going to hurl" usually makes a manager reconsider whether you should be at work  even in the shittiest low wage jobs    Every time I have done this  meaning  said this to myself  I have gone to work  then weirdly found myself able to stick it through  even when I thought there was no WAY I could  It is a surprisingly effective tactic   They also say when you are hung over  you should just get up instead of trying to rest  although every bone in your body is telling you you NEED to rest to recover    People say you should get up and go running  or whatever  Well fuck that    but getting up at all is enormously helpful  again  surprisingly   I didn't believe it  I was shocked  but pleased  by the results  I don't understand why  when you have poisoned yourself and need to rest like mad  getting up HELPS  But I swear it does   But you might have been talking about depression and getting out of bed   Well I have experienced both depression to the point of not being able to get out of bed  and hangovers to the same point  and similar advice holds true in both cases  weirdly   If I STAY in bed  whether from hangover  depression  or both  I think I'm going to "sleep myself better" but in fact it never fucking happens  So I have to admit   after years of this shit   that I am wrong  Please also go for a dental checkup  Even if you think your teeth might be fine they might not be and there may be tartar buildup which is easily removed as well as other problems  Once your dentist give you the green light you will have a fresh breath and smile you can be proud of  Well done on your achievement so far  Thanks  I always say I want to go back to my home planet  Idk if my people are on this one  I'm having those same feelings right now  While I'd like to keep in contact and hang out with her  It may be better for me to just take a break from our friendship  Hey mate  I understand the dreadful conflict between living in a life that most others would consider to be wonderful  and I'm sure it is wonderful for you  but still feel as though you're staring into the abyss  You seem like an intelligent and articulate person  so I'm sure you've realised the following  but I know the power of having someone tell you things that you already subconsciously know  Depression is not necessarily a reaction to things that are happening around us  but rather something that we are have  Certainly for myself I've found that after many years of trying to eradicate my depression I've realised it's something that simply needs to be managed   I understand how you and your wife may be drifting apart  similar things have happened with my relationships in the past  mostly because my partner couldn't understand why I claimed to be so happy with them and yet be so very depressed at the same time  It was too difficult to comprehend that quite often the happiest times I had coincided with my blackest moments  because I felt terrible guilt at being depressed even when things were going well    Does the loneliness really bother you  And are you more extroverted or introverted   And  dude  normal  What the hell is normal  If normal is having loads of people that you call 'friend' but probably wouldn't cross the road to save then I don't want to be normal  It's all semantics  The same goes for being better  You have to decide what those goals are  Being better and normal for me might be to make carpets out of my own hair  Is that what you're looking for      As for the suicidal thoughts   I've also had many  I still do   feel free to PM me if you want to know some of the darker thoughts I've had in this regard    I can't legitimately help with trying to avoid those  I know it's dramatic but you can always try  r SuicideWatch  A lot of the posts are pretty severe  but there are also lots of people there who will help   I know I'm not giving you any real solutions here mate  I just hope my response helps a little family problems personal problems Personally that is the reason why I have gravitated so much to depressing stories  If you want something good I would recommend a manga called Oyasumi Punpun  Its depressing as hell but for some weird reason it made me feel a little bit better inside  and reminded me that i'm not the only one trying to survive in a world that makes no sense  Thanks   I'd wait because I don't want to make a heat of the moment decision   I want to make sure I've been feeling this way consistently   I do sincerely want to get better  though I'm not always sure that's possible   I do want a meaningful reason to live   The issue is that what constitues a meaningful reason to live changes   When I'm in a depressive phase there might not be anything that really suffices   I might keep a log of my up down time to compare   There's still a chance things might get better  that I might be able to afford help  that I may overcome something   Even today I've been so despondant that I was crying and then fairly happy as I was talking to a friend   There's at least a few people who would be sad if I left  and I don't want to hurt them   I would just fake my death as an "accident" so as not to make them think  but there's a specific way I really want to go  if I decide to   I'd leave a video on a USB as my goodbye   Maybe a letter as well   It's not infrequent that I think of what I'd say   Anyway  aside from waiting for the life insurance clause to kick in  I want to give it at least a little while longer to continue to try and change course   I've held on for so long  I really don't want to go   But I need to do more than just hold on   That's the bear minimum  survival   I'd be "happy" even to be in a position like Dr  House  from the TV show   Brilliant  successful  able to do what he wants to  even if he is miserable    Only part of the way through  no spoilers please    I'd be satisfied to turn my coping mechanisms from depression  panic attacks and freezing up internally into depression and work ethic  I was thinking the same things a lot today  Just when will the bad stop  If nothing good is coming  when will the bad stop  I don't have any illusions that someone will come into my life and "save" me  I'm really doubtful that I have it in me to save myself at this point  I wish there was some bright point in the future to hope for  but it's not there   I'm sorry that you're going through what you're going through and dealing with someone who abuses you   It's nice to know that someone's  anyone really is  there to witness your thoughts   Amen  I can't believe I managed to get through it  I ended up with a few friends over for NYE   cheese was had  Then Jan 1  I had an asthma attack  Woo   Did you end up with YT or games   Crossword puzzles  I am still the only person I know to play Pokmon Go  Read  Sudoku  Puzzles  Look at pictures of puppies or kittens  whatever floats your boat    Just because it started out shitty doesn't mean it is going to end shitty  Screw the person that rejected you  You deserve better than that and it just means that something better is coming  I struggle with social interactions too and New Years is a whole bundle of awkward  I try really really hard to believe that something better has to come    Most times it takes some real work to keep thinking that way but it might help you get through the rough start to this new year    Edit    Rewording what I said   Welcome to Reddit  I appreciate your post  I do realize depression isn't circumstantial  it just makes it more frustrating cause you're right   I feel guilty  The loneliness does bother me   but I don't know why  I've never been quite as alone as I am right now  Not working  having no one to speak to daily  not leaving the house  I only interact with my dogs  I am introverted though  I don't even like people really  I guess I just feel so alone that I'm desperate  And by normal I mostly just mean I want to be able to work  run errands  bathe regularly  not cry all day   I feel for you man  I feel exactly like you feel  Happy new year  Cheers for making it through 2016   This is neither an overreaction  nor a waste of time  Never forget that  What you are thinking and feeling is important to someone   even if you don't know it   You seem to have started halfway through your story here my friend  when did you start to have these thoughts or reactions  Try to not get frustrated about not knowing why you feel a certain way though  it can be totally normal for negative thoughts to arise for no particular reason   I can try help you directly though  I'm a teacher and if you'd like me to proofread your college essays I'd be more than happy to do that for you  Maybe it is too hard to talk to your mom  I totally can relate but you should find someone to reach out to  It is hard to go through the lows alone and even having someone aware and checking in with you everyday or couple of days can be a big help   It could be a friend or cousin or teacher  You can't really be sure if that won't change within the next few days  But isn't it also great to know that she really likes you as a person  It might not help about the feeling of rejection but you gotta see the positive aspects  You no longer need to hide your feelings too Find hobbies  then go to clubs   Same here    I used to be but I no longer have the will or desire to do anything  Things I used to enjoy  soccer  hiking  snowboarding  photography  reading  writing  I'm afraid to try to make friends again though because I don't want to get my hopes up It's funny  I pretty much had the same conversation with a coworker recently  I'm a girl  he's a guy  I asked him out  We went on two dates but we didn't really mesh romantically like I thought we would  Things got awkward  We are not friends now either which is a shame  I feel like I ruined things  but I guess at least I know the truth   My computer is literally the first and last thing I see when I wake up and before I go to bed  That's depressing    I'm pretty sure I'm addicted  I almost wish my parents had never bought me a computer when I was 6  Agmatine   Sarcosine are very interesting to me because they both activate AMPA via mTOR like Ketamine  I wish we knew what mechanism causes Ketamine to be far more rapid in its anti depressive effects   I wanted to  but didn't get invited to anything  Even sent out a snap with weed  Eventually I just went to sleep since I had to work a long shift today  Nice  I like to temporarily deactivate when I'm extra down  and usually reactivate once I'm in an upswing I think this comes from expectations of some huge change that somehow "fixes" whatever is not how you want it to be  The crash is harder  Be good to yourself in any little way you can  Tomorrow is a new day  and so is the next   Good for you  I wiped clean my Instagram and Facebook accounts  not just deactivate  but actually delete every post and photo  and it was the best I'd felt in weeks   I get all my memes from my Instagram  I just follow meme accounts and nobody else  and I make sure nobody who knows me IRL can find me  Maybe you can give that a try  Rejection always sucks  Honestly there's millions of people in the world and some of us just aren't attracted to the people who are attracted to us unfortunately  It kind of makes me not trust myself or my judgement a bit when I like someone now  like there must be something off because I like them or that it would never have worked out anyway   But you should be proud of yourself  You told the truth   The other commenter was right though  If you truly have feelings for her  don't be her shoulder while she dates other people  You'll resent whoever she is with and perhaps come to resent her and you won't really be her true friend  And in that situation she will be either oblivious to your true feelings or lie to you to spare your feelings and not be a true friend to you   Take some time to let things cool off  Hopefully you can come out friends after   Glad to hear you are getting some help    I am a teacher in Sweden  as the school is not aware of your situation  including health staff at the school  I would strongly advise that you get them in the loop  Maybe you could simply approach a teacher that you trust and explain  Perhaps just go for a quick visit to the school nurse simply to inform them  They will likely ask if you could get a diagnosis  but that is not a priority straight away     The reason for this is that they will be able to support you in school  and if your grades slip then they will know why  Because you are under 18 you will get a help much more easily  and they will be able to make concessions for you so long as it supports you as a student   The best way to deal with depression  especially being so young  is to get as broad a support network as you can  The school may be able to help you with your parents perception of your issues as well  That's true I hope things don't change too much  It is which is why I wouldn't want things between us to become too awkward  Thanks for that I was completely missing that part of it  It does hurt like hell  but that weight is off my shoulders  Well on facebook I just turned off notifications for each single person I know  so I only see memes  Hate seeing other people's lives but can't give up on memes  that's why I did that   suggest other people to turn off notifications too for other people so the memes can still live     If you're in the US  check out your state's NAMI chapter   they're a great resource in general  and even if there isn't a support group in your area  they might have links to telecommute support groups  Social media just makes me feel worse  I'd rather not know anything that's going on  I don't think this is a place for the "normal people " as you call them  to come in on horseback and save the "helpless souls "  Rather  I think this is a place where people can relate to each other and support each other  or at least commiserate   But we shouldn't necessarily actively fuel each other's depression  which is what I see going on every now and then on this subreddit  get off all of it  its all dumb  its all a vain attempt to be important   After reading through your post  I really hope you can escape from your life and live however you want and wherever you want  It hurt my heart to see what you're going through   The guilt is a killer  I don't connect with very many people  and not much makes me 'happy'  but my last girlfriend did in so many ways  And it absolutely killed me to see her struggle to understand why I was so depressed while telling her I was the happiest I've ever been  I don't think there's an easy fix for that  I'm introverted too  and I prefer being alone  and even though sometimes I feel like that loneliness is oppressive  for the most part I enjoy it  But if you do need that human contact it's hard to find because speaking to loads of people or trying to connect with lots of people is just too exhausting for us  My only advice is to pick your battles  find someone  even if it means waiting  that experiences the world a little like you do and try and connect with them  I have to admit  I laughed out loud at 'bathe daily' because I've had the EXACT argument with someone before   What are you going to do today  Nothing  Can you at least fucking shower for once    For me it's routine  Routine routine routine  Once I get into a routine of doing things I do them regardless of how I feel  The difficult thing is to get started  but one you do the whole process becomes so rote that your feelings don't factor into it  Don't know if this will help you but whenever I think about these kinds of things I remind myself that the meaning of success isn't something that other people decide  Success isn't solely about money  nor is it about being in a relationship  Everyone has their own definition of Success  For me Success is finding someone who might be able to understand me  and being happy  If you don't know what you want that's fine  but just realize that you don't need to rush  just take it one step at a time   the obvious thing here is that your friends are just really mean or idk just INcorrect SMOKE POT DUDE   I'm sorry about that    Glad you were able to let him know though  It is a shitty feeling which I can totally empathize with especially now  I hope you feel better   I am not looking forward to finding a job after graduation  I am not looking forward to trying dating again  Both seem so daunting as I think of them   I was the person who couldn't live without fb but I got rid of it a while back  I think before Thanksgiving  I don't think I ever want to reactivate it either  The only regret I have is not getting a few phone numbers from certain people first but oh well life is so much better without all that bs   some people are reaching out and some people are bill boarding their problems just because  Most people don't know what they want  also  this is the internet     take that with a heavy chunk of digital salt  I no longer feel the need to play music and I was in bands my whole life  I feel your pain  My advice is get 100  off the internet and go travel and tell NOBODY about it   You don't have to compare you life to anyone else my friend  And you want to improve those specific things  Is there a reason for it  If not then why worry about them  I don't even know you  but you're clearly in pain  and you matter to me  So tell me  what are you interested in  I get what you're saying  I already set that boundary the last time we spoke and I'm going to be taking a break from her  Thanks for the advice  lol I can relate to this too   I feel tired all the time and just want to sleep     As a computer and internet addict myself I am torn between it and having a life  The computer is used as an escape  When I stop using it and stop using my phone and TV I literally don't know what do do with myself  I get bored and just patrol the house since sitting is boring and lying down I can only do for short periods since I can't sleep in the day  I know have 2 dogs that keep me entertained a bit but usually only to a point when I long to do something with myself   For many it may be a lifesaver however ultimately the computer TV drags me down further  It's like a lifeboat but with a hole in it  The computer TV locks my mind into a thought pattern that is not healthy since I am not aware and I am becoming less sentient  It's only when the eye fatigue kicks in and I am forced to stop using it due to the pain in my eyes  I then take a break but that only provides temporary relief as returning to my work or entertainment brings back the eye fatigue in minutes  A nights rest usually fixes it for a few hours  I have zero emotion left complete anhedonia and an very depressed  I am not suicidal though I don't see the point living like this either  During very bad spells I am unable to work and have to leave early or just stare all day at my screen  I fear I might lose my job as a result   The problem is that depression puts strain on the brain which is now very overworked from thinking  Bombarding it with flashing and changing TV content is allot for the brain to process not only while watching it but during your REM sleep and dreams as the brain tries to sort this backlog of information overload  That why depressed people sleep more and still feel tired all the time   The same applied to playing games  It's stressful on an overloaded overworked brain  And same for the internet  However the internet has other disadvantages  you can google your diseases sit on discussion forums or Reddit and get tons of misinformation or attempt to self diagnose which may make you worry more or increase emotion  I tend to google my meds and google alternatives to suggest and this has annoyed my psychiatrist as I come across as a know it all   But while the computer seems like a lifeboat since it's saving your life right now you cannot live in a lifeboat all your live  Eventually the lifeboat will sink as it is in my case  The solution is to make your rest of your life work  Since I have not been able to do that I can't advise on how  But people will generally recommend getting out more with friends and family  Exercising and getting out in nature  As well a following a healthy diet and addressing any shortcomings like Vit D or others and supplementing omega 3's  And getting a good nights sleep  Doing this as a depressed person seems like a mountain and it's hard or seemingly impossible to do all that at once   I was in a clinic once for 2 weeks where we were not allowed a computer or phone  We were giving access to the phone for one hour a day  There was a TV though I never watched it except for my last weekend  My eye fatigue significantly improved and I was forced to socialise and attend classes  Now it was probably a combination factor of the meds and the environment I was forced to make life changes including daily walks but at the end of 2 weeks I felt much better and ready to deal with life again  I tried to implement some of those changes in my everyday life but sadly within a month I started to relapse again  Thank you for this  it started happening in sophomore year I think  I will definitely take you up on that offer if I ever finish writing my essays All the time  Then when i stop responding to them they get all pissed off and act like its in my head Thank you  people suck  but it's ok to treat yourself    Hey  people are here for you my friend  Gonna send a longer message now  just want you to know I'm here  You've described almost exactly what I've been feeling  I always thought she found me attractive maybe I just have shitty timing  Thanks it was a relief to put it out there  As hard as it may be I won't be  I appreciate you taking the time to write this  it really helps  DOTA 2  Rocket League  Dont Starve Together Battle Block Theater  L4D 1 and   Portal 2  Payday 1     Add me on steam  http   steamcommunity com id    fadelreturns  Those high school animes where everyone has a ton of friends  several love interests  and goes out every day are especially depressing   I'm able to enjoy them for the escapism but I get deeply depressed when I'm done watching    I like stuff with relatable characters who have depression anxiety like NGE and Watamote    If you believe stereotypes  American girls will like you because you're tall and you have an accent   If you have acne  it could be hormones and could go away  The weight thing  you could go to the gym or run or walk and do push ups and lose the weight or turn it into muscle mass  I don't see it happening if you don't even have the motivation to brush your teeth   I'm honestly not trying to be rude there  I only brushed my teeth today because I had to go to work    I too have gone to sleep after 5 am and woken up at 4 pm  I will say that going to the gym really helped me sleep at regular times  Well I fall asleep before the sun comes up anyway   I hope you find something that helps you  I'm still working on it clearly   If you have a friend that you feel you can trust  try and open up to them  It's scary but you'll have someone to talk to  Don't do the Facebook thing  It probably won't make you feel better  Honestly it's terrifying to me to imagine telling all my friends about how depressed I am   You are normal if you have a wife  Isn't it nice to know they want to see you at least  Makes me feel good  First off  You're not alone   in any regard  I've had suicidal thoughts for many years  some darker than others  and I've even hurt myself pretty bad  And through all those experiences I've learned that there are always people that will be there to try and help  Not fix   sometimes that's impossible   but always help  I think it's important for you to see a therapist  you need to try and find the root of these thoughts and treat them  If you focus on the depression surrounding the thoughts you never actually get to the point of preventing them  There is also  r SuicideWatch  loads of people there who have been through similar experiences and are willing to offer their help and support  But keep speaking to us if you want  we're all here for you  I feel you man  Nobody believe I have anxiety or depression even though I've seen therapists in the past and have been diagnosed  I'm going through some stuff myself  but nobody hates you anxiety is a bitch like that  I used to have those bouts of numbness  What helped me is trying to take a moment to let me feel what's going on so that things don't build up  Hang in there man  God I know how you feel    That really sucks  I'm envious you're still in contact with people you've known since you were 5  That's amazing  Is there any part of your friendship with them that you still enjoy  Also depression can mean different things to different people  Some people may only be depressed for a few months  others may have been for their whole life  That doesnt really help  Trust me That sucks  People are so unreliable when it comes to going out I swear   It's truly not fun Facebook and snapchat kinda suck  they just make you feel worse  I'm still on instagram though cause on instagram there are so many accounts dedicated to mental health and they make me feel better in a way Depends  Events can cause depression  If you lose your SO  job and all your friends it could it you into a long term depression  Stop watching mainstream hollywood crap and watch arthouse films  There are so many amazing movies out there     I hate when that's what people say when you admit you want to die  that it's selfish  It's the most unhelpful shit  Please think of me and how I'd feel if you died feels more like a guilt trip than someone inviting you to stay and welcoming you to stay alive  It sucks that your friends weren't understanding considering they know where you're coming from  Maybe they're pissed because they know where you're coming from or because they don't know what to do for you   I hope you guys make up soon   I'm sorry I didn't reply until now  I don't typically use this account  I'm not saying it's fine to stop exercising  just that the joy you can get from it is counteracted by the anxiety  about your appearance or performance   in my opinion  I can relate completely  the internet  watching movies  playing games  anything that can be traced back to the net is my only relief  I went two weeks without the net a couple years ago and without I had a total mental breakdown  I stayed with my best mate the entire time cause he wanted to keep an eye on me and be there for me when I needed someone  But  without the net to distract from the world and my own thoughts I just completely fall apart  Not one single member of my family understands and that leads to stupid arguments  You are definitely right though  it should be listed as a legitimate source of relief for people suffering from depression  Addiction or not  the net is still the better option   I don't think most people really want to hear a true answer  When I was at school  I was taught the correct greeting was "Hello  How are you" "I'm Good  how are you" "I'm good too" That's the best reason to go      Also  sorry I'm not replying until now  Your roommates are fucking arseholes  Reading your post makes me want to throat punch them  although probably don't do that   Is there something you like to do  Favourite food  A walk around your city town  A massage  A movie  Happy birthday x I completely agree  and want to add that I think the majority of people  do  get over it  because depression changes along with life  But most come here when they're feeling sad  and visit other places when they're happy   at least in my case  That's why I've begun going to  r wholesomememes  using my main account   and I've actually started feeling better     Oh wow dude  what a turbulent time of your life  There's so much going on mentally physically socially   If you suffer from some form of depression then everything is going to be all the harder for you  I don't know you personally  but I know high school students  so maybe some of this applies to you but maybe not  I know that at your age you have a load of things going on outside of school   friendships  relationships  etc   and we seldom realise it but they drain a load of our energy  We have to direct our attention to so many different people we can't help but be exhausted  If you're extroverted that gives you a high  If you're introverted  like me  you fall into the void after a day of social interaction  So which ever you are  even before your job sport academics  you're mentally drained  And then of course you have everything else in your life  Including parents  who can really suck sometimes  I'm not suggesting in the least bit that you cut anything from your life  but pay close attention to how each of them make you feel  I'll use myself as an example here  I'd look at my life  realise that all the time I spent trying to socialise was tearing me apart because I just can't really connect with people and it was hurting me  It doesn't mean I'd cut that from my life  and at school that something you can't really do  but I'd try to manage it better  You see what I'm getting at   And if you want I'll look at your unfinished essays  Maybe I can give you some notes that will encourage you to complete them  This is such a tough question for me  I don't want to feel embarrassed for truly saying how I feel  I'm lying if I say I'm fine  Cuz deep down I'm struggling and I just feel so hopeless that I can't find away out of this hole that I'm digging deeper and deeper  Life's confusing    I always think of W B Yeats and how much he despised 'polite  meaningless words '  When I'm in a cavalier mood and someone asks me how I am I'll cheerfully say  'I'm good thanks  haven't cut myself once today ' Very true  I always just go for the generic enthusiastic 'Good  How 'bout you ' or something  I've noticed recently that I'm starting to sound more flat when I say it  even if I intend for it to sound peppy and lighthearted   This isn't silly at all  You're feeling something extreme and you shouldn't hide that  What's your favourite film tv show book graphic novel  The best thing about this sub I feel  is the fact that there is always someone with something similar going on  someone to say  "hey  i legitimately understand how you're feeling  know what you're talking about " And that small connection can sometimes be the thing to make you keep going You'll do fine  Rooting for you m8 Hows much does it cost if may ask  I feel like you read my mind and posted how I always feel  I relate to this so much   good luck dude  deep breaths and keep calm  depression and anxiety  Ain't nobody got time for that   HUGGGGGS  What's up  You can dm me if you want  There have been studies done  there's a direct correlation  no one here cares about your humblebrag What's going on  I'm more than happy to talk  using whatever method you like I'm also 6'5  I could give you the perfect height hug  Can you get to South Africa  thank you for your wishes  D I appreciate your existence  3 I'm gonna do this  Thanks for the tip  Probably not anytime soo lol I wish I had cancer because it would give me an excuse to take a break from work and be miserable in bed like I already am  I've seen beautiful happy people get cancer and I can't help but think  why them  It could be someone who wastes their life away being depressed like me  They shouldn't have to deal with it when there's people like me who deserve it more  Really  I will try to find it  I deleted my account that I already never used 3 or 4 years ago  I had to create another one months ago for a school project and I only used it once or twice  I now have an empty account with like 4 or 5 friends   I can't pretend to know what you're going through  it seems like you've had to deal with a hell of a lot in a very short amount of time  I think it's going to be so important for you to find support  Not just friends and family but some therapeutic support  If it's enough to speak to people here then that's great but I think some professional practitioners are a really strong option  But you're not alone  In many respects you're not alone   i stay on instagram too  i never use snapchat either  People are more than ignorant and rude honestly they forgot what respect means I fully agree with you  right  i wish i got rid of it sooner  lmao i remember staying up all night before my birthday bc i was worried no one on FB would remember  i was such an addict  i feel wayy better tho   I come here to read people's venting when I'm at my worst  That helps me get through these nights  So it is definitely something  innit Sometimes life's problems are the best motivators  Keep you head up buddy and look to the future with hope and ambition   I had a "friend" that would do this   I would text or IM them and unless it was something that they had an investment in  or benefited them directly  they just wouldn't respond   So  I deleted their number  deleted their contact and haven't been on any IM service in 6 months   So far they haven't noticed I haven't contacted them at all   So   yea   Guess I wasn't that important to them  hahaha thats pretty smart bro   i think ima just subscribe to every decent meme subreddit cos im staying the fuck away from FB   yup im staying on insta  recommend any good meme accounts on there  lol  I know it's hard feeling like you cannot trust others  but all it takes is one good friend to forget about all the bad ones   If sarcosine's mechanism is primarily through glycine transport inhibition resulting in glycine induced potentiation of AMPA receptor function  it's probably slow for analogous reasons to SSRIs  no   Maybe a strong glycine releasing agent  if such a thing is possible  would be more like MDMA instead of an SSRI in speed of antidepressant onset   https   www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles PMC5069295  i wish there was a deactivate button on my feelings but nah cuz Hey  i was thinking that   but if it was just for memes n shit i dont think id use it anyway lol  Well said What does upregulate AMPAR mean exactly  Increase the amount of AMPAR receptors  How does sarcosine and lamictal do this   l theanine is ampar antagonist  and nmdar agonist  Would it be helpful synergistic with sarcosine lamictal or hurtful  Moving is a tough transition  Your depression may be caused because you are leaving your comfort zone and fighting the move  Try seeing things differently  Mel can I do that when I have 0 friends I can trust anymore  If you don't find out how to do it just ask me in pm  just whenever you see anyone you don't want to see pop up on facebook  press that triangle thingy for a drop down menu and then click tap on "hide all posts from   " good luck     I hate being asked that question too and always feel like I am lying when I say "good "  Eventually  you will see a day when you say "good" and actually mean it    Live for that day   in the subreddit  r getdisciplined  some wrote recently that all of this discipline advice boils down to 2 steps   1  Write down a Plan  2  Do it   So what's your plan s   Have you written them down  Posted them on a wall somewhere so you can check on them everyday  If you have a big plan  have you broken that plan down into smaller chunks   2011  2012  and 2013 were years of failure for me  3 years in a row  Just like you  Except that they weren't complete total fails  Nothing ever is a complete failure  It's only a failure if you fail to learn    In 2012  I made a 1 year and 5 year plan  I wrote down the biggest  grandest dreams that I thought would make me happy   Most of the things on my 1 year plan  I did not meet in 1 year  but after 3 years  I had actually accomplished most of them  Things that I didn't succeed at were either not really in my control  eg  Get married  or not concrete enough  eg  Invent stuff   Regarding your poor diet  one of the easiest things you can do is start drinking only water  Cut out all soda  juice  alcohol  coffee with cream and sugar  etc  I happen to like seltzer water a lot  It does 2 things for you  It drastically cuts down on a source of empty sugar calories and it keeps your palate clean of lingering flavors that tell you to go get another helping of whatever it was you were eating   Find a way to build exercise into your life 5 days a week  For me it was bike riding  I ride my bike everywhere  Automatic exercise  I always feel better on days that I ride   A friend of mine does yoga every day  It's part of her life  Another friend of mine works from home and takes a break every day by walking down to the corner store for a diet coke  The corner store is 10 minute walk away  20 minutes of walking every day for him  Build unavoidable exercise into your life  Also  get over to  r loseit if you want help with your weight    It's greedy of who  Thank you friend  Saying out loud can sometimes be the hardest part indeed  Thank you    trust me i did that on sooo many people lol I have like 20 friends on there and only recently started using it again for the depression and social anxiety support groups   There are lots of people here who understand  Myself included  You aren't alone  I have the same thoughts and I fight them everyday  We just have to push ourselves harder than everyone else because they have it easy   thanks for the support guys but there are also things that I didnt mention in the original statement  i pretty much had everything that any high school guy wants but now its all gone  friends  girlfriends  everything   Some I follow that I like  braving  onthebookshelf  satansstarbucks  friedfluff  kttiens  owlturdcomix  Keep in mind that the more you follow  the more reposted memes you see  so you might have to shop around Yeah I have been thinking of finding some sort of therapeutic support for a while now but I don't even know where to start  and therapy is looked down on in my family so I'd be alone on that one  But I do agree with you and thank you  Then message boards like this will probably be the best start for you  there will always be people here to help  And I'm sure you are going to be strong for your family  no matter how broken you may feel  It takes a lot to be as open and vulnerable as you have been here  so I'm sure that bravery translates into your everyday life too  Manic depressive introvert gamer teacher here   you're gonnna be fine bud  try to focus on one thing at a time and work methodically  If you need someone to chat to about personal issues then get in touch but I'll also help you out with study skills and exam prep if you want  Good luck mate thank you I will seek help when needed  I try to be as brave as I possibly can for my family  Sadly this is the only way I feel safe expressing what I truly feel  The way I see it is I can't unload on my family or friends because it would probably be to much on some and others truly just don't care or at least don't care about me  But it is nice to know there are people in this world who care enough to talk to a stranger and help them out  If there is one thing I have learned  it's that depression isn't logical If it was such a serious concern then you must have been very strong through the year  I'm proud of you too  fuck you  You have fucking idea   Oh sorry  I should've posted it in the first place  Here    http   waitbutwhy com 2014 06 taming mammoth let peoples opinions run life html  I can't trust hope again  I was deceived too often  I  was  looking around for a reason to live  Or to get the will to get better  It's a prestep if anything but I keep sabotaging and hindering myself even there    I'll look into the philosophy  thank you    Nothing that we do in this life is a waste   I can't see it this way  I pour my time down the gully  If others knew      It's not just my free time  It's what I studied  It's the job I have that's so pointless like I'm stuck in a Kafka novel  Looking for another one won't change much   At the moment not even art or music or literature that I create has any meaning anymore  The things that are truly meaningful in life in my eyes are valuable experiences and friendships  And I can't have either of them    I won't be able to forgive myself  or ever truly accept the past  i know I'll still have breakdowns and it's going to be a struggle to climb back up out of this hole but the thing is   I had so many desperate and dark moments the last months  And almost the worst thing about it is hearing "you just see it through black glasses  it's not that bad  it's not the truth"  But it is  This is fragile enough as it is  I don't need anyone else to pretend that it simply doesn't exist or it's just an ill brain making those things up    Some mornings I woke up and felt like I didn't have any problems at all  This is not a good state  It's not a free or happy state either  All my problems still did exist  I just couldn't remember them  This state was nothing but a whim of my body  brought by whatever hormonal changes  I neither can trust nor rely on those    When it became too bad I managed to do something else  I eventually managed to mentally push my problems aside  I knew they existed  I didn't ignore them and I didn't suppress them  Suppressing them would insinuate that I would think they don't exist  It was like taking a break from myself  Very fragile but it helped for the moment     Learn from your past to not continue doing the same bad habbits   I can't  This is the third time in my life that I think that I wasted my life  This means that everything I did since the last two times was pointless  If I stop doing one thing it searches itself another outlet  I don't know what's worse  walking into catastrophes with open eyes and fully knowing that ones actions are horrible or living obliviously  dishonestly and in a state of lying to oneself for years without noticing it  I did both    No one says you need to accept your wrongs but you do need to know them to not do them   Therapist says it  There is probably no other choice  And it sucks so much   Thanks for your answer as well  H is for happy U is for you G is for good   Mix it up around and "You  good happy"  Look  I haven't had such an experience  but I know the way you feel about yourself  I know how it feels to feel that everyone would be better without me  or even if I wasn't born at all  All I do is give shit to everyone silently  so anyone notices how shit I'm inside  or pretend I think something when I really don't   All of what happened in my life feels my fault and that I was useless or even the cause of it  But I feel yours is different       If you would like to talk  DM me  whenever you want  I don't even acknowledge the new year anymore  People getting all happy and drunk over one year ending and another beginning  Why  A lot of people out there put on a different face and pretend thing's are better  But  the truth is harsh so it's ignored  People with depression don't have a choice  I went to bed and forced myself to sleep before my mind started running like it always does  I've been told "you get depressed on new years cause you don't want to do anything " No  I actually would like to do something but depression is one hell of a brick wall to knock down  I've been dealing with depression for about 25 years  what have I learned from all those years of pain and suffering   The New Year is full of shit  If you want memes  reddit is the main source    Deleting fb was one of my first steps towards recovery from depression This year no one will remember when my birthday is because I won't havery fb to remind them but I know all theirs because I'm not a total ass hole and asked em and wrote that shit down in my calendar so I can still tell them happy birthday  I bet this year maybe two people will remember my birthday  God  Fb makes people so god damn lazy too  It was such a huge wake up those first few days when up realized just how much free time I had after I deactivated it  I can get so much more shit done now    I don't    but I CAN if I choose to  LOL   Im just staring at this text box trying to figure out what to say  Im so fucking empty   some people are getting used to just saying "I'm fine" Good  You won't miss it Your comment seemed lonely here  Allow me to accompany you   hugs  I see plenty of people trying to help here   And if there is a thread about one person feeling better the vast majority of comments are cheering for OP and wishing him her luck   Sadly there are also people who aren't able to grant other people some small pieces of sunlight   Looks like they could've stopped at NEWS and after that they padded it out somewhat I have  for complicated reasons  some memories about Seattle that I'd rather not rip up  I've never noticed the city in movies and shows  but somehow the last three shows I've watched were all set there  Just seeing it mentioned burns a hole in my chest  Just a heads up in case you didn't know if you are on any SSRI's maybe talk to your doctor about taking St John's Wort   Hey man  I don't know much about body building  but if you are thinking of setting up a home studio you can teach yourself a lot via YouTube  Maybe even invest in some mirrors too so you can check your form  If you only care about memes  Twitter is a thing Meetup com has a bipolar support group in my area  try it for yours   I attended once  before my work schedule changed   Six or seven others with bp1 or bp2    I'm 18  And I see what you mean   Thats why I watch depressing movies  You should maybe call that number  We're creepy similar  I have a psych degree and struggled silently with SAD for years as well  I feel like maybe the training makes you feel like you should be able to handle it alone  I ended up in a similar situation to you   close brush with a lethal act  and thought alright  do I call that damn number  it's so useful to have a simple act to do instead of committing the    other act  or do I do this  And I called   So I basically entered a system from that point on where they wouldn't let me not check in with them  They didn't take me into supervised care or anything  but I was required to stay in contact and I basically gave them permission to rock up on my doorstep if I didn't call or turn up to the emergency appointment  Surprised the shit out of me the first time I flaked out  I don't know if they saved my life  but definitely playing along with the system I was scooped up by helped me back onto my feet and into a successful life   Sigh    I'm off my meds for the first time in six months and already I'm back on this forum  I dunno what this urge to quit them is  They say you're supposed to  but every time I try  here I am again   r wholesomememes You don't own her   I had something kind of similar happen a while ago  Texted someone I hadn't talked to for a while a longass status update  didn't get a reply for weeks  I eventually asked her a short "are you okay" type question  Turns out she'd wanted to make sure she'd write a proper reply to my longass text  not just a "k"  and wasn't really sure what exactly to write  and kept putting it off  and then it had taken so much time that replying now would be awkward so she'd have to explain that  and then she kept putting THAT off  and on the whole it was basically the most relatable thing ever   I was without facebook pretty much until 2 3 years ago  and only now use it for practical stuff  like quickly getting a hold of someone  I avoid looking at other people's pages  especially people I know  it will ONLY cause sadness  And winning even in a small ordeal is very rewarding   Rinse with something that kills germs after you brush  Saline solution  dissolve salt in warm water until you can't get any more salt to dissolve   mouthwash containing alcohol  or VERY DILUTE antiseptic  might be instructions on the bottle   are good ideas  Gum infections make your gums tender  and the brush can open little cuts which you need to clean   just like you'd clean any other wound  You can also try flossing after that  and then rinsing again  for proper clean  I'm putting off going to the dentist too  and if I'm strict about this  my gums stop being sore and getting cut so easily  I know what that's like  not being able to talk to someone in your life and not wanting to burden them  I was singing in a youth choir several years ago and I made friends much younger than I  Eventually I left because I felt it was unfair for them to listen to and deal with all my adult baggage  However  despite my thinking that  some of them got back in touch and we're pretty close  Did that 2 years ago and it's empowering in the fact that nobody knows anything about me or my personal life at all  especially after passage of 2 years       But it's impossible to network  degree of issue that this poses is very dependent on age    Either way  not going back and don't mind being really excluded from popular culture in this form   While my mental health remains far from heathy normal      I know FB is not something I can have  Codecademy makes it really simple  Doesn't provide a lot of advice on how to actually get started building stuff  but if you learn Python  you can go to the Django  a Python web framework  website and follow the tutorials there  which actually guide you through building a site of your own using Python  Then you can modify that  I can relate  One thing I am trying out is called mindfulness  My favorite book is called  wherever you go there you are  You can easily find the audio on YouTube  I highly recommend it  Please get back to me for an update    27 year old here  I've been out of my rapid cycling phase and unmedicated for about 3 years now  and I have got to be honest with you  you probably don't want friends with mental illnesses all that much  I was an absolute horror show to deal with at times in my early 20s  Like you said you want friends who understand the complexity of mental illness  in my experience most reasonable people can get a grasp of what's going on if you explain calmly    The key is that your diagnosis is an explanation for your manic or depressed moods and the problems that come with them  Your diagnosis is not an excuse for that behavior  When you find friends who understand that  support you  and call you out on your shit I think you'll do fine  Don't hesitate to tell people what's going on   That IS AWESOME  Dude  The Gregorian calendar is  Yeah  I have like four people I still follow lol  Eeeegh  I still get urges to delete it  Occasionally people from school get in touch though  and I'd basically lose touch without that  It sucks that you have to keep something that makes you unhappy  I'd much rather someone just keep a list of email addresses    Hi there and welcome  First of all a big pat on the back for the running I really hope it helps   I think you have thought through your options pretty well so I will try to add a bit more meat to those bones   You don't need a lot of equipment to work out at home  Take a look at  r bodyweightfitness and their recommended routine  I work out at home myself  All the equipment I have is a kettlebell  a sandbag  a suspension trainer  a weighted vest and a slosh tube  You are right though that starting lifting without someone to show you the ropes is potentially dangerous either in the short term throw your back out lifting too much scenario or the long term muscle imbalances scenario  I just did a quick google and I am surprised that there are not more 24 7 gyms in West London  Most gyms do open up around 6 6 30am  Thats the time I used to go to the gym  Normally at that time of day there are only a few people there who quite often don't want any social contact either  Having said that normally people in gyms are as friendly and supportive as you can get  Likewise if you want to be left alone just jam your headphones on and people get the message   I did another quick google and there are a few personal trainers in West London that kind of specialise in clients with mental health problems  This could be a gold mine for you perhaps    who knows  I would think its got to be worth a try at the least   Best of luck  let us know how you get on  I am sure your experiences will benefit lots of other people  I care  I'm here for you  You're not alone You don't have to deal with it alone  You have the community here  and as much as I hate to say it  professional help might be a good idea  They will give you tools to help deal with it I like Mr Robot  or the first season of True Detective  I guess I have a thing for tortured characters   I've been struggling with suicidal thoughts too  It's a hell of a fight  But please know that you're not alone in fighting for that  If there is anything you need or just want to talk  shoot a pm  I may not have the best advice but I'm all here to listen  Happy New Year x Long distance is so hard  Especially when one person is off having new experiences  it's always worst for the person "left behind"   She shouldn't have told you she is sick of you being insecure  it's not your fault  If you've been together 1 5 years  you need to talk to her about how she is making you feel  It won't feel right if she comes back and just tries to have things go back to the way they were Wow that really  really sucks  Dude I think you happened to get a couple of shitty people because the 2 times I've called suicide hotlines the kind stranger on the other end literally saved my life   oh wow  that's a shitty thing to happen     are you ok  There's plenty of people on here who can relate to you  you can rage or vent or just get shit off your chest  The sub is always here    That's pretty cool  I'm sure I'll figure something out eventually  Thank you for talking with me it has really helped  The people on the other end just see this as a job  They don't realize their importance and by that matter are complete assholes    You're not worthless  the idiots just didn't care  And they wouldn't have cared if you were anyone else in the world  So no  they are wrong  not you As a depressed person  I've had some similar thoughts about the "wallowing" criticism and such    Maybe I am wallowing  I don't know  But it helps to see how others talk about and respond to things that I also deal with  Some thoughts are quite striking or resonating  Maybe that's why   r raisedbynarcissists maybe From reading this post I would say you sound like there is still life and energy inside you   Take it from someone who's been on this shitty carnival ride for over 15 years  get out and find happiness while that spark is inside you  Don't get to be my age and realise the time has passed  and all you got left is to wake up the next day  and the next  and so on and so forth til you eventually die or take your own life   Sounds like you got a journey to go on   Best of luck  No worries mate  all the best    Hmmm  well for me going to sleep is one step closer to waking up and dealing with tomorrow  It's gonna be a long night     Best of luck friend  I'm here for you  Send me a message any time  You're not alone when you have this community of like minded folk  Helplessness is pretty common after this kind of thing  especially when you are the dumpee  It will improve for you  especially with time  It may not feel like it right now but a new boy will come along and knock your socks off  I'm so glad that you stopped and that you're still with us  Don't let the list of things you want to do empty  keep adding things to the list  but like your title says  you're alive  If you're still underage  your parents knowing is a good thing  They're there to support you  Actually   They aren't  They think my depression is something I made up to act badly   For example  saying I do not want to argue over my bedroom'd situation   Hopefully when your parents have time with the psychologist they may change their viewpoint  Another adult confirming what you are telling them Yeah  I enjoy the celebrations of new year  the fireworks and such  But then it just comes back to feeling as bad as before  i have now stopped sharing anything with her  coz whenever I discuss my feelings  she makes it about herself and says how unlucky she is that she is stuck with me and sort     So  with no interest or motivation left in life and no support  I am just waiting for the day my mind will give up and i'll pass on from this world  Don't ask yourself 'why ' Depression never makes sense  I stopped asking why a long time ago  maybe just try to focus on getting through the rough bits than the why  it helps me sometimes  Although I didn't deleted facebook  its synces my address book   I have stopped using it myself  and it is a big relief  Having a CDL gets you great work that lets you venture out  explore the world  make new memories  Great idea to get one  Kick this year's butt  You are skilled  you are talented   this is your time to shine    I believe in you Don't live with such horrible people  that will help a bit    i will everyday man  thanks for responding it means alot I'm really  really glad you didn't   You are welcome  TIL that you actually sound "right" to yourself through a record than normally speaking  No wonder people hate me   I want to stop talking entirely  Thank you  if that can be considered a compliment  So what's your story  I mean how come you're on this subreddit  yeah i wish emailing eachother was still a thing  i remember my old friend and i would send eachother these ugly emails drowned in neon coloured bold fonts hahah  she's now FB addicted so we never talk      you don't needa keep something that makes you sad  are those occasional "hello"'s from your friends worth being unhappy    hugs  I'm so sorry you're going through such a rough time   yeahhh no one's gonna remember my birthday this year but im fine with that  and LMAO  not all heroes wear capes  thnks dude why  Whenever I was old enough to understand death  I balled my eyes of frequently  I knew my parents were a lot older than me  and that they would probably die before I did  That was my biggest fear at your daughter's age   I'm going to take a quote from The Office  "Fear plays an interesting role in our lives  How dare we let it motivate us  How dare we let it into our decision making  into our livelihoods  into our relationships "  S8E5   My biggest fear now is not being happy for the rest of my life  Sure I'll be happy sometimes  but I want to figure out my formula to get the most out of it  Well she is not wrong  I would have picked her up  But breaking up for this is a bit too much  Maybe she will come back  break ups are not always permanent   It sounds like your sister's words really hit you hard and I'm sorry you had to hear that  Even if she doesn't care what happens to you  I do care  And from what I can tell  you are already putting in your best effort to cope with your depression and retain a semblance of a life  It's a pity she doesn't see that    hugs  I know  It's awesome  Many people may find this subreddit very useful and supportive  but might not know about it  Hooray   hugs   I can very much relate to this  She left at some point  probably a while ago  I still remember the scent of her hair  the way her hand felt in mine  her head against my chest when we embraced for the last time    I don't know where she is  And I'm terrified of forgetting  Completely understand how you feel  23 F from Australia and I find I'm only content when I'm around people  I was dumped yesterday and have found myself too sitting at home wondering why I can't be happy when I'm by myself  The situation obviously doesn't help  but it's very hard to distract yourself when you're alone  I'm not sure exactly what it is  but I too haven't learnt how to be happy alone  I guess we're both here for the same reason  That's one decision I've made that I'm very happy with  Did it about 5 years ago and do not miss it  I know it's criticized as being "edgy" to philosophize about the damage of social media  but I honestly think it's a big part of what seems so different about people these days  Everybody seems so self centered and selfish and I guess that's bound to happen when multiple times a day you're figuring out what picture or information to post online and have your ego stroked  And yes  not having to look at the curated and edited version of everyone else's life that they put forward is a nice benefit  But then it's also depressing knowing I'll probably never meet someone who isn't pulling out their phone every 5 minutes to check social media   I'm so sorry  Sometimes people truly suck  I've basically ignored that question my entire life  I consider a gesture like a wave or saying hi more than it's an actual question  Always just answer it with "fine" and move on  I actually find it gross any time someone actually takes the opportunity to say "I'm great " and then ramble on about some awesome thing that just happened to them    If I had just won a million dollars and somebody asked me how I'm doing I would just say fine   Yes  I live in Texas   I will go take a look at this immediately  thank you for the resource  Escapism is the way to cope with things  I think that most of people really deep inside know how things truly are but are too busy to think about it  It's when we are alone that we get darker thoughts are are our true selves   damn  all i gotta say to that is AMEN Not really  It wasn't even till the next day   Only within minutes or hours  I feel horrible again  It sucks to care for someone so much only to be forgotten I'm so sorry that happened  A loss like that is never easy to deal with and you must be in so much pain right now  It does take a lot of time  and perhaps therapy sessions  to get over the feeling of having lost everything  but I urge you to reach out to people IRL  even if you haven't spoken to them in a while  and find an outlet for the kinds of feelings you're having  even if it's just screaming and hitting pillows  Eventually his leaving you will no longer be about losing your entire world  but rather just a miniscule part of it  I'm rooting for you  Take care   It's always hard to judge when you notice something like this about yourself whether it's just the way you are or hints at something that could use some adjusting  You just don't want to end up being someone who constantly has to chase after some sort of companionship because you can't stand to spend an evening alone  I know one or two people like that who get off of work at the end of the day and then their sole mission in life is just to run through their contact list one by one and figure out who is available to distract them that night  And I'm not assigning this behavior to them  they've flat out admitted they can't stand to be alone  Life would seem pretty exhausting if you constantly have to be in pursuit of some sort of distraction and live in fear that you're gonna find a gap in your calendar where you have to spend some time by yourself  And it's insulting being friends with that type of person when you know the invitation to hang out on certain days just means they got that far down in the contact list and decided to ask you    I guess it more so hinges on if it's just the fact that you're alone that brings about the depression  or if you're depressed or have other things on your mind that finally come out when you find yourself alone  If it's solely that the being alone itself is what rubs you the wrong way  that's not good  You should be able to enjoy some alone time  If it's that other fears and doubts creep out when there isn't something to distract your senses  then you have to try to figure out what that might be   Time is the only solution that really helps  but it is important to know that you WILL get through this  It helps to surround yourself with family or a hobby you really like  focus on something that interests you  get your mind off things and keep yourself busy  After some time goes by you will find yourself thinking of him less and less until one day  he never crosses your mind    3  a big warm hug   Yeah  I loved her  even though I also accepted that we would always be just friends  The last time I saw her I'd told her I wanted to be around for her more from now on  But I don't think I'll have the chance to now  It sounds like you have places to go and meanings to seek  I'm excited for you  My first reaction was to start typing and say of course this is creepy and unhealthy  But there's one thing that comes before anyone else's opinion  and that is whether or not you are okay with this  If you know deep down that you want a real committed future with someone and not some half measure where they can't marry you because of their mommy  then no  of course this is not okay  On the other hand  if the official title or status of the relationship doesn't matter much to you and you're happy existing in a situation that is pretty much a dead end while you maybe keep your eye out for other opportunities  nobody else has the right to tell you whether that's okay or not   Based on what you wrote I'd have to assume this is of course not the situation you wanted otherwise you wouldn't be here asking about it    He's 28  Of course anyone would be hurt by hearing their parent make a threat of suicide or something like that  but at the end of the day his mother is of the previous generation and he has his own life to live and should understand that he has to think about his own future and not throw away opportunities in his own life because his mother made threats    I think there's one strong possibility here that you may not like to confront  Rather than seeing this as his manipulative mother coming in and messing things up and tearing him away from you  you have to consider that if he gave up the fight that easily that he must not have been too concerned about having a real future with you or taking this relationship to the point of full commitment  I can tell you right now if I deeply loved someone  even my own family trying to come between us and manipulate me with some silly threats wouldn't be enough that suddenly I'm willing to distance myself from that person  So don't do him the favor of acting like he's an equal victim of circumstance here and that you've both had your future taken away because of her  He wouldn't be going along with her demands if he valued having a real future with you  In the end this gives you a clear window into how much he was concerned about you and having that future together  and it doesn't seem like much  No man who loves you could be taken away from you by his mother  That's his problem to live with and maybe some day in the future come to realize how foolish he was that he made that more important than you  But don't look at this like it's the circumstances keeping him from you  He's allowing himself to be kept from you    If you wanted more than some relationship that can never be anything official  then of course it is unhealthy to put aside what you know is right for you and try to go along with it  Of course this all depends on what is causing the problem in a relationship  if you were here saying you want a man who can provide you all the money and riches in the world and you're not sure if you can settle  it might be different to try to tell you that you're hung up on all the wrong things and you should be able to love the person anyway  But this situation is not like that  It's an an unhealthy desire to actually want to have a full  admitted future with someone and not have to treat it like some dirty secret that can't be talked about    And if he's actually saying he'd go along with it if his mom finally sound some other person that she'd approve of him marrying  then hell no there's no reason for you to stay in this  What are you gonna do  spend years of your life as his companion until the mother finally "hires" him a wife and then you get left in the dust   It's over  A 28 year old man just let his mother come before you  You can do better than that  If you struggle with self esteem or self worth like so many of us do  it's all too easy to take the wrong road in a situation like this and decide to put up with it  if you have fears and doubts about meeting somebody else or if you still want to justify having strong feelings for this person  But I hope you won't  It won't be easy and it's going to hurt  It's pretty cowardly of him that rather than him accepting it's his limitations that are ruining this and he should be the one to end it by acting like a man  it ends up as if you're the one who has to break off the relationship instead when you're not the one with the demanding mother threatening suicide  So it reveals something else less than ideal about him that he'd be okay to stick you in this horrible position and now is going to let you carry the burden of making the tough choices    You may care about him but I hope with what happened here that you can maybe see him in a new light and see how weak and pathetic he is acting and maybe that will break the spell about how much you think you love him and make it a little easier to walk away  The refer to these things in relationships as "Red flags" and ultimate we seal our own fate when we either decide to pay attention to those warning signs or try to look away and keep marching forward anyway  You've received a pretty huge red flag in this situation  I wouldn't ignore it  Find something better  Let him be in a relationship with his mom and she can pick a wife for him  Yikes    He's winning a really unfair game right now  that you're continuing to date him and give him all the same sort of access to you despite being told this new change in circumstances  You deserve to be with someone who has to put an equal amount into the relationship and wants the same type of future as you do   I sure hope so  thank you  Having fun with friends  clock strikes midnight    I look around at all the happy couples and my heart sinks  I'm so envious of these people who seem so happy  I know what it feels like  and I desperately want to feel it again    There are many times where I've wanted to give up  but I've made it my goal  my mission  to be one of those people next year   To be a person excited to ring in the new year  sharing a new year's kiss and genuinely be enjoying life    I'm gonna be happy again one day    It may not be this year  and it may not be next year and there'll be a lot of pain along the way   There may be a 0 0001  of finding happiness  but if I give up now  I have no chance   You need to keep taking them though  The way I see it  meds don't really change who we are  we're still the same person really  they just increase our level of functioning somewhat   Man I need to do this    The amount of time my wife spends on FB and her phone in general is depressing   Like I get to the point were I tell her if she gave a 1 10 of the effort into our marriage that she does the phone we would be better off   But she just ignores me and does it even more      Sigh   hugs  I'm sorry it's been such a rough time  Sending you all the love and strength to hang in there  3 Hugs You might find them boring initially but once you get into them you'll love it  Maybe  I know nothing about you so I couldn't say  but those shows are God tier  and it's worth giving it a shot even if you're a little bored at first  I think that's the best gift to yourself  to have that resolution and to stick to it no matter what   I'm sorry to hear about your breakup  It's kinda comforting to know I'm not the only one who feels this way though  Hopefully we figure our shit out  Cheers from the U S of A  My advice  make a list of all the creative projects and ideas and from that pick the one that's the most fun interesting of the bunch  Another way to think of it is consider what you were most looking forward to doing with your free time once winter break started  Then set a ridiculously easy goal as the first step  eg  for a writing prompt  just the first sentence  so you actually get started  With any luck that gets the ball rolling into that laser focused state where you lose track of the time  Hope that helps  For me it does It's crazy that we're brought up by a society that teaches us to ask this question as a polite gesture  not as a genuine concern  The response is always expected to be positive  and if it's anything otherwise  some of us don't know what to say  and often think the other person is just being a whiner  We were never taught how to respond to this type of answer  because we are almost forced to pretend like everything is just peachy   all the time  It's just really sad  and still so crazy to me   Did the same does feel much better  Also there are much better sources for memes than FB  Reading this made me tear up  I am in mourning too  I'm so sorry for your loss  The pain must be simply immense and indescribable  But I believe we'll get through  Big hugs from me to you   Hey bud  I care  Thank you  And I am sorry  I know how uncomfortable and disheartening it is   I am your first paragraph  Although I do feel like I'm at the tail end of things going catastrophic and I might get my life together  Shoot me a pm if you'd like to talk  As long as you're a male we could be clones  Thank you  this gives me hope  I've been stuck in that next day cycle  and it's scaring me to not have control over my future and thoughts  Maybe your ride is due for an upgrade  hope life treats you well friend  Hey  I'm here for you  Would you like to talk more about this  I have just deleted it with IG in the same time as you  I'm thinking of break up with my gf particularly due to social media  she's touchy abt social media  e g  if there's a simple quarrel between us  she'd change her profile picture and cover and her status etc     she lies on Instagram and envy her friends on Facebook  I have just noticed that  but I shouldered alot of bruises from her lately so I can't continue with her for the long run   any advices  How did you met her and why did she dumped you   You're definitely not alone there  I'm trying to learn how to be comfortable without social contact  but as soon as my friends are busy I start feeling that lonely feeling and it's really hard to shake  Sometimes I'll even just put the TV on because that's kind of comforting in a sense that others are watching too  Probably sounds weird af haha  If you pick up any tips  please share    What exactly happened   I agree  Sometimes I feel like shit when I'm off of them  but whether it's for two days or two weeks that I've been off of them  I always come back to them   My father had something sort of similar   his feet would shake tremble when he tried to go down stairs  or put on slippers  or anything that required motor control  It was PTSD  he got into regular therapy  and the symptoms abated  Essentially  the brain  after being ignored so long  used the body to force the issue  Have you and your psych looked at things in your past  That's an interesting way to phrase it  I've enjoyed being alone in the past  so I reckon it's more so the "other things on  my  mind that finally come out when  I  find  myself  alone " The thing I struggle with I suppose is that I'm not even sure what these other things are  There's no concrete thought like "I'm worthless " it's just a general bad feeling  I wonder if that feeling maybe just means the chemicals in my brain are messed up  Because nothing in my life really warrants depression  shit's been pretty good overall  Meds don't sound like a good idea to me though  because once I am with others  I do a lot better  And when I'm at school  I'm hardly ever alone because I'm in a friend group that all lives in the same building   I can't imagine myself ending up like those people you know  though I'll keep them in mind as something to not become  You're right in that it would feel shitty to be the last person on the contact list and everything   Thank you for taking the time to respond  I'm here to listen  if you need to vent anymore  Me either  Like I'm lucky if I get small 3 4 hour blocks of solid sleep  Congrats and good job  I know and understand how hard it is  Hell  I've been keeping it to myself for YEARS  Know that you are so lucky and blessed that your parents are very supportive and accepting you as you are  You can use that as motivation to get better       mine  not so much  I was actually scolded and told things    Althought we used to have very good relathionship    maybe because I'm no longer the smart kid  Hang in there   I never would have thought I would be  in the same mind set of stay alive but since last year I'm struggling  Fuck friends who don't reply to you after you send a text message  period  If they can't be bothered then neither can I   I'm 17 as well and at the complete opposite end of the spectrum  I don't even know if I'm attractive or not  but my grades started fantastic at the start of the year and now they're complete shit  I have a lot of c's and very few a's  I feel he exact same way  but you have a huge advantage on me  You actually have a chance at succeeding in life  Please  for every depressing thought that runs through my dying mind  don't waste it    you have so much potential  I have nothing  live your life  get a good job  do what I'll never be able to do  Dealing with constant depression is   exhausting    We all know how you feel   you're not alone in this   Whatever you do  just take it one day at a time   Nah  definitely not weird  The only tip I've really got is that sometimes I'll go for a run or bike ride  and that helps  It's getting too cold here to do that  but I imagine in Australia it's probably pretty warm this time of year   I'll also try to do something that requires more concentration than watching TV  like   and this is where I'll sound weird   I like translating songs from English into Spanish and vice versa  I learned Spanish in middle and high school  and doing the translating helps me not forget it  And since it requires some brain power  I get distracted  Though I guess distracted is not the same as being comfortable alone  but it does help   If I pick up any less oddly specific tips  I'll definitely send them your way      oh wait I just remembered one more thing actually  When I'm at school and want to be around people but my friends are doing something else  I'll go to the library or a cafe to read or do work or something  That way  even though I'm not interacting with people  I'm still around them  Hearing the distant chatter is kinda comforting   Thanks  I don't want this to turn into a teenage emo thread or account  But sometimes it's nessairy to write feelings down   I don't want to brag about  who is more depressed  who's life has been the worst  How im going to kill myself or hurt myself   Emotions can't  be measured by life  injurys and how much of a psychopath you are   they are what they are and they hurt everyone's the same   And thank you  for what you said I'm not nessairly blaming myself but I just wish I new what he was thinking and feeling  I hope it didn't hurt although  I know life was killing him and for years he was in pain  at least  now I know he is free    I have lots to be happy for to live for just lots of bad things happened in 2016 and I just havnt had time to sort it all out in my head yet  This being one of the ones which has effected me the most   It's nice to have someone to listen and just read what im typing  one day maybe I will manage to get all my feeling about the unfortunate events of my 21 years on earth written down  But I'd like to put some to the best times I have had to although sometimes life gets covered by a dark cloud life is wonderful  I have one of the most amazing and wonderful life's  I don't have  much money but evrey day  I spend my life caring for nature  big birds of prey  exotic animals  dogs and my favourite  horses  I help my friend go around at weekends and teach people about these animals and help them handle them  Life is beautifull but it can also be ugly just like nature    I'm sorry about what happened  I like to think evrything happens for a reason and perhaps for the greater good it has made you more determin and prevent more events such as

suicide and consider yourself negligent in preventing it  but you don't deserve to carry this weight alone  You're going through your own issues just as she was  and in the end it was your sister that made up her mind to find an ending  and I feel like it would have been impossible to stop her regardless  It's difficult to avoid "could have" and "should have" thought patterns for sure  but I want you to know that while such statements may indeed be true   we all could have and should have done certain things that we never did   it is also true that we often don't have the level of control over others' actions that we think we do  I'm so sorry for your loss and for the pain you're going through  I hope that one day you will find peace and healing  There was a time when Elon Musk was bald and technically cash poor  Check the pic  http   images boomsbeat com data images full 4273 paypal jpg jpg I met her at her party which a mutual friend invited me to  We were instantly interested in each other and I ended up staying with her for days after the party finished just talking about everything  We would talk all night and all day every waking moment I immediately felt sick with love for her  I had never spoken to anyone in my life so openly   I don't know why we ended we just kept finding ways to argue  She felt like I didn't care about her and I felt like she wasn't as in to me as she had been in the past so the last time she walked out I didn't call her and she never called me  Fb has honestly played a big part in feeding my paranoia and depression and I deactivated it this morning and fuck I have been looking up at the world all day  Hopefully this lasts for a while and I can learn some more about this world and see the attraction to living     Thank you  Haha you don't sound weird  that's actually really interesting  I need to find some kind of hobby or something I'm interested in for sure   Not a bad idea to go to a cafe or something but it's so intimidating for me to sit somewhere alone  I'd probably end up just staring at my phone before leaving haha if she's intoxicated with social media then dont pretend to be ok with it  i aint gonna tell you to break up with her cause idk the full story but id recommend you have a serious talk with her  you'll know what to do then  it really sucks when you have to remind someone to look up from their phones    props to u for deleting that shit   jesus died for people like you  thnks brother Gr8 m8  keep it up   live life for yourself  Speaks to me on so many levels  Thank you  relatable as hell  fuck yeah   These comments mean the world to her and me  thank you too  From my experience It's been a year and I still haven't gotten over anything  New Years Eve I freaked because I saw a pic of my ex and her current boyfriend  It still hurts for me  After a year my pathetic ass can't get over her  Everyones different though  Most people say it takes time and that might help  In my opinion looking for someone new to replace old feelings would probably help a lot to  My ex did it and shes having the time of her life now  Hanging out with friends to get your mind off the situation helps  It's definitely ok to be sad but its important that you start the process of moving forward   Thank you for sharing   We often discuss my past but i don't really have a reason for PTSD  My life hasn't had any really high impact negative events  It's been more a boring pointless slog  Legit just deactivated my fb which is weird for me because I'm on it all the time and my best friend in the whole world messages me asked me if I'm ok  I say "no I'm really not ok"  She messaged back with "fair enough"  This is someone who says they would do anything for me and be here for me no matter what  Someone I have on countless times dropped my whole life in a minute to help her out and all I get is fair enough    come on    friends are shit and actions speak louder than words   My New Years resolution make it until Saturday when I can finally get back to my psychiatrist    Long term resolutions overwhelm me haha I might just start having new week resolutions  Yeah  it feels like most of the time people don't even mean it  That's why I stopped asking it unless I really want to know the answer  So most of the times I ask  it's with a close friend  It would be nice to live in a society where you could answer honestly and not be judged for it  where people would care instead of distancing themselves   r BPDlovedones can help you          that small connection can sometimes be the thing to make you keep going   Exactly this    Thank you  Your post reads like a classic example of Borderline Personality Disordered abuse  It can be very confusing  please don't blame yourself  I am  unfortunately  not skilled with words  But if you post there  Im sure someone will give the advice you need  Thank you  I have gotten the post up over there  She has tried to say that I am bi polar on top of my depression  even though my therapist said otherwise  i stopped using facebook years ago   hands down one of the best decisions i made in my entire life   As someone older than you  life at your age can change very quickly in a year  Which can also seem like an eternity when you are depressed  but I assure you it happens    Finding purpose in life is fluid  It changes and often purpose isn't clear until after we have fulfilled it  Start small  Who would be sad without you  Your mother   Your purpose is to simply be you  the person they love  to exist  Do you have a pet  Your purpose is to care and feed them  Life makes us believe we have to make millions and be famous or change the world to have purpose  Ultimately  getting up everyday and fighting a good fight is enough  Sorry to hear that  if she was already leaving then coming back  then it was going to happen  Best of luck  I would definitely recommend it  it made me feel a lot more comfortable with staying on my meds  I also did a lot of digging on PubMed  but the research published on lithium exposure isn't very extensive because it's obviously hard to test in any way other than self reported studies  The biggest risk seems to be a heart valve defect  but like I said  the doctors I saw aren't convinced that the incidence of that is actually any higher than the general population  I believe risk is dose dependent though  so that might be work talking to MFM about  I take 600mg day  also take lamictal and risperidone    just noticed your username  chuckled a little  cheers m8 Already ahead of you  My life has been so quiet and nearly drama free this past 5 months  Gave me time to focus on myself and not be afraid to be myself   Also no more snide comments     Now the only thing keeping me down is myself and my job  Today is a horrible day for me at work  I got stuck in the snow and apparently the tow truck jerked my pallets around in my trailer  Grapes everywhere      Thank you for the advice  I thought about it a lot off and on the last couple of days  I know that I need to do something for myself besides just telling my boyfriend  as good of a support as he is  This sounds silly but I am almost scared to make a call like that because it means admitting it to myself  if that makes sense  I don't know if I am ready to  I feel that I am in a better place having told someone and that like I said  I know I need to make a move for myself  which I am okay with right now    Right now  I think I am in a spot where I feel okay with setting up an appointment with a doctor and getting back on medication  I was taking something for both my depression and anxiety  although it mostly just curbed the overwhelming thoughts that I didn't leave something on and made interactions with people a little bit easier by freeing me from obsessing over what I said  If I feel comfortable with the Doctor  I might talk to them about how low I felt  For some reason that is easier than calling    I do think that knowing what you should do and having training does make it harder and I totally agree that it is more isolating  I feel like it makes you feel more guilty by not doing something because everyone knows that you "know better"  I get the thing with the meds too  It is so so so easy to think that they aren't working or needed any more and quiet them  It is like the 2nd or 3rd time I have stopped  although I think it has been 4 or 5 months since I stopped  Now that I think about it too  I had a hard time feeling weak for needing to take them    I had a really awful ex that made me feel that way about needing help and I think some it stuck around after leaving him     I am a bit confused though  what did you mean by saying that "They say you are supposed to"  That you are supposed to quit them or want to  people here dont need saving and then two days later you can see 20 posts about how no one is helping them  Cooking eh  I dont know jack shit in cooking haha  All i know what to cook is an omelet  Do you have any interests in becoming a chef  You can turn your hobbies into happy realities ye know     What games do you play by the way  Do you have steam  We can play some games together if you wanna   NAMI and DBSA both have meetings that might be near you and people have suggested meetup com    BUT   if internet friends will do  the skype chat in the sidebar has been excellent for keeping me company and helping me feel normal and understood  It's an online support group  so that helps me at least  Shoot me a pm and I'll send you a link to join  Anger is also a form of depression  Which is why I don't get bent out of shape bc sum1 is probably as far down the rabbit hole as I am  I only use Facebook to   judge new pictures that girls I went to high school with put up  Literally the only reason why I still have it up  That site never helped with my social anxiety  Since I deleted it  I have read more  watched more movies and slowly getting my garage ready for woodworking   you ever have those days where you can't do anything else except focus on how shit you feel  that  Me too  These aren't real people  They are just the mask people want you to see  I'd call the police    They record the conversations I think right  Those people need to be fired before they get anyone killed   I'm so sorry that happened to you   Same thing happened to me  She was acting like talking to me was really getting in the way of whatever else she had to be doing  thing is  you are not really gonna keep in touch  You'll see their pictures  but everyone knows you only show the good   And you're not gonna talk with them much  At some point  it'll only be "happy birthday"  which they forgot but FB reminded them  Was raped a lot growing up Wow thank you for posting this  I was totally ignorant of "atypical" depression and thought I just had heavy limbs because I am a worthless human being   It did not occur to me that it might be a symptom of my longstanding depression    So     No advice  but if you do find that MAOIs or any supplements help you  I hope you will post again    Anyone who disagrees with suicide Thanks Please don't feel that way because evidently the people at the other end was the shitty and worthless one  I mean they're supposed to be trained counsellors and not be a judgemental b  Anyway  like what many others would say  vent it out  this sub is always open and available   This is something that I want to do  slowly weening myself off of social media  Not good  especially when I constantly compare myself to others and look at my old friends posts so accurate  I think you might have dysthimia   Just tell your doctor exactly what you said here  maybe add at the end something like "I think I have some sort of depression or something  like dysthimia or some stuff"  Good luck mate  Keep reminding yourself of how important this one thing is  and keep your focus on that  Fuck the depression  keep getting up when it knocks you down  Your writing is beautiful and you're using a tone that reminds me of my own  combining opposites  e g  wisdom and folly   It's a delight to read  even if it was inspired by unhappy feelings  I loved your choice of words in "diurnal mourning " too  it's beautiful and I never would have thought of that   And it sucks to be inpatient this time of year  I at least made it past new year's day before I ended up inpatient  but I'm pretty sure I spent valentines day in a psych hospital  I was in love at the time   Consider buying homeworkouts on DVD along with some adjustable dumbbells   The advantage of getting a DVD workout is that the onscreen instructor will tell you about good form   If what you want is strength training  since you mention bodybuilding  a few good DVD instruction workouts include  P90X or P90X3  these ones use a pull up bar in addition to dumbbells  Rushfit  martial arts combined with endurance strength training  Body Beast  more traditional bodybuilding I think  uses dumbbells and pull up bar and bench  And MOSSA  which is coming out on DVD soon   I know it because it used to be available on XBox  fun workouts for beginner or intermediate  some martial arts and some weights workouts   If you buy adjustable dumbbells  there are two types  standard size or Olympic size  It is important to make this decision first because the weight plates fit either one or the other size but not both  Olympic size has a higher weight limit and the handle is thicker  Find out highest limit  and decide based on that whether you will ever need Olympic or if standard is enough for you  If your long term goal is very heavy weight  then you could decide on Olympic from beginning   The plates can be reused for barbells in the future  but I read recommendation to start with dumbbells for 1 3 years before moving to barbell  Once you decide on size  you can buy a bunch of plates of different weights to gradually attach to your dumbbells    Start low weight  and increase very gradually  for example every 2 3 weeks increase by smallest possible amount     I recommend getting more than one set of handles for dumbbells so you can have two or three different sizes prepared for your workout and don't need to take time to switch plates during the workout  For some muscles you will be able to use heavier dumbbells than for others   An important thing to keep in mind  if you do strength training with weights  do not exercise same muscles two days in a row  Plan to let the muscle rest for 48 hours before working same muscle again  Either alternate lower body days and upper body days  or alternate strength and cardio workouts  Yes its sad realizing that time never stops  I know what you mean  Going through this right now  Based on the recommendations of my PCP  P Doc  and Pharmacists I'm switching over from the lithium   clonazepam combo to Latuda  Hopefully this helps  30yo and have had feelings similar to what you describe for the past 15 years  Talking to anybody can help  If you're still in education there are services available that might be able to help  In my experience they weren't great but I took what I could from it and moved on  Don't force yourself through somebody else's process  find what works for you   I currently see a private therapist but I'm still deciding if it is going to work for me    Something that I have found helpful in the past is to try disconnecting for periods of time  Just a few hours a week  No distractions from tech or online or other people  Even music  Use the time to work on yourself or explore your thoughts and feelings on paper  It sounds lame and it can honestly be pretty terrifying but if it helps you to understand yourself more it will be worth it  Just remember that it is for you  Be cautious about sharing it   Thats fascinating  I wonder if thats why i have a addictive personality  You've endured so much  and you've accomplished so much  You're strong  I also have PTSD due to growing up with a lot of physical and mental emotional abuse  Feel free to message me if you ever would like to talk     i know that feeling perfectly well  but im trying to do something with gaming  or atleast something that touches the world of games  you could try to do youtube for a living and build up some confidence  and try focusing on school if the YouTube plan wont work  do have patience with YouTube tho  well just some suggestions whatever you wanna do after reading this is still up to you bro I'm actually switching off Latuda soon for some problems it's causing me  But my experience has been mostly positive  It can still be a great year  These feelings are inevitable when you have depression  I was super depressed when the new year struck  but i still have long term goals for the year that I am excited about  that I know will help my mental health get better  Am I going to get severely depressed along the way  lose hope  and want to hurt myself again  I am sure I am  But does that mean I won't try my hardest to kick depression in the ass  Nope    I believe in every single one of you who feel so hopeless right now   You can do this   Mate seriously  be proactive about it  If you let depression and anxeity be in the back of your head when you're trying study it's going to weigh you down  please put yourself first  Good luck  That sucks   When it comes to tips  I think it's good to not set your bar too high  To recognize that even going outside for a bit is a step forward  It's common to get stuck in some sort of absolutist mindset where either everything is as it was before or it's hopeless  So I guess just focus on getting your everyday routines in order regarding sleep  and force yourself to just go outside  doesn't have to be anything big  Agreed abort it asap if you're even questioning wanting it   A child is the last thing you need right now  I just made an account to tell you  that hopefully everything will be ok with your life  Taking your life is not a solution  you are not the reason your parents are splitting up  I know this hurts  but remember that time heals all wounds and hopefully this will make you stronger   Power through this  I can you can find some power to get through this   For obvious reasons I can't say exactly what happened  I've spent major parts of my life trying to help this person  but eventually got rejected hard when I thought we were friends  Please don't even think about killing yourself  Parents splitting up really sucks and you have every right to feel sad angry about it  just try to cope with it  it will get better eventually  It might even be an opportunity for them to start over and be happier than they are now    it takes time of course  it's like a grieving process i guess Ugh  I know the type Not really  Only online support for those matters  It matters though  I had therapy but felt that the therapist was not much help and was not at the same wave lenght in understanding  as I did not feel understood  However thanks for listening  kind stranger I was going to suggest this as well  If your area does not have one  start one  It isn't too hard  You might be able to find  with the help of this website  a mental health advocate in your area   Thank you so much I appreciate it  Yeah  I can understand even that  Happy birthday  mate  I hope you feel better  I totally understand what you are feeling  There is something about finding people who get you on a certain level where you don't feel like you have to explain things  This might take time  These people are around  you just need to uncover them and it will take some time      I do have a best friend that I met in my late 30's who isn't bipolar but understands me as if she was bipolar  There are some of those folks around      You might want to get involves with some groups that represent some hobbies and interests you have  I also think looking into the NAMI website as people have suggested is helpful   What are your exams  I hope you'll feel better soon  happy birthday   Dude  suicidal thoughts are never far from my mind  even when going through a good patch  I kind of think of it as though I'm hard wired that way  even with a whole bunch of new circuitry that single one remains   I know this is going to be a contradiction  but I don't think suicidal thoughts like these necessarily mean you want to complete a suicide  I just think your brain has trained itself that way  At least thats how I've rationalised it for myself  You are not to blame for any of that happening  You are not a bad person  You are someone who was brave enough to reach out in a desperate time and you got treated like shit by people who are supposed to help you  That's entirely their fault and nothing you should feel ashamed of    Please don't let this stop you from reaching out again because a person on the other end of the phone who actually knows what they're doing can make a big difference  I'm sorry that they treated you like that though   I've been on Effexor XR 150mg  started with 75mg  since summer but it has yet to show any effect on me  or maybe I didn't notice   We are still patiently waiting  I hope we can find a medication that works for me soon because I really can't stand living and might go for ending my life at this rate  I find that I often want to help people but I'm in such a delicate state myself that if I were to get one thing wrong and cause damage I wouldn't be able to bear it  I read every single post on this subreddit but don't respond to them all  and I'm sure many other people do too  Personally  suicidal ideation is a way to exercise a feeling of control when things in life seem out of control  When you know you can fold the cards and leave the table whenever you want  losing doesn't sting as much  But I would had preferred of not getting dragged to play this game in the first place  I was on Sertralin  Zoloft  50mg for about a year  Till I felt better and took myself off it  Bad idea  I loved it but people said it made me very bland and neutral   Then went on to citalopram which was OK but didn't really do much    Now I'm off everything  moved abroad and cant get to a docs  its not too bad  Have my off days but its sunnier and more relaxed here which helps my mental health   oh no  don't do that  have you tried other meds  I know cymbalata worked amazing for me  but my insurance no longer covers it for me unfortunately  Trintellix   Mirtazapine would be a good antidepressant combination to antagonise 5 HT receptors known to have antidepressant effect  5 HT2A 2C 3 7  and Alpha 2 adrenergic receptors   The only downside with Mirtazapine is that it's a potent H 1 antagonist which causes drowsiness and sedation  Some say it subsides over time while others say it never truly goes away  It's also a weak mAChRs antagonist  670nM   It's claimed to have negligible anticholinergic effects but I'm skeptical since Abilify's mAChRs antagonism is in the 1000's but it's still considered to have  ACB Scale of 1  http   www agingbraincare org uploads products ACB scale   legal size pdf   So although Mirtazapine hasn't been tested  it could potentially have ACB scale of 2 which is concerning   Another downside with Trintellix   Mirtazapine is that it's missing the NRI part  Unless if Mirtazapine's Alpha 2 adrenergic antagonism can make up for that   While Nortriptyline has a nice pharmacologic profile  I feel like its mAChRs antagonism  40nM  is too potent for me to want to try it    So I'm currently leaning towards Trintellix   Mirtazapine or Reboxetine  yeah I think so too  It's how my brain works  I'm not that worried that it's dangerous for me  It sort of bums me out though  I feel disappointed with myself  I haven't gotten to the point of deciding to get pregnant but have discussed it with my pdoc  hypothetically  and he said if I was to go that route that I should be seeing a "high risk obgyn " Kind of made sense to me given the whole med issue  I have the same fears regarding meds  Also i would drive myself crazy trying to figure all of that out  There is probably a specialist or a psychiatrist you could consult with to plan a pregnancy   I thought this year would be a new start but then I realised just because the year has changed doesn't mean my illness has magically disappeared   I was on Zoloft to but then it stopped working  I had brain zaps when I got off of it  My bf is citalopram  which I feel like isn't the best antidepressant  but that's just my opinion  maybe he needs a higher dosage  but how did you get off of everything  that is what I would love to do  are you on any supplements to help  You know yourself better than anyone here  so you'll have to just figure out whether or not it will be better for you  Personally  weed helps my anxiety depression immensely but it  can  get to a point where it's no longer doing me any good  It can make me hungry  and make me wanna eat which can be very bad  but at the same time it can ease my anxieties going into social situations and allow me to relax and feel better  I don't know your history so decide for yourself  ya know  Is it at a point where it's going to help you process your emotions and help you get better  Or does it have negative effects  I'm sorry you had such a horrible experience  I never called one of these before but I was considering calling a hotline when I hit a serious low point a few weeks ago  Well  this just goes to show that it seems like not calling wasn't such a bad thing after all  Yep  8 months and I just want to kill myself for being an unlovable shit   Force yourself to contact a few of the people you're avoiding  the ones who you really like  I know it's painful to feel useless and a failure  but everyone does at some point or another  although depression is pretty much feeling it 24 7   People close to you will understand if you're going through a rough patch  Having a minimum of social interaction goes a long way   Personally  I just send a quick message and go from there  I also try to go out and get groceries on specific days to develop a routine   I know the feelings you describe   I am 6 years on from a life changing ruining   career ending and multiple relationship  ending series of manic episodes   It has been really hard to move on but as someone else commented I just try to keep moving forward  People always have   a hard time separating me from my illness   That includes me  I just wanted to say that it gets easier even if it doesnt go away completely and realise that you are not alone feeling like this  You are not alone  I'm glad you think so  Seriously been going through the exact same thing while here on Winter break  But you know what  I went back to school to celebrate NYE and I loved it  Sure now I am back at home  but I know more good times will come in the future  That kind of put me at ease and now there isn't much pressure when I am home to make plans with old friends  But that's my situation  if you ever wanna vent about yours or just talk about random shit  don't hesitate to hit me with a pm  You just have to stop giving a damn  Realize it was your illness spiraling you out of control and you are presently healing and learning to live with it  We all have some embarassing  "crazy" episodes with this illness unfortunately  You are not the first person in the world nor the last to act erraticly  Focus on your future  Same for me  The worst part is when you assume that someone is lonely and you start to develop some kind of sympathy for that person that you don't even know  or barely know  because you believe that this person would understand what you feel  Then  his her girlfriend boyfriend friend family member  comes in  they start to have fun and you feel like the only lonely person on the planet  At least that's how it ends for me  You aren't alone  I feel many of the things you do  Even got a bad back because of an accident  because why not add that to my list of problems     I'm impressed at the effort you put into improving yourself  Seriously  that's awesome  Just do those things for yourself  I hate a lot of things about myself too  but I keep working at it  I don't know what difference it'll make  and I try not to think about the future too much  I just focus on the present and try to shut out the negative thoughts  The first one is Calculus then Modern Physics then Java  So maybe it is situational  but getting help could still be very useful  would you consider seeing a therapist  I honestly don't know at this point I've been there  It sure is depressing  Have you gone to councilling  I know it's easy to just say this  but you have no reason to feel disappointed  you can't get upset at your own chemistry  I go through the same thing  with suicidal thoughts and other aspects of my depression  and even though I can't just stop myself feeling guilty or disappointed I always try to logic it out and keep in mind that I can't alter my biology  Easier said than done  I know     Okay mate  message me specific problems and I can help with them  and if I can't I'll get someone else to give me a hand  It's been a while since I programmed and I used another language so I'll get in touch with an IT friend for you  But  you need to set yourself some achievable targets right now  even if it's just a single page  You can't say  'today I will learn all the math ' because you won't achieve that and then you'll want to say fuck it to the rest of the studying  Making the targets small also helps with attitude  because even if you're feeling really down you can usually motivate yourself to do something if you know it's easy to achieve  Yeah it's an amphetamine  Ya you probably wouldn't want to take it if you have heart problems  This goes against everything   everything  a hotline would do   Call them back  and tell them what happened  This is not the way it should go  You also may want to read the  hotline FAQ  http   redd it 1c7ntr  from  r SuicideWatch  specifically        I called and it was a bad experience  I still need help  what do I do    Call back  and let the responder know what happened  Crisis intervention  especially if suicidality is a factor  is not easy  and not even the experts get it perfect every time  Personally  if I have a call go "south" on me  nothing makes me happier than to know that the person called back and had a better conversation with one of my colleagues    If you found yourself being rude or verbally abusive  apologize if you can  but either way try to hang in there with us  We understand that people in crisis struggle with self control  you don't need to be calm or businesslike but it really helps if you can show that you're trying your best to work with us    If you have a complaint about a hotline experience  please try to report it to the hotline administration    If you want to talk I'm here if you want  If you feel unsure about opening up to me you may want to look into my comment history to see if I'm 'OK'  You are not alone all right   hugs  They're a couple of shows on PBS about building houses and wood working  Ya it seems to be helping  I still feel down sometimes when I haven't slept right though  I think you should wait more  like 2 3 months since you stopped  Weed usually take 2 3 months to be flushed out of your body  It's normal you feel like shit and it doesnt change anything because you're still in withdrawal  Keep up the good work and you'll see the benefit soon   even if you feel like you don't want to do it  just deactivate your account  hey  you can always re activate it  I felt the same exact way as you but after I deleted it  I knew I wasn't going to regret my decision   This couldn't possibly be more inaccurate  As a former hotline worker  at my call center  we were all volunteers  The people who are there have gone through hours and hours of training and are donating their time to help people in need     Whether or not calls are recorded depends on the state  in some states its illegal to record calls without consent  in others you can    I really relate  thank god someone feels the same way Thank you  you're right it does help to think of it in that way  I spent so many years pushing and pushing myself and that's done more harm than good  approaching the anxiety differently and at my own pace is a much more hopeful way forward   I don't have a specific problem with understanding math  The problem is that I can't get myself to sit down and study the lectures and answer the work sheets  If I just did this I am good for the exam  I just have to panic to start doing all the due shit   I just want to get out from this bad habit and motivate myself  I am always feeling down  The first step is getting through your grieving process  it's the toughest part but eventually you'll come out of the other end of that dark tunnel  After that take it one day at a time  reassure yourself that it's his loss and move on  This is honestly super reassuring even on the opposite end  With my anxiety I always assume I am going to be judged because I am thin and it seems like I have no business being at the gym since I already am an ideal body weight    I'm terrified someone judging me because I don't need to exercise since I am either too thin or look fine so I should stop  Exercising helps me feel powerful and free and as though I can take on anything  Looks don't matter  it's the feeling more than anything  I'm battling a nasty cold too  It stinks even though I cannot smell  I feel like a failure since I had to take a break to let myself heal   But I know it's not the end  Because I chose to let my body heal it will perform better more quickly than if I didn't  There are more days ahead and missing a few doesn't negate the days I did exercise in the past  I'll do a little routine today to get back on track    Happy New Year  Don't apologize  it's not worth it   You know what depressed people need more of  Harsh criticisms  Harsh criticism will make everything better   sarcasm i truly hope things get better for you     same here i think about more than one time a day   What kind of jobs have you tried so far  Are there any kinds of jobs you know you wouldn't be able to do mentally or physically  And do you know what kind of boss worker customer groups you're looking to avoid or join specifically  These three questions can help form the base for your search if you want to begin looking for yourself  As for suggestions is a bit difficult without knowing you but here's 3 for funsies     "Movie theatre usher"   very easy most of the time  not much work for not much pay  but you won't have to deal with people outside easy directions inside a building or a hello     "Pizza delivery"   the biggest downside here is you need a car  after that the people you interact with will be hungry people  sometimes ass holes but you can't avoid that  relaxing in their own home and a few Co workers doing the same thing you are  Okay pay  and if you get tipped well you can make pretty good money     "Flight attendant"   you'd be dealing with a large group of people  a large portion of whom will likely be up their own ass  But the pay is solid and it gets you away from everything while you work  think mini vacations every trip you take   The hours are tough  but the possibility of fun and relaxation outside of literally being on the plane  are high     Hope I could help a little  any insight you would be willing to give might garner better advice    So sorry for you  I hope everything gets better  i am on zyprexa it doesn't help much   I think I speak for everyone here when I say we care about you and are here for you   If you ever need anyone to talk to  I'm here  Even the small victories count   Happy Birthday  do yourself something nice today if you can      I wish you the best Have you thought of trying something else  Never heard of zyprexa I think that if the only motivation you have is to settle the situation in your mind  you should do it   Chances are your ex is fine and has come to terms with whatever happened   If you do this be honest  but be protective of yourself  There's no need to gut yourself over this  Hey do you wanna talk about it   Im here for you pls have a think of it before you do something wrong  Hello    how old are you  you told that you are scared to talk with your mom  parents   but are there other people that could help you through your bad days  maybe you dont even need people  but just a funny movie or you eat your favourite cookies on these days to get your mood up a bit   sorry for the bad english   they ridicule you for their own insecurities  who gives a shit where you are in life it's no ones business but yours   i think i spelled it wrong it doesn't matter my parents don't want me on anything stronger than that   I emphasize with your struggles  I was going through a very stressful time in college this most recent semester  Last year I was prescribed Fluoxetine which worked fairly well for my depression except for the side effects including nightmares   headaches  tremors  jaw clenching  the occasional mania  which I kind of miss except for one serious incident where I felt way too good after finals    I was walking with my former girlfriend outside a giftshop that played Ohio State's marching band songs and tried doing a high kick like the drum major after she told me to and ended up kicking myself into the air  I landed on my arm   hyperextending and fracturing my left elbow and wrist on asphalt    yeah    that left me feeling like a grade A moron after an ambulance had to be called since I was in the worst pain of my life and couldn't stand up  She felt so guilty because she thought it was her fault since she told me to do it but I definitely wouldn't have made such a reckless high kick if I was on the mood stablizer I'm on now     etc  After about 7 months of enduring the side effects I had enough  so I switched to Zoloft which didn't work out for me  and then Wellbutrin which made my anxiety nearly impossible to manage on my own   After being prescribed three different medications by family doctors  I was told I had to see a psychiatrist  so I called the on campus psychiatric services asking for an outpatient appointment  The phone conversation went like this     Hello     Hi  I'd like to schedule an appointment     Sorrywe'refull  hangs up   I was stressed out enough before I called  After I heard the sound of a phone slamming down to hang up I involuntarily let out a torrential downpour of tears  People who are suffering from any mental illness are likely to struggle with getting help on their own  especially with depression  People  like me  who on some days have barely enough motivation to get out of bed but realize how much they're suffering and try to get help should not be treated this way  but unfortunately there's people out there who work mental health jobs who don't truly care   Don't let this stop you from seeking help from elsewhere  There are people out there who really do care and will help you   Thank you very much hey mate   im 16 and was in that situation before    Honestly the only way to end that situation if you want to is  to straight up talk to her about your concerns and feelings just like you did to us in this subreddit  and if you think about it  there is nothing to loose by doing that  I know you need to be very brave to do this  but im sure you are strong enough   3 hope i helped in some way i dreamed once that i was in a relationship with my crush  as i woke up and realized it was a dream i felt absolutely devasteted for the first 5 minutes or so   still hurts tho    I hope you feel better soon   I do the same thing  Writing them down may help  I'm learning to appreciate things again as well Hey  sorry I only just saw this  I think what this sub shows is that people do care  it just maybe takes living with this condition to be able to properly empathise  Any time you want to talk i'm happy to  Right  I want to have something to focus on  Much rather be physically tired Glad for you  I hope things get even better  You two made my whole day right there  i just wanna thank you for sharing it    I'm stuck in a really bad financial situation and my living situation is extremely toxic  I feel vulnerable  I can't afford my car anymore and there's something wrong with it anyway  You have a huge backpack to carry  i wish you all the best with that  Problems like yours are not easy to solve  i myself am in a similar situation and i think we should just try and find something we really want to live for  and then we can start to build our live back up  always with that one thing in our minds   sorry for the bad english back   Can you write down what goes through your mind  Maybe it will sort it a bit  If i have those   im loosing my mind" feelings  i turn my headphones up and listen to music super loud  that helps   try   iridescent" from linkin park  and tell me how you like it   Hope you are feeling better soon   I've been a welder  mechanic  remodeled houses  delivery driver  retail  I don't think I can go back to that   I don't like working alone but I don't do well with a lot of people either  Physically I don't think I can weld anymore   I'm only mid thirties but I'm in pretty bad shape  Thank you for your response you put a lot of thought into it  I am so sorry  That is awful  It feels like a omen  a sign and a portent  It's not  I promise  Counselors and people who field calls are people  and as with people in any profession  some  perhaps most  of them will not operate at the level they should be operating at   It's frustrating when the mental health system often only gets one or a few shots at offering help and giving you hope  and the person you interface with doesn't have the capacity to offer anything constructive and does more harm than good   Happened to me in a different setting  when I hit rock bottom and knew I needed help  I went to see a therapist and he spent an entire session making fun of me and cracking jokes about my situation  It was gut wrenching  I still feel sick thinking about those sessions  This guy was well respected and credentialed  I was a person hanging on by a thread who desperately needed help and because of his ignorance I went another 6 months not seeing any professional whatsoever  I wouldn't have found my way back at all without support people who basically forced me to because they assumed  quite correctly  it's what I would've wanted if I were thinking clearly    I found a better therapist who's actually good at her damn job and things have gotten better  I'm not telling you this as a "go get 'em  champ" sort of thing  Sometimes the system is so prohibitively ineffective that people go years without finding someone who can actually give the help they need    The point is  the failures of the system do not reflect you or your condition  Don't believe anyone who suggests that anything less than complete support and validation from a professional means your situation is not serious  It is  You wouldn't be seeking help and posting on here if it wasn't  The likelihood that the person you've communicated with is kind of shitty at what they do is far greater than your problems being trivial and unimportant   Thank you for taking the step to share your experience here  I'm sorry everything has to be so hard right now   Contact someone higher up  like a manager thats just so true   There are high points and pitfalls when it comes to recovery  It takes a long fucking time  I'm still not even there yet  I was told that things aren't always going to be good  and that's okay  there will be bad days  I'm glad I was told honestly because that makes the really shitty days a bit easier to get through  knowing that it will happen and to not freak out when you aren't happy 100  of the time   It's not good to say 'everything will be fine'   You are still going to feel pain  but you will also feel happy at times as well  It's not easy  but people should be told like I was  that it isn't always going to be good  You have to feel bad to feel good   it sucks  but it's how we are  depression just makes pain a hell of a lot worse  There are so many lonely people here  Why can't we be friends    For me it's because I fear that I lost my ability to "connect" to people  no matter how nice and well meaning they are  That I have nothing to contribute and just bore others  That they 'find out' about me   Recently there was a  "looking for friends" thread  https   www reddit com r depression comments 5ko0li anyone hear want to be friends   in this sub  But I can't really participate in that   Please don't think your 'genes' make you not a good person  You're defined by things you do  things you think  and things you like  And please don't think people don't like you because of your appearance  Even if some people are actually like that  that's because THEY are pieces of shit  And you don't have to be good at study and sports  Those two are not the only gifts people could have  You have so much more possibilities  please don't give up yet  It's never too late  23 year old here  I have support groups in my area  but none of the times offered work for my schedule  So I do the online DBSA young adult support groups  I recommend it  The groups are informative and it's nice to be able to talk to the same people every week  Online friends are definitely different from in person friends  but I'm assuming you're wanting someone to confide in and provide support for your condition  which is what everyone in the support group does   Hey you may of wasted time writing that out  but maybe it kept you from focusing on negative thoughts for fifteen minutes   I have been feeling so especially crappy lately too and I'm just trying to hang in there    I'm glad you at least say that you won't harm yourself   I'm sure you have something to contribute to the world be it big or small and we need you to stick around to accomplish that   Things can get better   One baby step at a time     I agree that the world we live in these days sucks and that so many people are less fortunate than us   Lots of people are unhappy and it's not commonly talked about   Just know you're not alone and try to challenge some of your negative thoughts   Remember to ask yourself if you're jumping to negative conclusions   Trying to postulate how you would perceive your circumstances if you were a positive thinker  just as an exercise     I hope things turn up for the better   Get your heart rate up if you can  go for a walk today    Yes  Suicidal thoughts are a feeling  They sit in a cloud that constantly shrouds over you  Even when you're happy and laughing  the thought and feeling of suicide is still there  it never completely fades  It may not feel as strong on a scale  it may be lower  but it's still there  No matter where I am or what I'm doing the thought and feeling of suicide is always present somewhere in my mind   even if I'm not trying to think about it  the cloud remains  The feeling never passes  Those are very beautiful  She has great skill  Hi  it doesn't seem like you know much about weed so don't give advice  Weed is out of your system in 1 month and there are no withdrawal symptoms besides boredom and insomnia   As for your question OP  I need more information before I can give you some advice  How often did you smoke weed  How much did you smoke  Were you depressed before you started smoking  I look forward to more of these  Do you still have feelings  Now that you are on an even keel are you realizing you truly did not want to end it but did it because you were going through an episode or struggles so you pushed them away  The first step is to stop thinking someone else is your whole world   You are your whole world   period  It's a hobby  It's almost universally an unpaid position   I've come to realize like any medication  moderation is key right  But its days like today i pulled up to work to find out the shop was closed   GREAT i get the day off   but not so great cuz I'll probably just smoke my face off even though i know I'll regret it  Now I'll probably pace my home for a couple hours trying to convince myself to do the hundred other things i need to get done which leads to realizing the time  money  and energy its gonna take which leads to feeling hopeless and depressed and plotting a clean easy fail safe suicide   I don't suggest smoking when unemployed especially just to pass already idle time  I've always made it a point not to when in your situation   I think we all know in the back of our mind when we're abusing a substance dont let the self destructive thoughts overcome   also ANY work is better than none even if has nothing to do with your career   i had a lot of fun stocking shelves nights   Anyway i hope something in there helps  Also there was a list of movies on front page about "loners" for better of a word   I ended up watching one called NAKED  1993  its on KODI if you have it   strange yes but has really interesting dialog  I can't offer much help for people with depression as someone who suffers from it everyday  I just think its important to reach out to other people and see you are not alone in how you feel  Depression makes you feel isolated and insecure and so I look at various support sites for people with depression as a way to cope and connect with people like myself  01110011 01100101 01101110 01100100 01110011 00100000 01100100 01101001 01100111 01101001 01110100 01100001 01101100 00100000 01101000 01110101 01100111  At the hardest point in my life  I called the suicide hotline and the person on the other side just seemed so disinterested in helping  not to mention the half hour of waiting for someone to be available    I'm sorry you had such an awful experience  I think there are better ways of getting more meaningful help  Try 7 Cups Of Tea  It hard to save someone online  People with depression need real support as well as the motivation to get better to make changes in their lives  I see depression as a response to how one is feeling in their environment as for me I get really depressed when my social anxiety kicks in and I am not able to do things the way I want to  Making changes is hard and frustrating and oftentimes requires to leave someone or something behind  Holy Moly  As soon as i looked at these  I got goosebumps all over my body   Everything is so accurate down to the last detail  Thank you to you and your sister for sharing this with us  Lots of love xo Just started with Effexor XR last week  and hit the target dosage  225mg  today    I'm currently in the adjustment phase  so I'm experiencing pretty much all the listed side effects   fatigue  dizziness  spacing out  no appetite whatsoever  near complete sexual dysfunction  hot cold waves  nausea  sweating  dry mouth   it's so hard to concentrate at work  and I feel like a zombie once I'm off  Can't wait for it to end     Bear Hug  Hug you harder then you could imagine  And i rub your back with both of my hands  I whisper into your ear one day at a time  Lots of love from me to you xxoo I hope it works out for you  it really helped me a lot  I know it's rough   It has to be really rough for you to go through that   My parents and brother are the only reason why I haven't killed myself yet   I don't want to hurt them   But for god sakes it's fucking hard for me at times   Living is too fucking painful at times   I know that killing myself will make it worse for my family   That's the only reason why I haven't done it  Sad to see you go    What the hell  They need to hire better people  They should only have empathetic people who genuinely want to help people working on suicide hotlines  People who call them are already feeling pretty fragile  They do NOT need someone who is just going to yell at them for being depressed or act indifferent and disinterested  I'm sorry you had to deal with that  Her rude responses were unhelpful but that does not say anything negative about you  You called the hotline for help and they did not deliver  That does not make you a piece of shit or anything  that means they don't know how to do their job  If you ask me  they're the human trash cans in this scenario   I know that people who work suicide hotlines are generally volunteers but the people in charge should take into serious consideration who they allow to take calls  Suicidal people are not something to handle carelessly  I just deleted mines about a week ago it feels sloop good  However I did make a fake account just so I could stay in contact with messenger for a few of my real friends  That way no one will ever find me  Sounds like they dont get paid well and are overworked but its still no reason to treat you like that  Thanks for the advice   Its good to know that it is possible  and what some timelines are     Manitoba here   We'll try engaging with the Moods Disorder Society of Manitoba again  but the last time we tried  they ignored us  didn't answer phones  never called back  Right   I'm surprised he is not banned but I bet it's because he used alt accounts   That is my biggest fear that when I do break down and reach out for help that no one will care  Don't put yourself down because people don't know how to help you  I think most of the ppl at the hotlines are volunteers anyways  Just keep looking for help and perhaps go to the emergency room instead     I calmed down enough to try and callback to report it  I was relived to read that  then     but the person I spoke to that time was even less concerned   If you're up for it  call them again  This is absolutely wrong  And maybe sheds some insight  Nothing is wrong with  you   but there are some circumstances which just make a wrong out of anything  Thank you  I'm happy to not be alone in this situation  You did make me feel better  and you got me on better mood  I wish you a great New Year and I hope that someday we will live a great life  It's not just the gym    Everyone  everywhere is too busy being self conscious to pay a fraction as much attention to you than you think they are   My whole quality of life went up 30  once I realized that   I am sorry for your loss  It must be difficult but remember just because you are diagnosed bipolar does not mean that is why you are struggling  Depression sadness is normal when grieving from the loss of a family member  The blankness you feel could be the sadness you feel from losing someone   The best thing you can do is rely on your support system around you like your mom  Talk talk and talk more  The more you get it out the more you will see you do have people around you who care    Also feel free to continue to post up here as much as you want  There are some great people in these groups who love to listen and provide support and share their own stories and how they have gotten through them    Thanks for putting a bit of light into this glum world   3 For what it's worth  I'm 27 and I'm still afraid of growing up  Everyone you meet is just a kid trying to figure out what the hell happened    I understand though  College allows you to maintain some of the patterns you follow in highschool  you follow a routine that is largely set by others  You have mentors and teachers  You have peers you see everyday  Then one day it abruptly ends and you immediately lose that structure and support  I think some people wind up in grad school purely because they don't know what else to do   A word of advice  drop the guilt about living with your parents for the time being  It's rooted in old fashioned and antiquated ideas that aren't going to be of much use to you  I have a reasonably high paying job now and live on my own  I never would have been able to accomplish what I have without my parents acting as a springboard from time to time   I have a close friend who has lived in a trailer on his parent's property for the last six years or so  Sounds like a real loser right   That's SIX YEARS of rent he's avoided paying with the blessing of his family  He and his girlfriend are going to buy  a house of their own within the next year  He got there by being pragmatic and not caring about what strangers might think of his living situation   As long as you have a goal you shouldn't let it bother you    Have you given any thought about your next goal  Psychosis is a legitimate fear  It happened with my first baby  and worse  I never got it diagnosed  I told everyone I was just a little depressed  So they put me on antidepressants  which just made everything worse  I did eventually get things fixed  but I'll be honest  it took a couple of years to get back to normal    My advice is that you have a comprehensive psych plan before birth  with support people who know when you aren't functional  Also  and this is entirely anecdotal  placenta encapsulation was amazing for me the second time  and I plan to do it again with this baby   My 24th birthday is in 3 days and I'm pretty sure no one will show up  NYE was awful  Christmas even worse  Had my purse stolen in broad daylight the day after Christmas  Going on my third year of singlehood  Unfulfilling job  Lost 30 pounds in the first half of this year and I'm slowly gaining it back  Anything else  Yeah man  Keep going  Have you ever thought about going to the gym  Urghh fuck that then  I deleted Facebook and Twitter a couple of years back and it's one of the few things I look back on with positivity   Very cool artwork and relatable as well    I get carried away with fantasy's too  You should look up maladaptive daydreaming  I like it though  It's a nice escape   Awesome  very good to hear    I know the key is to start small here  But I would suggest going on walks   doing body weight exercises at home  and stretching    Just doing these little things on a daily basis literally take the pain away from lying in bed most days  or sitting at a desk at work  Plus when I am exercising I use it as the part of my day to "think" all of those thoughts that I dont want to think about when I am lying in bed exhausted   All the best lots of love xo Try to do 4 tomorrow  GJ But I'm so scared   It seems everyone I talk to  professional or otherwise  tries to put me down   I know that in order to get better I need to be able to open up but each time I try I regret it so much   I feel really stuck   I truly want to get better   The thought of continuing to make myself vulnerable just sounds like torture    In your case smoking weed is just procrastinating your pain then your problems come back you need to face the hard reality You should throw up and call for help  People can be shit  but they can also be wonderful and you can't live without those fuckers  I shrug and say "I don't know"  they usually chuckle  I don't want to say fine  because I don't feel fine  but I know it's more of a courtesy comment then a real question  Nobody really cares what you feel like if they aren't close to you   Yep  I'm awkward too  guy though   it's all bullshit  In my experience awkwardness just makes you look weird to everyone else  I often lay in bed at night and think about all the shit social experiences I've got myself into  Even when they aren't that bad I still over think them   The first one  it looks like an elastic band nearly  like the heart is going to be ripped into the past leaving no heart for the future  Also  the last hand not clasping on the support one  well        Sad to see another person go    I might check out some podcasts and i didn't know there was a no sleep one  I used to love that sub a couple of years back  It went abit down hill from what I remember but I'll certainty check it out   I did two too out of inspiration or spite  who knows  So thanks  I guess  Couldn't agree more   I love Rick   Morty  futurama and American dad  I can just switch off and enjoy them    There's a few series I like tbf  The inbetweeners  the office  it crowd  But fuck films   I personally don't think it's worth opening up the wound for you or him  If you did hurt him  he probably has gotten over it by now  Your apology might not mean anything to him and it may be painful for you to have to admit the wrong you've done to him  but if it makes you feel better and settles your mind  then go for it  I definitely understand the desire to clear the air   Exchanges like "How are you " "I'm fine  thanks  And you " are just polite talk  which just means it's a social norm established to set another  test  if you will  of your inclusion in the community  You have to know to say the question  and you have to know how to answer  and the exchange tells both of you that you are both part of the same social community via completing these "formalities"   Since it doesn't really mean anything  we spend most of our lives spitting and repeating just as a greeting  not as a real inquiry    But then when someone asks "How are you " and you are NOT fine  the inquiry just draws attention to that fact  Suddenly you are re aware of whatever it is that is making you not fine  and aware that  socially  it's not acceptable to be not fine    I think that's why if feels so bad to tell even that little lie  "How are you " is a matter of inclusion  and when you're not doing so well  you realize how alienated you are   I used to do alot of pot back in my teens  Also done alot of coke too but as I got on abit I thought it was best to leave them behind    Not sure I could smoke weed again  sometimes gets me abit twitchy  I miss stimulants though  The smell  the dripback the fucking rush  Shittt  now I'm craving a gram     You put a smile on my face after I had tears running down it tonight  Thank you for choosing to keep living  I agree with you there is a lot more experiences to be felt during your lifetime  and there are plenty of other drugs to try    Valium Xanax is great   really takes the edge of all the dark thoughts  It makes my problems go away  not sure if thats a bad thing or a good thing but it helps me to keep on living and I am okay with that   Sending you love  I salute you for your courage   It musnt have been easy to end your life  but it would have been harder choosing not to end it and thats why your a hero  xoxo To clarify  of course  there's nothing wrong with using them  You're welcome  Unfortunately I have no experience with Agmatine but from the literature I've read  it appears to exert its antidepressant effect through NMDA signaling inhibition  So maybe a different mechanism from sarcosine but it leads to the same downsteam effects  i agree with Onedayy and as someone who's been in a similar situation  I'd add  be careful not to push her too hard  but if it shouldn't go in the direction you'd like it to go  never blame yourself  I was miserable from 15 to 18  because I was in love with this angel of a girl and she broke up with me and dated my best friend  I'm way older now and let me tell you  that even though it seems unbelievable at this point in your life  she is not the only person who could love you and who you'd be capable of seeing the way you see her now  I just want to tell you that despite things might seem dark and hopeless sometimes in relationships  they're not  still  keeping my fingers crossed for you  either way  life will bring you good things  I'm going through something similar and it's why I'm basically on this subreddit   I only have a small handful of people that I feel are genuine to hang out with   real friends are hard to come by   a lot of people have burnt bridges with me  no longer entertain me  A friend who actually hangs out and who you can have fun with is important  or add anything to my life  I've had to burn bridges with them because they don't have the best intentions for me or their lack of availability and blunt replies just make me feel they don't care   I worry that if I confide in somebody too much about my setbacks and downfalls I will push them away due to people cutting ties with me before  I also have a relationship but my boyfriend lives quite far away from me and we only get to meet every other week   when we do I have a lot of fun and I'm at my happiest not to mention when I do eventually see some other friends   but other than that I'm bored of being in all the time and reaching out to people who are no longer the sort to want to do the exciting things I would plan or who have awkward availability   it's pretty lonely   a lot of things at home irritate me too  it just all feels monotonous and like I'm stuck in the same position and I'm left alone  thinking more about the friendships that didn't work out  people who didn't share my values or who treated me badly  I like that regular company and I want to fill this new year with fun activities but most times I have no option but to stay in and be alone   try to work on myself and find happiness in that even though it can get old and it's not easy due to not being fully satisfied in my environment and to be fair most connections I have just aren't giving me the happiness  fulfillment and companionship I would like and I'm not really sure how to go about making a lot of new ones with similar interests  Man as someone who went out of his way to find the correct pills combo  you're probably not going to die  But good luck  Oh yeah I see  you were saying our measure of time is a social construct  tru tru 7Cups doesn't take calls regarding suicidal ideation intent  Did this once and they instantly apologized but told me to go seek professional help call the suicide hotline instead  I'm guessing it's cause they're not trained to take such calls  Thank you for your advice  I myself have 2 cats that I will sit with when I need it  But personally i feel like talking to an actual person is better  Hope you find a way to deal with your struggles too   Sertralin  My memory got worse  I can't sleep a full night and I concentrate worse on work  It works though  maybe even too well  because I've become kinda indifferent even to things that I believe should piss me off or make me sad  Oh well  Hopefully I'll be off rather soon  You can quit being bipolar anytime you want  It's not real   Love is one of the best experiences you can feel  and heart break is the worst experience you can feel  I  know that feeling you get inside your stomach and you just feel sick  you dont want to eat  your mind is continuously clouded with thoughts and scenarios and what if this  what if that    Im gonna be blunt and sorry if this comes out wrong  but stressing out and worrying will not change the outcome  Change is an inevitable part of life and sometimes it happens for better and for worst  It sounds like your other half is saying reacting to you in a negative tone which is what would spark the feelings you are expressing  and i am sorry to hear that       At the end of the day communication is key with your other half  give her some space   maybe everything is a bit overwhelming for her over there  she's still trying to find her groove  in the mean time focus on yourself   take each day at a time and pat yourself on the back for doing so   From my experience things like this just eat me up and i can't withstand them for to long  If i can start to feel what i have been fearing I will just be straight up with the person and really ask how they are feeling towards me  you might hear some things you might not like but it's the harsh reality of life  The quicker you hear these things  the quicker you can start rebuilding yourself and putting the pieces back together  It wont be easy Im sorry to say  but this is just another test in life  Think of all the hurdles that have been presented to you thus far in life  you got through them didn't you  I wish you the best and please stay strong  life really does go on for better or for worst just focus on one thing at a time  Sending you lots of love and hugs xoxo It depends on the hotline  not the state  All you have to do to comply with that law is say "this line is may be recorded for training and quality assurance purposes " Most companies say that anyway  regardless if the state is one or two party consent   I'm not one to judge  I have free services through my university  I told myself for the longest time I never used them because it would take too much time  an excuse  until my legs trembled the day I decided to head over  I walked somewhere else instead  That I physically couldn't  isn't  an excuse  It's apart of the problem  but not an excuse  It's simply where I'm at   So  I don't use all my resources because I'm afraid  and with reinforcing experiences like this  I don't know how much more scared I would be  I still go to a university club  So  what do you do to try to feel better  Since it sounds like you've tried and dismissed a lot of things  you've probably learned the hard way that building on what you have is pretty much the only way to go    It is impossibly hard when for illnesses like this there's people you're allowed to open up to  and people who can't handle it  It's hard because  literally everybody  tells you to open up  but for different reasons  For some people  it's because they don't want you talking to them anymore  and think opening up to somebody else solves from problem  For some people  like those at the hotline  and they have to sign off on not having depression before working there  they want you to open up to help with the depression  In most cases  this works  In some it doesn't  There's also people who want you to open up because they know that not being allowed to  being to afraid of being vulnerable  is part of the problem  Those are the people who want to help you  depression or not  and don't expect everything to be solved at a snap  I'm pretty sure that that's everybody on this corner of the internet  But  we  all of us here  are people living somewhere  I'm sure that if you continue to be vulnerable  and that's really what opening up  opening up a vulnerability  you'll find a flesh and blood person that wants to help  you     i am so sorry you don't deserve  this nobody deserves this      I know that feeling very well  although in a completely different context  I was bullied by two of my so called 'friends'  And then  the next time I opened up again two years later I got bullied again  You feel stuck  Alone  Worthless  and don't think that you are 'worth it' you know  At a certain point the stress levels got so high that I was having coma fantasies  and was wondering if with the 'correct' dose of toxin I could put myself into one    Now  I fortunately have made some very good friends  and I can even feel positive about myself once in a while  although it still requires some effort   Getting kicked down by professionals  other volunteers at the suicide hotline sucks  The first time I got bullied the school and  my parents set me up with counseling  but I didn't dare open up and didn't accept my suffering yet  As a result and I suspect that the inexperience of the counselor didn't help either  my counselor didn't take me very seriously   Now I've had one session of CBT  and nearly had a combination of a panic attack  emotional meltdown and mental breakdown  And CBT is pretty light as far as therapy goes    but I am improving  I have found a better support group  some good friends  and a psychologist who is really helping me   Sometimes you'll have shit luck at professionals  That sucks  and shouldn't happen  Unfortunately  we don't live in a perfect universe  The fact this subreddit even exists is the proof of that   But there are professionals out there that are worth looking for  Hotlines where there have been few horror stories from  And people whom you can trust  Hey there brother sister   Do not be hesitant to tell your parents  they have been with you since day 1  they have seen everything you have done in life and they will want to give you all the help and love that you need    Those are 2 things that effect those who are severely depressed   affection   and communication  If both of my parents were still alive I wish i could tell them everything from my fears to my accomplishments but i can't and thats why I am so fucked up   Plus my brother committed suicide in novemeber   youre so lucky that you still have your parents  they are there for you no mater what  you will be suprised what they might have to say towards you  Feeling depressed is no joke  once it grips you in its teeth and rips you apart and beats you down where you start to feel so small and insignificant you would have wished you took any chance to tell anyone close to you how you truely felt instead of bottling it all up because thats how i have lived my whole life and i fucken regret not saying shit when i should have    sending you lots of hugs and love xoxo I think it would be worth getting in contact with a superior  somehow  I'm not sure how hotlines work but I'm sure they probably have a website or something  I'm pretty sure the person you initially spoke to could face some repercussions  a suicide hotline shouldn't put those kinds of people in that kind of situation which carries so much responsibility  If you were more vulnerable you could have ended up so much worse now due to her negligence    If she was having a bad day she could have explained that she doesn't feel fit to do her job  given the nature of her job  I'm sure they would understand  As for the other person who you spoke to  if they're her superior they're doing an even worse job by letting this carry on  and I'm sure they have a superior to answer to  I'm not sure who owns or runs hotlines  but they most likely have duties and they are not fulfilling them    Once you're feeling a bit better I'd really encourage looking into this  filing an official report or something  if the phone calls are recorded then this works in your favour    I would just hate the idea of this happening and someone taking it so much more worse than you    I'm sorry this happened to you  that's the last thing that should happen in those services  please please don't think it's your fault  its theirs   deleted                     0 5819      What is this   https   pastebin com 64GuVi2F 93628  Aaand  this is why I will never call a hotline  I hear way to many horror stories on here where the hotline is disinterested and hangs up  It's bullshit that we pass out these numbers like candy without taking the time to see if they're actually helpful   So  you're dad was the one who fought with her  You told your brother  It seems like the majority of your family could have helped her  not just you  And  you thought that if you could get through it  she could  That sounds less like being selfish and more like rationalizing the situation enough that you could deal with it  Maybe it was the only way you could deal with it  Yeah I can sort of relate  I can kind of have a conversation but like you I have nobody  never been able to make friends and when the opportunity of something arose then I'd find a way to avoid it  I don't have the answer because I don't know what to do either but I'm just here  existing sort of  I'm 25 and its weird  in high school I watched people go out  get drunk and talk about it the next day  those same people have advanced through university and are now settling down but I feel the same as I did back then just completely hollow with less to show for it now than I did back then   This is why the only person I do this to  is somebody who knows me well enough to know why I do this  I'd never just randomly do that to somebody  though  That's       why   Thanks for your kind words man  appreciate it  I wish you a great your too  thanke man   That sounds like an amazing center  but your basing off all centers from your experience  There are a lot of centers that are run like a low end job  And there are a lot of "volunteers" that are only there to get something for themselves  whether that be a nice addition to a resume or to help lessen some punishment  And yes  there is training  but it can only help so far  It's really the person that has to be right for the job  and they aren't too many times   Thank you for sharing   I'm in a similar dilemma  as revealing my true persona to other people led to mixed results  I've had friends distance themselves from me when I confessed my depression  For those I haven't told  I remain the 1 dimensional persons that goes gloomy and disappears every now and then   People who truly cared for me before opening up continued to care for me  However  if they are empathetic enough  their new perspective on my motivations and the way I experience things helped them give me more relevant advice  On the flip side  opening up to "normal" people and listening to their response also gave me more points to consider  and sometimes showed me a path where I thought only dead ends exist   It sounds like your husband is truly committed to being there for you  I can assure you it would have been more frustrating for him to see you like that without understanding why  The person he loves and married is still there  even if hidden behind a terrible veil  I sincerely hope you can work it out   Finally  dealing with these crises with other people is not pointless   it can enrich their lives  emotionally  It will give them perspective and a deep basis when they have to deal with similar things on their own  and no "normal" person goes through life without that   They would also have someone to lean on when the time comes    "Bear and endure  This sorrow will one day prove to be for your good "   Do you feel there are not enough jobs to choose from or that there are too many  Do you want anything other than pay from your job  Have you thought about volunteer work  I find asking the right questions and throwing out your first thoughts help to form a flexible and achievable goal  It can be exhausting  constantly trying to find the right answers but when you feel like you and your time is worthless it's not like you're wasting it    if you want any more advice or if you just want to talk please feel free to PM me though I'm bad at replying right away I promise I'll respond as soon as I see it  Have a wonderful day if you can  and remember that although the moon doesn't produce it's own light  it is still beautiful and important  This is so crazy  I've only had face to face therapy for GAD and social anxiety and my therapist was such a lovely lady who was very sweet     I once accidentally walked into her room early and she was eating lunch and she told me she would just be a few minutes   then she spent the first 10 minutes of my session asking how I felt about that situation and telling me that it's okay to feel awkward or embarrassed  you just have to try to not take it to heart and beat myself up about it   It was so sweet because she clearly knew how that situation would make me feel even though neither of us did anything wrong and she handled it very well      I'm sorry you had such a shitty therapist  I wouldn't even know what to do if I had to sit through that  How did they even think that was morally okay   Or post here the number  an hotline like that shouldn't hang up on people       OP  if you want to have a chat send me a PM  I promise I won't hang up      I think that if the only motivation you have is to settle the situation in your mind  you should do it   I think OP needs to just radically accept what has happened and move on  OP do you still want a relationship with this person  Otherwise I see no purpose to this   If OP MUST contact their ex it should be through the smallest of gestures  like an email   You need to accept what happened  how you behaved  what you did  He might not forgive you  but you can forgive accept yourself    Hey  I'd approve the medical leave  But not as  form of self isolation  like it seems might happen here  Maybe talk to the counselor and see if you can't be given class material in your time off  Like long distance course auditing    Take care of yourself first and foremost   They can wait   This is how I feel every someone asks me that question  https   www reddit com r depression comments 5ggohn     No matter how shitty your wage is  if you work in such an environment  hotline for depressed people  you shouldn't morally hang up on people    If you do that  well  you don't deserve a job in a place like that Thank you  Thank you so much  That's solid advice and really helps me  I've been meaning to find a therapist and talk to them  I think that'd do wonders for me  Thank you for caring  I hope deression is soon just a part of your past  3 Thank you  I'll show her the comments is a bit  3 And thank YOU for feeling her art  Hopefully depression is soon in your past  Thank you so much  It's great to know I have people out there who understand  Hi there     I can relate to this too   First of all i fucken love watching twitch streams in bed I watch league of legends what about you       have been doing this for the past 5 years now at first it started off positive no negative vibes  but now its what i do to deal with the pain of being awake or dealing with the anxiety of not being able to leave my house and walk out the front door or untill i can doze off at some ridiculous hour    It sounds like to me that you are experiencing depression  this can be caused by a number of things but you will have a better idea of what then me  I will start by saying that there are a number of small things that you can do to further help yourself one step at a time   First of all you need to stop eating shit food  i know its easy and tasty but cut it out it's not gonna help you on your road to recovery  thats fine if you can only eat a small amount but PLEASE make it real food like fruit or vegetables  nothing too carby   Second of all is to do some sort of exercise  I know your situation and its fucken hard believe me Ive been experiencing this for years now and no one is gonna help you   if you cant help yourself  All you have to do is go for a 10 15 minute walk  let your thoughts run through your mind  you need to strengthen your muscles retrain them to where they once were at  even if you come back and you feel tired thats fine  take a nap you will feel better mentally for going out   trust me  I even found hill running to cure alot of my depression   i would sit at work googling running techniques  "how running cured my depression" and it's amazing  but ill stop ranting about that    third thing is to start doing some strecthing  just youtube yoga lower body back pain  something like that you will find you are getting pain in your legs because the muscles are becoming weak and they are picking up extra slack  an imbalance in the body in other words  a foam roller has saved me for many years of just lying in bed for most days  and doing yoga   24 year old male    Now whatever you are thinking about your life  it is not bad at all  this is the part of the process were you can prevent alot of negative things happening as long as you are pro active in noticing these changes and dealing with them one step at a time  Both my parents passed away at a young age  my brother committed suicide in novemeber and turned my world upside down  I have been mostly a pot head since i was 14 am 24 now  it's better to get help while you can and please take my advice seriously because all i can say is when i was your age and i was starting to feel symptoms like this  it is no where near as bad as what i am feeling on a daily basis now  my god if i could turn back the time to experience the 19 y o me depression trust me i would  but I am not giving up  i am striving to feel that pleasure from daily life that I once felt a long time ago  you are loved by more people then you can think  please get help  do not be afraid to say your thoughts  but remember this you will benefit from natural ways of healing then taking meds believe me  my aunty is a pharmacist and i flew to asia from New Zealand to get Valium to deal with my head after my brothers passing   hope this helps   Lots of love xoxoxoxo I brush my teeth twice a day every day and have been since I was a toddler  it's just mostly habit  I don't feel comfortable going to bed without brushing my teeth first    i just feel dirty otherwise  Thank you  You may be getting a pm from me soon  Happy new year I feel you   I had someone I used to be connected with message me that they missed me and apparently wanted to hang out   I couldn't on one day due to being stuck in bed with a hang over but I made this clear to them and then when I tried to send them messages  call them and add them   they flaked out on my efforts to be a friend without giving me a reason why then blocked me on New Years Eve because I was slightly frustrated by getting no response so basically said 'It seems like nobody is responding to me  so have a good one  peace ' as I was looking for someone to spend that evening with  If it weren't for my other friend who did respond and come down   I would have probably headed back home and spent that evening alone      I'm rarely on FB anymore   I periodically contact friends through messenger and visit a couple of groups   I can't handle the onslaught of fear and hate    What agency was this    If you can find out any information  you can send their name and a report to higher ups in the organization  through email  phone  letter etc  just so they know this person is there and maybe do something about it   PLEASE KEEP TRYING TO GET HELP  If one organization doesn't work  try another  If one therapist is a jerk  try another  because then eventually you'll find the right help  That is was advocating for yourself means  willing to fight for what you deserve  such as humane mental health care   Her behavior does NOT reflect on you and your situation  She only knew you from a few minutes of talking on the phone  how could she be able to judge your life in any accurate way to even say if you're good to bad  She lied to you about one thing so you can't trust her anyway  Her opinion doesn't matter at all   I hope you start feeling better soon and are kind to yourself  My best way to fight off depression is focusing on caring for my whole wellbeing and making sure my body and mind have the best support i can give them   am I eating well   exercising  hanging out with people  sleeping ok  accomplishing anything  meditating  If not  if I improve those aspects  and my mental health inevitably improves    Depressed brain thinks these sound awful  but actually doing them fixes depressed brain  However  it's very hard to go against depressed brain so do not feel bad for being sick and unable to do so   Ex  I let myself eat junkfood when i'm too anxious to cook because i have to eat something  but I know it will hurt my mood if I don't eat well later   Any left over bad feelings I have after doing everything in my power to improve things are beyond my control  and I don't beat myself up for them   Please be kind to yourself  you deserve to not feel this way  3 Hey there  Ontarian here   It took me a good three years of trying to get on disability before I got it     But I was only in my twenties at the time of application so that could be a factor  I was also required to inquire if CPP can pay out any monies  If they can the disability rate will be adjusted   I didn't get it until it was almost too late  After losing my work  the chronic pain from car accidents  losing my vehicle to said accident  state of my relationship  I attempted suicide and ended up in the psych ward for a month  During that month in the hospital the doctors filled out all the forms for me and it was accepted within a week of being sent in  WTF  that perplexed the fuck out of me and kinda made me angry  Docs told me why  my psychiatrist at the time didn't want to give me a diagnosis of a mood disorder  but they had no problem diagnosing me with BP1   Anyways  my suggestion is if your wife needs to fill out her portion to explain what she deals with on the daily  she either leaves it blank  or writes out her very worst days  Hopefully her doc will do the same on their report   Like another poster suggested  a lawyer or advocacy group can also be helpful   Good luck to you both  This is fucked up  I'm glad you're still here though I agree   "How are you " Usually is just Social greeting   Maybe friends and family mean it   Most of the time I just say ok   I do talk to my brother if things are totally off the hook     The other question I hate is " What are you doing these days "  Truth  not much   But  I have to come up with something valid   Ironically  having my therapist ask those questions makes me uncomfortable   He's wanting to know what's happening   It's hard to be vulnerable like that with anyone   I always want to cringe    Him  "How are you "   Me  "Ok "   Him  "Bullshit   How are you really "   Me    cringe     "      uh    "   They're not pretty dumb problems but actually fairly reasonable and serious ones  Japan and Korea have staggering suicide rates because of those kinds of problems  Unfortunately it sounds like you're stuck in a corner as you're still at school and have to live with parents but is there anybody at all for you to talk to  And did posting it help you feel any better  If it did you could post more frequently and we can talk about it all a bit more  I don't know you from Adam but I'd hate for the world to lose you We are two different people  Living in two different places  Thinking very different things  What worked for me  may not work for you      Think about the last thing you did that wasn't "the you that you want to be"  Really think about why you did it  what lead up to it  what was going through your head while it happened and then what you felt afterward  Next time you feel upset by someone  and you feel you need to do something in response that isn't "the you that you want to be" take a moment to make an active choice  will you conform to the past  or change your future right now  If changing your future doesn't sound like the best option then you don't want to change and you should accept that and mold your life to adapt to you  If you can make that change though  then it will be easier the next time  and the next  till one day you find out you are the person you want to be by habit  After that it's only speculation but I think you would be much more content in this world if you could honestly tell people that you like who you are and that others like you  Will you think about doing awful things to the ass holes that infest the surface of our planet  Yes  We all do  But if you can shake that person's hand and have even the worst of people think you're good company  you'll always be the better person  Hawwww man this brought tears to my eyes you bastard     P   I am sending you love and hugs   whatever you are going through my friend keep your head up  take one day at a time and pat yourself on the back when it is over    Life has many ups and downs   trials and tribulations   Now both my parents have passed away when i was a little boy  my brother committed suicide this november  I am 24 years of age    Now whats your fucking excuse   rhetorical   No matter how bad you think your life is   trust me there is alot of other people who are suffering a hell of a lot more  Turn that frown upside down  strive and prosper to be the best version of you    Lots of love xoxo The major problem with this sub is that each post feels like a competition over who is "more depressed"  It's good people can relate to those thoughts and outbursts  but IMO they don't do depressed people much good and if anything reinforce those negative feelings    I've attempted to just start conversations to discuss how we feel from one depressed person to another  but that rarely goes anywhere   TL DR  if you want to reinforce the fact you are depressed then visit r depression   Damn  My loss of interest of everything has taken over  and it feels like a chore to do anything  It's not you  it's them  Trust me  you had no reason to be treated like this  as you said  " Not once did I swear or make a threat or take jabs   ANYTHING like that  I don't know what I did to be treated that way "  The suicide hotline already has a bad reputation  never call them again  I knew they were idiots even though I never called them  FUCK them  You shouldn't ever call them   I know how you feel my friend  what you are experiencing is nothing short of what is called life  it has its ups and downs  joy wouldnt feel so good if it wasnt for pain    remember to take each day one at a time  and at the end of that day pat yourself on the back for doing so  do not be afriad to tell the people around you that you are going through a rough patch  express your emotions communication is key   keep a cool temper  untill you have fully exhausted your means of communicating with people you have nothing to fear my brother   sending love and hugs to you xoxo It's even more sad that I'm going to go out by killing myself  There's no doubt about it  There's being supportive and then there's being judgmental   People here offer feedback   The point behind it is to support each other   I've seen many posts along the lines of "this helped me   Have you tried    "   One of the issues many of us face is feeling isolated and alone in depression   Even having someone else share their experiences can help    Thank you for your kind words  Depression is a daily battle one must not give up   Am trying to spread my wisdom to all of those in this subreddit feeling desperate and unsure where to turn    xoxo I think it's worth apologizing if you think it will help you and your ex  If you think it might hurt someone  don't do it   Good to know  Another reason for me to avoid hotlines  Instead I will call a close friend if I ever get to that stage  Oh    wait    I have no friends    I don't want to sound like a textbook psychiatrist I'm not even remotely qualified  but   I like you  You sound driven but sometimes when you give people one hand  they bite off both  Moving to a new city was something I considered but as you found out  problems seem to just follow you  do you do this hobby with anyone else  Hobbies usually seem to involve other people being reasonably encouraging towards each other  If you feel like having a chat then send along a PM  congratulations on your award by the way In my country a lot of those working on a hotline are volunteers  Im so so sorry to hear of your loss  Grief can be more complex when meshed in with mood disorders  so be kind to yourself  There are no expectations to grief  we all move at our own speed  in our own ways   One person starts off with anger  another with depression  another with laughter  It's ok to feel the way you do  or nothing at all   All you can do is let yourself go through the motions  Talk to people us  If you need someone with you because of self harm suicide try to have other family around    If you visit your local emergency department they most likely have resources for those grieving and can point you to group meetings if thats something you'd be insterested in  Thanks   It will probably help that her pdoc is the one who treated her when she was admitted for her first manic episode    6 weeks in the hospital    and has given a diagnosis of BP with psychotic elements    We can't provide diagnostic advice  but I do want to say that mania is  pretty much by definition  outside off what a normal person might do  Lithium is not bad at all compared to what happens when you're manic  I am lucky to have played with fire so many times and not been burnt  Have had access to alot of valium over the last couple of years only thing is that I have to travel overseas to asia and see my aunty who owns a chemist  despite that she has given me the strongest dose and the amount of 100 in each box  doesnt question me when I ask for 2 boxs also which is like a good 1   years prescription for the average person and ill smash these bad boys in 3 months usually    I know everytime I take these it is taking a part of me that i will never get back  but I must make that sacrifice so that i can feel what humanity i have left  everytime i start running low or know that i need to cut out there is a strict routing that i find very usefull its essentially liek rebuilding yourself  can not neglect the simple things in life   First of all you need to stop eating shit food  i know its easy and tasty but cut it out it's not gonna help you on your road to recovery  thats fine if you can only eat a small amount but PLEASE make it real food like fruit or vegetables  nothing too carby  Second of all is to do some sort of exercise  I know your situation and its fucken hard believe me Ive

You clearly don't understand how texting works  If you want to speak to them fucking call them  How the fuck do they go about their lives knowing that they could've killed someone  Taking it day by day I hope your year gets better  You aren't garbage  and someone out there loves you I know it   Wonderful  I'm sorry that you're going through this  As much as I thought about it the pre recorded workout programs didn't cross my mind  Thank you so much for dropping the workout plans suggestions  saves me a ton of time as now I have a place to start looking from    Equipment seems to be managable  I am glad that I rent a big apartment albeit from what you tipped me to it seems that it is quite easy to start off  Thanks   a lot   for spending your time writing it  Gave me a nice kick and a lot of hope    yep    i suck at making new friendships  mainly only meet people through my social friends that i do have You are welcome  I am glad to help Both my parents passed away at a young age  my brother committed suicide in novemeber and turned my world upside down  Believe me when I say things get better  there was a time in my life even when my parents were gone were i found peace and tranquility in a daily basis   such as yourself I was gifted and excelled at studies  but my grades started to slip as life threw more curveballs at me and my parents were no longer with me to help me through them    what are your hobbies  are you into computers  music  instruments  sports   Do you smoke pot  have been smoking pot since i was 14   am 24 now  i remember the first time i tried it  and it suddenly just made everything better  thats the only way that I could really explain it to people  it just made the boring less boring  and the pain less painfull  call it escapism  but it help me to get as far as i am now  and to be the caring thoughtfull person that i am    Sending you love and hugs xoxo  I wasn't trying to be a dick or anything  I was just saying scary things can happen when we don't take care of our teeth  I totally understand where you're coming from  I really do  Hygiene can be really hard to manage with depression  My family member dying has given me a bit of a push to stay on top of my teeth  It's scary   i smoked weed since i was 14  now 23  i smoked about half oz a week  every day  through a bong  mixed with tobacco  id say i was very anxious and a bit depressed before i started but yeah hard to say  felt like ive been smoking my whole life  Yeah it seems to run in cycles and I'm not sure why  Last week I started cleaning and thought yeah I'll blitz this place and have a great summer but it ends up sinking me a few days later and I end up sitting in the shower with my eyes closed wishing it all away     If I STAY in bed  whether from hangover  depression  or both  I think I'm going to "sleep myself better" but in fact it never fucking happens  So I have to admit   after years of this shit   that I am wrong   I do this very thing all the time  I did it just this morning  actually  It took me a few hours of a pity party to admit that it wasn't working  So off I went   I defiitely understand not feeling any different than I did back in high school  That's actually when all my problems started  I guess I wasn't self aware enough of my problems to be one of those depressed awkward teens that got help  I was always satisfied with what I now understand were simply distractions from life  I actually transformed from depressed nobody to deadbeat loser stoner and knowing that's how I'm seen by most people who know me is a particulary harsh reality to have to come to terms with  What's funny is that every time that happens I think to myself "maybe I was not ill  I was probably just lying to myself  I was just really sad  I'm not ill  because I feel ok now  I still feel a little weird  I feel on the inside  something  but I'm okay  not ill  I was just making it all up"    That is what I think  every time  and then it comes back in full force and I do not know what to believe in anymore  I am not sure if I am just sad often majority of my life or if I am ill of depression  I don't know  I may be lying to myself to make my failures in life easier  excuses  but I just don't know anymore  the line kinda blurs and I can't trust myself anymore   This circle is just really screwing it up  I cannot tell anymore if I'm getting better  worse or if I am still the same or if I am okay and I am just making it all up in my head  it's unclear  People need to stop judging  Seriously  So true    Not pathetic you sound victim to a series of circumstances out with your control and it's tearing you up  I don't think I can help or offer advice but I'm genuinely wishing you all the best for 2017 and I hope you hang in there  don't hate yourself because of other people's feelings towards who you are or unrequited love  my man  you do not need to compare yourself to others  this is where your line of thoughts plague your mind  there is nothing wrong with how many times you have been on a date  or whether your social media is popping off  fuck that shit  doesnt mean shit  you know why  because social media is some stupid bull shit where you see a photo of someone who supposedly likes you if its tinder  and a robot like generated message with an opening line  i know plenty of dudes who are good looking that still get 0 off that sort of stuff so stop cutting yourself short and comparing yourself to others   your future wife is probably thinking the same thing right now to her self   did you ever think that  when your dad was your age he was living in a different time  that was the norm to get married at a young age and settle down  it's an option but its not your only option remember that   We are all unique   I lost my virginity when i was 14   went out with that girl for 3 years  met the love of my life for 1 year  then had a bunch of flings with not so important girls but i can recall loving these girls because they were so beautiful  i havent had sex in 5 years since I was 19  yeah call it depression or not giving a fuck  but i know when the time is right it will happen naturally I am training myself to find someone who i can see the qualities i have in me in them also  which is hard to find in this day and age of time were everyone is so retarded from social media    think of it this way bro  girls are fucken trouble  do you want to experience what its like having a GF and she goes out clubbing with other girls and guys  and she gets shit faced drunk   youll be staying up all night texting her and youll never really know what shes doing behind your back  thats the reality of dating these days   i know this from experience because I was the one doing shit behind the girls back cause i was greedy and selfish   xoxo   It's just a "try it and see "  To be fair  AAPs are a serious type of medication class  Last time my doc told me to 'try and see' an AAP  I got a side effect never heard of  I got focal dystonia  akathisia  and dysphonia  I lost my voice  reduced to a whisper for a good six months  lost my job  my hobbies  my life  Had to do speech therapy just so I can communicate effectively again  Almost two years later I still struggle with my speech  let alone the dystonia   Yea I was experiencing signs of psychosis but honestly my life is now worse off than it was before trying the med  These are meds that can cause permanent and severe types of side effects  Thats a lot to ask for a patient to accept  I like it  sorry for this disease we all share that's made you feel this way but you're good at shaping it  Only if it will make you feel better or move forward  Ex has already figured out your behavior for themselves and made their own assumptions about it  It wouldn't hurt too bad to just say something like "Hey I'm doing better with bipolar now and I just wanted to say that  stuff that happened  was because I was not well  I wasn't in control of my behavior because I was having an episode but I wanted to apologize anyway  Sorry I  did whatever I did  "    Once I was stable I apologized to my ex husband  He accepted that my behavior was because of a condition and accepted the apology  He also apologized for some of his behaviors that led to the divorce   no matter what  bipolar or not  it takes TWO people to end something  We had a long talk about why we didn't work out  like a 4 hour one  In the end he did make it very clear that a relationship was not possible again because he couldn't take the risk of going through all that again  I said I wasn't looking for that and we finally moved on with our lives and we haven't spoken again  This conversation was 2 years after the divorce   thanks    nice to know im not the only one  i also get a few valium  handful at a time prescribed by doctor  and they make me feel so great  i wish i could be on that valium high all the time  but they can be very addictive so i hope you're careful with them    i am gunna try to keep pushing through without weed  psychs are poxy  last one i went to told me to look in the mirror and say "i love you" and dumb shit like that   self confidence wasn't even my issue at the time  anyways best of luck thx again for your comment    xo Thanks I ll try my best  HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU SIR    How old are we today   Sorry to hear you are having troubles with your friends  it happens  blame social media its fucken made everyone dumb   heres a quick solution  dont text them  RING THEM  you will get an honest answer from their mouth hopefully it is a positive one    or see or ask them in person to hang out    all the best xoxo I have the most addictive personality  i toked a joint last night and all i could think of is MORE MORE MORE   i think i should stay off the shit  cheers What are you doing these days slays me  it's like an instant conversation killer that screws with your mood I am sorry to hear this one of the worst things a child can experience is their parent not being able to see eye to eye   You know what  fuck em  if they cant see your point of view  why should you keep caring  just ignore them  or just say what you need to say without putting up a fit   please do not say you are going to jump off a cliff  over this  cmon   both my parents died of cancer and i watched them when i was 14 years old  my brother committed suicide last november at the age of 24  life throws a lot of curve balls  some we can deal with   others we must run from and seek refuge untill the pain goes away  if it goes away  life has so much more to offer you   please do not take that for granted  not everyone will see eye to eye as you and that is the beauty of your soul  lots of love and hugs to you xoxoxoxo Sounds less like a need to control your ambitions and more a need to plan out and follow through with them    take some risks  roll the dice  you might just find you can achieve what you dream  I think that's a good goal   Become a cashier  I did and it's an easy job for being depressed for me  You work alone at the till but you have coworkers  You do some small talk with customers but they always leave you alone once they paid    I think only you know your relationship with your ex and what you want to come out of it  There's probably no need to go in and re hash anything specifically hurtful  but apologies go a long way  Even if the other person has already compartmentalized your actions in the past  if they heard from you that you were sincerely sorry and wish them the best in the future  it may help them re close those memories with a happier tone    I've personally gone back and apologized to friends from many years ago in school for my previous actions  It may have been selfish on my end initially because I wanted to fix things  but I have made amends with those people and have built a whole new adult friendship with them    Good luck with however you move forward  fuck reddits shitty formatting Thanks but I most certainly am garbage  and nobody loves me and my year probably won't get better   Well stated   Yep absolutely  I'm surprised how many posts share my feelings in a world where people look at me like I'm some sort of outcast criminal  Honestly  when I'm hanging out with them I still enjoy what they have to say  we have the same taste in movies and music and they are really funny  it's just I cannot muster up the confidence to try to crack a joke or even contribute to the conversation  They are good friends and they have tried to put up with me  but nobody wants to hang out with the kid who has nothing to say ever  Fantastic  I know everytime I take these it is taking a part of me that i will never get back  but I must make that sacrifice so that i can feel what humanity i have left  everytime i start running low or know that i need to cut out there is a strict routing that i find very usefull its essentially likd rebuilding yourself  can not neglect the simple things in life   Glad to hear that you are going to keep pushing through brother  it wont be easy  but at the end of it think of how amazingly strong you will be  then you can help others that will be in the situation that you were once in how amazing of a gift is that   That psychiatrist sounds fucken stupid  that is not going to solve anything  Getting to the root of any problem is a place to start what a load of crock   you just have to keep at it man  dont give up   just dont  would love to hear from you in the future    xoxo This is not on you  Sometimes I internalize blame when someone does me wrong  but that is another habit that contributes to depression  The people working at that hotline clearly don't have appropriate training and lack empathy  It says nothing about you  nothing  light at the end of the tunnel even for the worst of us   3 good work brutha  you sound like one strong mf  I feel like that a lot  I still do things though and push through  Sometimes it helps and I feel a bit motivated but sometimes it doesn't   at least a few chores get done and I feel less shitty about it   I'm looking for these also   I was diagnosed back in 1997 and have since tried to "man up" about it but I've been in a suicidal state for the past 10 years at least as I hate meds   I'm not even sure why I'm still here  but I'm still fighting   I wish the best for everyone and please know you don't suffer alone and hang in there   I just recently lost my job and I'm on the verge of being homeless   I honestly don't know where I can get help here in AZ    I hated myself for a long time because I was ashamed of the things I did as a kid  I also had a heap of Catholic guilt which made me so unhappy with myself  I was also fat  I did the ol' pros cons lists  I fixed a few things but I'm not in love with myself  I barely like myself but at least I'm not hating myself    I do a gratitude and courageous acts lists daily  if I can but it's usually pretty sporadic  Maybe we can both try a 'things I like about myself" list   I second this  Writing down your thoughts will help you organize them  I would try yoga or reading to help calm your mind   First  I want to address the gun thing  I don't have the means to get one as easily as you do  but I totally have fantasies about blowing my head apart with a shotgun  and being perfectly fine with it  right then and there throughout the day  I totally get having that nagging  grim solution pop into your head all the time  It's important that you continue to fight this urge  Now  clearly  like me  you aren't feeling good about your lifestyle  Well  from one stoner to another  let me tell you that quitting marijuana for good or at least a very long time is going to help improve your situation drastically  This isn't a new idea for you  I'm sure  but it is without a doubt the best thing for your health right now  You'll be in better shape for not smoking  feel a lot less sorry for yourself   probably  begin to feel better sober  and feel sharper  depression weed habit  major brain fog   Same goes for porn  except thaf you should give that shit up for good  If it hasn't made you sexually impotent with a women yet  it will eventually  Smoking you can pick back up once you feel your life coming back together  happy people smoke all the time  enjoy it more  and do it more responsibly  i e  not all the time  and at more appropriate times     The last thing I wanted to add is excercise a lot more and eat better  You said you were in decent shape  Get in fucking GREAT shape  Run a mile everyday  be able to do 100 pushups in a sitting  pull ups even  Be able to swim a mile or more straight  I find fitness goals particularly rewarding  and I barely feel anything at all  emotionally  99 99  of the time  Fuckin A right  Being socially awkward anxious might as well be a death sentence  where you're expected to do the killing   Thanks a ton    Thanks a lot buddy     Thank you for your advice  It's good to know that running has helped you so much  Working out helped me a lot way back  but I had a bad experience with a friend and now whenever I go to the gym and lift I think of him  It used to be so positive  and now it makes me feel anxious and think of things I should have left behind      What you said kind of scared me in a way  I can believe that this kind of depression maybe isn't so bad  I've only felt real internally generated pain once in recent memory  and that was so bad I was sleeping to get away from it  Now  I'm coasting  and the worst I see of it is when I try and get off the antidepressants and see what things look like "under the bandages" as it were    Turns out  not great  Not as bad as it was at its worst  but I'm not better    I feel like I'm mostly "treated"  but the antidepressants are working less and less well as I get lazier about my lifestyle  I'm becoming more insular and homebound  and I have less time for people winding me up or being generally annoying  That scares me and I want to stop relying on the meds before they stop working completely  Guess I can't  though    I hope I can make lifting work for me again  I know the person who hurt me never meant to make me give up  I took up running like you  but it's hard when the roads are icy    Sheesh    Minds like raw eggs  the least little thing can put a crack in them  Do you find you're kind of weirdly tough in some ways  yet so easy to mess with in others  What I hate is when you can't hide your depression from other people due to your body language  so they actually do kind of mean "how are you" in a slightly concerned sort of way  It's like fuck now I've attracted someone else's pity  which I fuckin hate   There is nothing your doctor hasn't heard before  Tell them what you've just said here and be as honest as you can be  I hope you are able to get some help  Last time I was off for any length of time  I lost my job  Took me an afternoon  Arrived at work  got more and more down  a customer picked on me for looking down  and I snapped at her  Fired   Honestly don't let that get you down   Some people there suck ass   So what   Just keep calling until you find a calm nice person   Also  only limit your talking to 10 min   Then they start getting mean   They try to rush you off the phone  I love music and it makes me feel better  There's so much I could write down  Unfortunately  I don't recognise anything you mentioned   I YouTube'd surrenderdorothy  Makes me think of radiohead mixed with brand new  I like the lo fi and voice overs    I like listening to music I can sing with or stuff I grew up listening to  It's nostalgic  Like Taking Back Sunday  Bright Eyes  Minus the Bear   Just do weed at night so that you won't be under the influence for a job in the day   Weed is amazing   I hope you don't have to give it up completely   I personally use indica edibles to sleep   It feels so great   That's shitty  I've been having a lot of up and down days recently because of my "fuck these pills" attitude and being in the military just makes things a lot worse  I fell in love with my best friend  She didn't feel the same  It's such a shame  the person I'm talking about is truly a wonderful and loyal person    As far as I know  they're not drinking or smoking  Their body doesn't allow them to  they would vomit it out by the second they drink  It's just them and their loneliness  although they were tempted  Making the goals instead of ambitions  The method I learned in school was make goals specific  measurable  achievable  realistic  and timely    I daydream a lot and I get all these great ideas and plan things out but then I have to work at superstore and they get swept away    I have to give myself reality checks  Like  "hey I know you like animals but you're never going to have a giant farm  become a veterinarian  and have a hugely successful animal rescue business  It was a cool idea but you have to calm down and go to sleep" If weed was legitimately the source of your problems then I'd say no  Honestly my opinion is that you shouldn't smoke if you aren't already legitimately happy  You already quit  and if your anything like me  it will rapidly become the habit it used to be  I need to stop but I can't because  like with a lot of other people here  at least I feel SOMETHING when high  I guess "can't" is an overstatement but it's fuckin hard to let go of when you're depressed   I would ask him why the hesitancy to change the formal diagnosis   If you are being treated with Bipolar meds and they are effective  then ergo you are Bipolar right   As far as I know  you don't treat depression and GAD with lamictal   It is possible he doesn't want to change it from depression and GAD to Bipolar until he can narrow down where on the spectrum you are  I  II  NOS  cyclothymic     In the end though you are right in that it matters less what "label" he gives you and more that the treatment is effective    Actually yes  my great grandfather was arrested and killed by communists and his family my grandfather was 7 then  was deported to Siberia   Here  https   en wikipedia org wiki Soviet repressions of Polish citizens  193946   is an article about it  under mass deportations to East   I don't think that's very good for your health tbh Goodnight brother Most nights I am kept awake by all the embarrassing things I've done and horrible imaginations of people turning on me  I too have a artificial Christmas tree that looks pretty in the dark  It makes me feel a warm glow of christmas y cheer   ive never taken anti depressants im sorry that i cannot help you in that area  but I'm sure that you are noticing the effects that they are having on you and im glad that you are trying to better yourself in this situation  pat yourself on the back    I know what its like to stay at home   heck points in my life I wouldnt leave my home for weeks  maybe months at a time  Recently I wouldnt even walk down the street to go to the shops unless one my of my flat mates came with me  i just dont like being alone i guess or maybe people wont notice me as much if im not by myself social anxiety i guess  but i can comfortably run across to the road and up the hill for some exercise with out caring  funny that   Of course they never meant to make you give up   or even cause that degree of pain  dont let old memories ruin you trying to better yourself because its one of the only options you have  its like the thought of the gym is actually worst then going to the gym  once youre there it's manageable  maybe give yourself 10 minutes on cardio equipment  if you make it past the 10  do another 10  if you make it to 20 minutes and youre feeling good   stay for another 10  small increments at a time is a good place to start  I just feel huge amounts of anxiety being in public places  especially the gym which is stupid but once my blood starts pumping i dont want to leave its all about just tricking my brain that nothing bad is gonna happen    I find I take things too personally   some of my friends are rather blunt then  and it feels like they are attacking me with some of the things they say  in reality they arent attacking me they are treating me the same as all of their other friends its just my warped perception makes me feel hurt  i dont like confrontation  definitely weridly tough  you have to be mate  living in the world we live in  but so susceptible in many ways too   lots of love  i used to smoke only after work  but when i wasn't working i was always high  i found it gradually killed my motivation for working  yeah it sucks when you're already in a bad place to quit  thought it would help my life but eh  too late i guess  i toke a joint and all i can think of is smoking a bong   addictive personality I did that once it turned out bad I'm not very friendly when I'm down   Food is my go to feel good thing but it pains me because I'm on a strict budget and trying to maintain my weight  I have unsuccessfully coped with buying other stupid things I don't need  too much cannabis  and gaming  I've gone to buy junk food at superstore many times and stared at the stuff I want to buy but always have to walk out empty handed and more sad  Why can't food stop giving me pleasure  The ones I tried all bored me after a while  but I'll definitely give the ones you suggested a try   Maybe they're better    Honestly  despite having never tried medication  I have zero faith in it as far as healing my issues goes  and what you wrote above exemplifies one of the reasons why  The only advice I have for you is to get your emotions under control on your own  I have a tendency to lash out at others and regret it later too  I find meditating at least two times a day for 15  minutes useful because it helps you stay mindful of your state of being and your surroundings in the face of depression  Once you're mindful you can work on externalizing your issues in healthy ways when necessary  talking through negative emotions  if you want to find it necessary   instead if unhealthy ways like cathartically lashing out at people  Just want you to know I care and that this won't be easy  i used to go  but my energy levels have been so low and fatigue so high that i cant think of it at the moment  i want to increase my activity levels    may b then one day   whtever rings your bell    You and me both  Every day is waiting to end into another day to try and make it through without sobbing in the corner telling yourself all the terrible dark thoughts no one deserves to think   ty    I have been on Prozac  20 mg  for about three or four months and I feel a lot better  I still feel the depressed sometimes  but it's better than before  The only side effects I generally feel are dizziness or feeling faint  Every other possible side effect of Prozac has decreased since my body has become used to it  good idea Happy birthday  Prozac made me suicidal  it's not for everyone  Don't give up on meds if you have depression because they do work  I'd be dead without them  If you want to talk to a bored anonymous soul  I'm here lol  I don't think you're that dumb if you consistently use three periods to create thought breaks and do so in a seamless method  It's quite well written  Reminds of Mordin from Mass Effect 2   Maybe start embracing your traits instead of condemning them for not being the social norm  Go wild like Danny DeVito  He's pretty much what you described    Can you get some help  It sounds like everything is out of control and you can't deal with it all on your own  Or maybe you can  but it'd be really fucking hard  Which is understandable  If it's not easy to talk about it maybe bring a note explaining things  Maybe print off this post and show it to your doctor    both my psychologists are on vacation because of holidays and it is a bit sucky tbh  also i got really self destructive and did some stupid things but i don't know how to fix it and i don't really care  i keep doing all these destructive things and i never tell anyone and it's dumb but it makes me feel like i have some control   and it's not anything they ask about in that way because it's not my self harm issues and it's not drugs so i don't even need to lie to not talk about it  and telling them or anyone else about it would make me feel so fucking pathetic and messed up and just like a fucking faker so nah   i don't know what to do about anything  i guess i'll just lie in my room doing nothing until school starts on monday and i see my therapist the wednesday after that  great    So sorry to hear that  the holidays can be really difficult when you're alone  We have found these things can help not just with loneliness during the holiday but all year round   http   blog tranqool com 2016 12 07 5 tips avoid feeling lonely holidays  Sorry to say  texting is not for that kind of serious discourse  Reddit  Sure  Texting people  Not so much  Even being an understanding person with major issues  I'd easily get annoyed by that sort of text  Like someone else said  if you need to actually DISCUSS something with someone  just call them  Big part of the problem is that texting isn't used for that kind of communication for 80  of people  for myriad good  valid reasons  I'm sorry you went through that  They're flawed humans just like the rest of us  I was on hold for 30 minutes once  I've had a similar "hung up" experience where I was invalidated and sent home from the ER when I was suicidal  It would be so nice if there actually were a reliable crisis system  Professionals act like the hotline or the ER are going to cure everything  but people are dumb and that's the moral of life  unfortunately  At the moment  I'd be happy to be diagnosed as a green martian  if it got me setup on those three meds   Still not a bad idea to ask why if you're curious  Ahhh  christ  That's got to really suck  I guess you're not able to be open about it  I mean  I'm not open with people around me unless I know them pretty well  but I heard of people getting kicked out  at least out of basic training  for stuff like that  hell yeah  my exercise routine tens to be that small sometimes  but if its all i can manage I am fucking proud Yeah  I am pretty much the same  I just don't care that much  My BF was super excited about my graduation and all I could muster was "yeah  I did it  It's not like it was hard or long "  that's what she said   A lot of my not caring is depression talking and I think the rest is just being mindful and in the present moment  I don't think too far ahead and just try to be as stoic as possible because attachment leads to suffering and I have a really hard time dealing with emotions   A lot of people tend to self diagnose with depression which is very difficult to do  Really depression is a very complicated mental illness and there are so many types  Regardless if you are not happy where you are in life getting help will help you achieve your goals  This is a really good summary of the types of help available  http   blog tranqool com 2016 04 11 what are the different types of mental health service providers  You must be your whole world for no one can be your island paradise   Find the 8 brocades by Mimi on YouTube  it's a great series of gentle exercises you can do your whole life  No  we were hanging out and actually chatting most of the night  then at about 5 to 12 I see her in the arms of my friends cousin  they make out at midnight and I spend the rest of my night on my phone  That is fair  I agree that there are potential long term risks to really any meds  but especially anti psychotics of any type  The earlier you catch them  the less likely they are to be permanent  but the risks exist and it isn't fair to pretend that they don't   I would also agree that some side effects can make your quality of life so miserable that the benefit to mood or psych symptoms isn't worth it  The problem is  since side effects and benefit is so specific to each individual  it's impossible to know ahead of time what that balance will be for someone    I will be honest  In my case  the side effect profile of clozaril was not worth the benefit  I was taking it for bipolar disorder that literally does not respond to any medication that I have tried  My moods shift  while not frequently  they do and the depths of the depressions in particular become dangerous at times  The idea was the clozaril may prevent that  The side effects made my qualify of life suck which made me depressed anyway and it was another drug that didn't work    Since every drug I've tried either sends me to the ER  gets me admitted into the medical hospital due to horrific side effects  or simply does nothing  I really don't feel like I'm a good example of any experience with any drug   That being said  someone else who experiences symptoms of outright psychosis might have had the exact side effects I had and made the decision that they were worth the trade off  That person could decide that not having psychosis is better than the other things  For me depression was not enough  Especially depression that wasn't relenting anyway    It's all about where you are at  what things you value  what your personal tolerances are  etc   Some people can handle a lot of side effects if their mood levels out  Others want nothing to do with side effects at all and would rather be all over the place than have physical consequences of anything  It is a very personal decision   Edit  on mobile and trying to fix typos  Forgive the ones I missed  XD can you imagine someone replaying  "Aww actually I'm so fucked up  I've been thinking about the best suicide methods  and how are you    "  No  they definitely don't wanna hear the real answer    Btw you know who's your real friend  as they never ask that question  because they know how are you  better then you do    Seems like you're going through a really stressful time and are taking it all upon yourself  Leaving college is not a forever situation  you can always return in the future  Don't think this is the end  You clearly enjoy working out so maybe try incorporating that into your routine  I can be really hard to start but once you make it a habit you will stick with it  Exercise also has some awesome benefits for your mental health  Here are some ideas to make it less overwhelming  http   blog tranqool com 2016 10 31 5 tips for making exercise less overwhelming  Your English is great  The grammar was good  a few run on sentences but that's hard to avoid    I truly believed I would be the same miserable I was at 14  Time  a lot of time  literally over a decade  has passed and things have improved  I'm not miserable anymore  I'm not super happy but I'm fairly content  Learning to let things and not involve yourself in other people problems  Like any other service  even suicide hotlines have employees who couldn't be arsed to do their job right  Please just come to reddit if you need help  it might take a little longer to get a response  but people here go through the same situations  and we can help each other out more than we think  One thing is clear OP   this is not on you   There's nothing wrong with you  you're definitely not beyond help  and you're worth more than you know  That's awesome  exercise can have such an amazing impact on mental health  Keep fighting and if you need some help making it seem less overwhelming maybe try some of these tips  http   blog tranqool com 2016 10 31 5 tips for making exercise less overwhelming  Hey  you are sixteen years old so do not worry that you do not have everything figured out  I would suggest giving college a try because college is not only a place to learn but a place to meet new people and discover new interests   And if you decide to change your major  so be it  I went to school with a girl who studied engineering with me for two years then switched to public relations and is really successful   So definitely try new things while you are studying and be open to new opportunities  And have fun  you're sixteen so you have your whole life ahead of you   Side note  most people throughout their teens and twenties thought they had it all figured out and I think that part of becoming an adult is realizing that no one really has 'everything' figured out because life is going to throw some curve balls at you  push ups are really hard to do  are you going to go for 3 tomorrow    I have depression and I sometimes use this sub to vent  However  even I sometimes find it to be too negative depressing  so I hardly ever post here  Doesn't mean it's a bad thing  it's just the nature of this sub  A place for people to vent is going to be full of negativity   If you don't find any problems with it  that's great  But don't act like this is some kind of echo chamber safe space where no form of criticism or disagreement is ever allowed  You're just feeding into the stream of negativity yourself  Do you have a primary care doctor  What I did was I told my doctor I was feeling depressed  and they referred me to a psychiatrist   Birth control pills Have been linked to depression so that could be a factor   Fastest relief would be AMPA activation   Ketamine  Agmatine  Sarcosine  or Psilocybin mushrooms  Yes I do  I think I will make an appointment this week  Thank you   Yes I do  I think I will make an appointment this week  Thank you   Holy shit  I searched up "M 59 Fifty Grand   Scary All Over" and I absolutely love it  Do you have any more songs like that  It took me a long time to get the courage to talk to my doctor  and then to actually make an appointment when I got a referral  I just told my doctor I thought I was depressed  They asked why and I explained what I was feeling and they gave me a referralto a psychiatrist   It was hard to open up but I just had to grin and bear it  If you have a friend or family member you trust and who knows what's going on  you could bring them along to the appointment if that might help   In the words of the ever long Vincent   "The sadness will last forever "  Your words were beautiful and poetic  It only gets me frustrated really  Best thing for me to do is avoid people so I can avoid getting hurt  What's wrong with THEM   It's fucking irresponsible  It's their job  to listen and try to understand people without judging them  If they can't handle people with problems  it's their failure  they should do something else    Don't let them bring you down  it's not your fault  Good  Please come back and let us know how it goes  I know for me it's hard to open up to people so I just had to sort of grit my teeth and blurt it out  I would only recommend smoking after accomplishing five goals for the day  Having nothing to do is incredibly depressing  Being stoned when you've done nothing all day is really depressing  I like to reward myself with cannabis after getting work  chores  and personal grooming done   Yeah  that's pretty much depression  I always comment with this

say I'm doing fine  I hate lying but people don't really care about me anyways  Honestly he genuinely thought he was connecting with me through it  I laughed politely along with the jokes  It wasn't til I talked to a friend support person about it that I realized it had made me shut down emotionally  I recounted it like an abuse victim  I know cause I am an abuse victim   underselling it and saying it was just kind of weird and I wasn't sure how I felt about it and only connecting with how it made me feel when my friend was raging about it and telling me to never go see him again   I had always heard that therapy was a place to open up so I made the effort  A critical point in my abuse story hinged on my parents breaking into a locked box in my bedroom while I was out of town and searching through my things  I was 21 at the time   They found out about some fairly innocent sexual interests habits  made an insane logical leap and accused me of being a predatory child molester  I was  and still am  an extremely vocal advocate for victims of child sex abuse and education prevention of CSA  a behavior my parents classified under the vast umbrella of me being "too sensitive"    This was only our second session but I was worried that if I withheld any information in this story that it might leave room for doubt in my version of events and make him think I was hiding the truth that I really did have pedophilic tendencies  So I told him in detail  the incredibly personal  private and totally harmless sexual interests that my parents learned about me   He agreed that my parents' accusations were ridiculous and manipulative  but he became fixated on these very personal things I'd told him  I had always assumed that it's part of being a therapist that even if you're completely shocked by something  you react calmly to it and explore it with your client neutrally  This guy did the exact opposite  He treated the things I had told him  things that are well known and studied in the field of psychology and shared by millions of people around the world  as if he had discovered a strange new form of mental deviation  He was fascinated and made sure the rest of the session revolved around this topic   He reacted like you might react to your best friend saying they were abducted by aliens who speak French  wear lederhosen and exclusively drive 2003 Dodge Durangos  wanting to engage and be supportive but dumbfounded by the ridiculousness of it and unable to keep from being patronizing while discussing it because you can't say "do the aliens choose 2003 Durangos for the features or did they just get a bunch of them randomly " while keeping a straight face  This was the tone of the conversation we had   He asked suppositional questions about it like I was a specimen to dissect  even when I repeatedly tried to change the subject  I felt like he wanted to publish some paper on me entitled "sexual freaks  they walk among us"  He kept making jokes about it  repeatedly stating he likes to use humor to approach awkward subjects  He did say there was nothing wrong with it  as he literally stifled laughter  with the implied air of "some people live in abandoned lighthouses  shampoo their hair with peanut butter and fall in love with paper clips  I'm not gonna tell you to stop being a fucking weirdo"   He connected the fact that I was a 24 year old virgin and hadn't been involved with anyone romantically since I was 16 not to my trauma from abuse  self hatred and crippling anxiety  but rather because I was stuck using my unconventional sexuality as a coping mechanism  and made jokes about how no woman would ever be interested in someone who does these sorts of things  Half jokingly  he advised me to never let anyone I might date know about them    He ended the session by saying that he looked forward to discussing this more  not my abuse trauma or my disastrous executive function or my paralyzing anxiety  but specifically this topic  stating this in a euphemistic way that cracked another joke about it   He said our goal moving forward would be to help me transition from these interests to an "actual girl"  The way he phrased it very strongly implied vaginal intercourse  despite the fact that he knew at the time I was practicing abstinence   Every mental health professional I've ever told this story has been horrified  My current therapist is near impossible to shock  and even she got visibly angry when I recounted it to her  It was one of the most violating experiences of my life  and I'm glad I wrote it out since it's really the first time I've gotten all my feelings and recollections of it out in one go  I am a great believer in asking for forgiveness when you think you have wronged someone and making peace  But be prepared in case you get rejected or they are not willing to forgive you  But at the same time  it's been a while since you saw him her   sometimes it's best to leave sleeping dogs lie    Only you know the right answer for you   If you're still friends it's completely acceptable to text him  Don't go overboard with a million texts but let him know you're feeling lost and down and want to talk to someone   Thank you  I appreciate it  I will try to make the best of every situation and it will probably get better in the future  I use to be addicted to painkillers as a teenager  I overdose a couple of times too  Didn't matter how many I took as I still woke up in the morning  If you feeling suicidal its better to get help and talk to someone  you only gonna make yourself sick with those pills    Man  that sucks  Sounds like a really heavy semester with six classes  That sucks man  girl problems are the worst  These things fuck me up the most  ty for this I think it's more common with anxiety and being self conscious    I don't really care what people are talking about  I don't even care if they are talking about me  My bf has anxiety problems and he thinks people are giving him the evil eye  talking about him  sizing him up  and becomes paranoid in crowds when alone  Yeah and i was actually feeling really good that night aswell Same  I have all the things a girl could need  except a car  but still just feel like doing nothing all day   Damn i never thought i'd see someone with a similar taste in music as me  I'm a big fan of teamSESH and Bones  Have you listened to SadlyThatsJustTheWayThingsAre   but sometimes they make me feel more sad tho  idk why   I absolutely love music and art  i have complete discographies from a lot of artists  both digitally  illegal of course lol or free stuff  and physically on vinyl  cd  etc     Can't get into Suicideboys  Pouya or stuff like that tho  i've tried but i just can't  In fact right now im listening to WhenTheTreesMeetTheFreeway by Bones   On Prozac  and I think it's numbing me as well  not in a good way   It either could be my depression or Prozac that's causing this  Take small steps  There's a sub I think it's r bodyweightfitness which can get you started  I think doing exercise helps I see a few things to look forward to   Finishing school and graduating  Becoming fluent in English  Your written portion is okay but could be improved  Completing summer exams  Finding a girlfriend    Life can be pretty dull when you don't know what to do with your time  It sure is for me   I think we have all gone through this  it's best to leave it in the past as you cannot change it  If there are any people still in your life from that past and you know you hurt them  it is worth asking them to forgive you  but otherwise just do your best to move on  I hate sad dreams  Or those dreams where I'm late for work or school  They can ruin my day  Prozac  60 mg daily  I still have plenty of depressive episodes  The song is Fifty Grand  Scary all over   and that's a real rarity i dont really know of much similar but Fifty Grand is the artist so i'd recommend checking more of him out  it sounds like a girl because he was born a girl  but identifies as male now  P confusing stuff    m59 is the song by bones and drip 133    also a great song  cheers for checking it out  D i love sharing music especially when someone likes it   which is rare haha  Yeah bones is just a god  I couldn't really get into  B but they slowly grew on me   but still more a SESH fan  Will give Sadlythats   a listen    kind of slept on Rotten  Those are all fair things to want  Everyone is entitled to them  I'm in the same spot  I'm at a real low point  I know I have to go get whatever I want  It's a matter of drive  I can't motivate myself  I keep telling myself tomorrow is the day my life will change  Ugh idk    I'm just rambling  Good luck with everything man  Happy new year to you too  Yep and yep  I don't know if it's depression or the medication that's doing it    because i am a loser I don't know why  but I've been consistently feeling worse over the past few days  I've had a pretty bad first half of December  but right before christmas  I began feeling better  Then christmas came  basically my whole family collapsed into chaos and my mother threatened to kill herself   I got a mild flu  missed the only party I was ever personally invited to  had a fucking horrible new year's eve  still sick but tried to throw a small party  a girl I have a kinda complicated relationship with  she gives me the fault in her depression  and when I cut myself in December she just punched me and got mad at me  came by and got on my nerves  I was completely alone at midnight and realized the new year wasn't gonna be any better  On January 1st I woke up fine though  I felt really OK  But then it started  a gradual decrease  I don't know why  I don't know when it will stop  and most of all I don't even know why I'm posting this here  It just kinda feels like the thing to do now  Woops  screwed up the name  haha  I'm going to look up more things by him  Will it stick  Or do I have to keep this regimen up indefinitely   I was hoping for a fix  not relief Not too much out of your way  it seems     Yeah  I had a small class of  I don't remember  9  They all grouped together to smoke  buy lunches  and bitch about homework  It was awful  I don't smoke  can't afford take out food  and wanted to go to school and knew I would have homework  I just silently toiled away and kept to myself    It's okay to just want to be alone and chill  My family is inviting to all these events  they'll pay for me to go since I can't afford it  but I just don't want to go to a loud event with a bunch of people I don't know  They have a hard time accepting it but it's my life  It's your life  You can live it however you want as long as you're not hurting others    I think a lot of the 'happy people' don't have depression and just do what everybody else does because they're pressured to and it's easy for them to fake it   the problem is actually thinking I am worthy of success  Of thinking that i am actually good enough to succeed   Happy and healthy new year all      My EOOD journey starts today   I've been lurking for a few months  And because of this sub  a few weeks ago I decided that if I am going to lay down on the couch and sleep or lay the day away  I at least have to go out and walk a mile  Thus far that has worked   most days I walk 2 4 miles  and so now I'm stepping it up and getting back to the gym  I  need  accountability  and I had great success before at Kosama  a class based gym  so I enrolled there again  5 6 days a week the first thing I'll do in the morning will be kicking my own ass  It is a well deserved ass kicking  I have put on weight  failed at maintaining a relationship  and am struggling to finish grad school  Instead of spiraling out of control  I'm spiraling into a rug of bleakness  So I'm taking a left turn and taking my life back   My number one goal is to find an equilibrium  My life has always been filled with extremely high highs followed by extremely low lows  Last spring and summer was the high high and fall was yet another low low  I fear that this momentum will lead to that  That's why I chose an early morning class time  the decision to get up and go do will not be an all day process where I come up with a reason not to go  it will be a decision I make and  hopefully  a routine I can get into  I chose to start the x effect card today too  I figured that this could be a good way to see the new normal and mark down my progress    I do have one question that I feel ridiculous for asking  but whatever    if I like the Facebook page  will people be able to see that I did    I've always just slipped away during my episodes and I really don't want people I know to know about my struggles  I want to do this on my own  for me  and maintain that anonymity  This is probably not healthy    but for now  I think it is what I want    Anyways  that's me  I'm here  struggling with the rest of this sub  for a better and more confident me  Cheers  edit  jumbled words  This is so true Yeah  I'm gonna bring it up to my doctor for sure then  The thing is that I started taking Prozac as soon as my depression started  so I don't know if it's worse than before tell her it was the best day of your life  tell her you want to hang out more  dont be needy and annoying  constant unreplied messages ect  but just tell her how you feel   odds are she feels the same and maybe she thinks you don't like her because you didn't kiss her on that day or hug her or some shit   relationships are weird   you're very young don't stress lots of lessons to be learnt still    good luck buddy  you should report that person it's clearly not a job for them  and if she does say she doesn't feel the same way about you   don't let it hurt you   we have all been there   i had a girlfriend at your age who i absolutely loved to death but i was so shy and nervous around her even though she was my girlfriend that she dumped me  life goes on  P Happy New Years Internet stranger  Hope life is slowly getting better for you and know that people out there care about you  Yeah  and the legal culpability they'd face even would be horrendous    I thought of another good one you might like  Spooky Black   Without U   just don't let the video creep you out haha Huh  The years just aren't something I pay attention too  Pretty sure I just don't want to think about time progressing   thanks x2   from someone whos got a bad habit of just browsing "hot" good stuff  i'm sure your boss will understand  mental health should be treated like physical health  you wouldn't go to work with a snapped leg  so why go with a broken mind    best of luck mate  may i ask   are you a heavy weed smoker  no assumptions just wondering  paranoia sucks ass  i can't leave my house without thinking my roommate best mate is fucking my girlfriend the minute i leave   even though i know they both have more respect for me than that I agree  I've tried to die with carefully calculated doses  several times the lethal dose  of IV narcotics combined with hard alcohol and Benzos and I woke up both times in my own vomit  It's just so hard to shut the body down   Am in exact same situation  My exams start on thursday and I don't  know what to do   I'm not saying there's no such thing as talent  but even great guitarists admit that practice is the most important  Also  I know a guitar teacher who's been teaching for 20 years  and he said he never had anyone he couldn't teach  For some people it might take longer to get where they want but that doesn't mean they're gonna be worse musicians at the end  Also  maybe you need a different method  or a  new teacher    Don't give up on it  sertraline   i was on 50mg for 3 years and it seemed to help alot with anxiety  recently gone through some rough times and doctor upped my dose to 100mg  50mg is lowest possible dose   its been about 3 weeks and i still feel depressed  suicidal  but also numb   i can't cry anymore   crazy moodswings  lots of sitting in bed feeling sorry for myself  I didn't know what I was doing  Just being reckless really but I found out dying is a lot harder than in the movies  Your body just has a natural instinct to survive  How old are you  You can grow out of the self loathing   wow  thats so rude  if you ever need to talk to someone that isnt a bitch  you can always hit me up  hang in there  3 on new years day  what a cunt  excuse my language    it's very normal to be depressed after that   hope you're all good and can find something to keep you busy  i joined the gym recently and go at like 2am so noone else is there and just lift weights like a meathead xD it seems to help alot though  good luck from a fellow 23yo aussie  But they said it was my fault because I dressed slutty for so long i was happy just playing video games by myself   fuck going outside   but now i don't even have the motivation for those   switcheroo CALL POISON CONTROL  800  222 1222 OR 911 IMMEDIATELY  Keep us posted  Pm me if you'd like someone to talk to   Well  I've recently had some changes in my depression  and have a clearer view on how it cycles  so I might have some perspective    I used to always think  back when it was mostly depression  that the happiness would come again  About two weeks during the summer every second year  and it's three times I've had that cycle now  For the same amount of time that cycle last before that  I was slipping into depression  and didn't realize  After I realized that  I tried  I tried to get better  I got to the point where I can have happiness every so often  and even break out of my depression for said amount of time  Kind of like all those happy moments finally adding together to actual happiness   More recently  I've realized that I have kind of neglectful parents  and really need to get moved out to be happy  I'll be working towards that for a good while  I've started making friends  I hate that I thought that way about suffering to reach some happiness  Like I mean  I hate it with a physical revulsion  and anger laden on my tongue  This is because I've had happy moments and happiness actually occur together some recently  circa making friends  I've realized just how sad  how damn depressed  how much I've been missing out on  How much even that happiness that I fought so hard far was part of the 'shit show'  I hate that I'm not happy now  when I think about  How do I think this applies to your situation   I cross streets easier now  not waiting to the point of irritating drivers  because  well  because  Those shit shows don't seem worth it anymore  and I'm a bit lost  Happiness kind of makes other stuff taste like ash  hey  Here  though  is what I think  I think it may be temporary  That the more happiness we get  the more we'll be able to realize that wanting to kill ourselves or wanting to die really aren't too different  They're both the same sorry state  the same lack of care for life  And the more equipped we'll become to deal with these states  I mean  you need to be being more happy for a reason  right  Just keep doing that  Mostly try to enjoy it while ignoring the suicidal impulses  That's what works for me  it might work for you  I don't know  I'm just saying it's something to try  But sometimes  whatever it takes  get mad  get sorry for yourself  feel vindictive that you didn't get to be happy  before   Start looking at those shit shows and wanting to say 'cut'  Not because of what they're doing to you at the moment  worsening the depression  but because of what they've taken away  being happy   Eh  maybe not quiet some perspective as   a   perspective  Take with salt  Wait  wait  take with sugar  Easier to swallow bitter things that way  Dude  26F  Okanagan  Roman Catholic family of 6  depressed since 10  went to small town private school until 13  moved to city public school 9 12  always moving  not much friends  introvert  cannabis club since 16  Is your family from Eastern Europe too  lol  we are plenty  if you leave the house you may find some    Hope and worry never stopped an avalanche  You have to be more proactive and find a new steering pump   Reach out to your family  take your mom to Stanley Park and ride bikes or just walk around  Call up your nieces and nephews to vent a bit about your roommates and then ask them how they are and let them vent to you    It was really hard for me to find a relationship  My method was to work really hard on myself so that I was the perfect partner for someone  Then I went out with friends and got excited about being social because my goal was to find someone special  After pursuing a guy  who just wanted to be friends  he introduced me to my current bf  It can happen   Yesterday I woke up feeling OK  I thought  the new year might be good  But since then  I've fallen into the same pit I had just emerged from  maybe even deeper this time  I don't know what's going on  and how long it's gonna last  but I hate it  Now I'm still to much a coward to actually do anything to myself  but then again  that means I'll have to endure this for longer  Fuck  I truly believe everything will be fine  It used to sound like it was an automatic thing that everything will be fine but I have changed my perspective  I see everything will be fine as 'no matter what  you wake up and can make different choices today'   I think it's more about the present moment will be fine because the present moment is literally everything we have  We have no past  we have no future  we have the present  As long as you're not in clear and present danger then everything will be fine   It was absolutely not your fault  you can dress however you like  The problem lies with them  100   You didn't do anything wrong  remember that  Please  speak to someone you trust  get tested on drugs they might have given you  and never forget  IT IS NOT YOUR FAULT  Did you get that person's name  Call them when you have time and demand that you talk to someone higher up like a manager   They should be able to see who was talking to you at the time you were calling them if they have your number   That employee should not be allowed to do that to more than one person  We are atheist good choice    no deity cares enough to help us I disagree with this completely  As one of those "pretty ones" you mention who's also fighting depression I think it's pretty rude to generalize like that  No one falls over for me and I don't expect everyone to be enamored at my body  Being "pretty" does not force people like you  Being manipulative and controlling force's people to like you   Am i ugly and gross then  Is there contact information for admistration   Most have some way to provide feedback about your experience  I'm gonna think about how to approach it and come back to you if I think of anything  but I really think it's something important to do  Guilt is a shitty feeling  I just spend my time in the shower wishing I could be different thinking how fucked up my life is One thing  Fuck those guys  I'm honestly casting shame on them  You don't take a serious job like that and be an asshole  Like seriously how the fuck could they allow a person like that to work there   There is nothing wrong with you  Its with those people you talked to  Seriously I feel bad for them that they must be having a bad day or grew up to be like that  You on thw other hand  have depression  a painful illness  And you have better manners than them   Something is wrong with them here  not you  Not your fault  You're not a slut  They absolutely forced you and raped you  Holy hell  please go to the hospital  tell them you were raped  call your parents  call the police    You did nothing wrong  You were drunk and underage  They actually raped you  Please  I can't imagine how you're feeling right not but you have to tell your parents  you have to see a doctor    What they did was straight out of a true crimes show  You did nothing wrong  They are horrible people  never hang out with them again    OP  please  this is very common because rapist blame the victim  you  for what they did  They were in full control and probably planned it  You are at no fault  You are underage and could not have given consent and you were intoxicated     The US needs a much more effective mental health system   It shouldn't be a fight to access affordable services  This reminds me of the classic Jim Carrey stand up routine where he does a skit commenting on this    "How are you  man "  "I'm all dead inside "  Fucking hilarious  I'm too Depressed for exercise I can't go 1 minute doing it I have no one I want to confide in because most people in my life have not gone through as much shit as I have  How do I know this  I play the role of 'counselor' among my friends  Maybe they haven't told me everything they've gone through but it doesn't matter coz at least they have me to turn to  I have no one  I'm deep in debt and my situation is not getting better at all  FYI  skipping more than one dose of lamictal can be dangerous  If your blood levels drop significantly and then you go back to the dose you'd been taking before they dropped then you risk the SJS rash  But at least you started taking it  Why haven't you been good about taking your meds  Do you think you don't need them  Are you in denial about your diagnosis or do you think they'll hurt you somehow  I want you to feel well  If you called a national number  you could try looking for a different number on your county website  assuming you're in the US   Also  http   www nami org Find Support has the option of selecting where you live in the US and finding resources on their website  You're not alone  I've heard of the suicide hotline hanging up on people before  it has more to do with the receiver probably not having enough training and or not being very good at their job   Nice   I love this quote  "before I began running the idea I'd ever go a mile seemed impossible   And of course it was  until I ran a mile "  Keep on going   Small steps are huge steps      That's so sweet of you to care for your younger brother  If you can't be there physically you can be there electronically  Send emails  e cards  maybe start the same game app and play together  skype  send small packages  Try snail mail because it's fun to get things in the mail and the physical material is something he can have at home to look at  Im down Are you sure its not my fault  One of the boys keeps trying to contact me for sex but says he will never date me because I'm not attractive enough and a gross slut Don't let this one experience with them taint your whole outlook on the place  The one person I got back in 2010 cared a lot and stayed on the phone with me even though I wasn't all that kind and was frantic   Still  sorry you happened to get someone like that  All of my doctors  OB  MFM  pdoc  and a reproductive psychology specialist  warned me to have a plan  and that postpartum is hands down the most difficult and potentially dangerous time for a woman with bipolar disorder  They advised against breastfeeding both because of meds and because I need sleep to stay healthy  I had a LOT of help from family and my husband  6 months PP I have had only one moment that scared me  I was feeling like my husband wasn't pulling his weight  but he totally is  because I was so overwhelmed in that moment  I screamed at him with the baby right there  the baby wailed  and I instantly just crumbled into tears and sobbed for a couple hours  Other than feeling guilty and like a shit mom for bringing hostility around my little baby  I have been fine since  I am compliant with meds  I talk to my therapist regularly  and have immense family support  I think that "episode" would have happened bipolar or not  It's all about being proactive to stay healthy  being super aware of any slipping  and having people to help  My husband and I had an agreement that I had to be stable on meds for at least one year before trying to get pregnant  Being a new parent is tough  and tougher when you worry that you are a time bomb  but my child has completely changed my world and I will do whatever it takes to stay healthy and be the very best parent that I can  just like anyone else   Hi there and welcome to EOOD  glad you like it here   It sounds like you have a good plan for getting into exercise to me  I have always preferred working out first thing in the morning  I say to myself that if I can get up at 6am and go out in the cold  rain and dark to work out then the rest of the day is going to be ok   You dont have to like the facebook page or anything else if you don't want to  Personally I don't even have a facebook account  They said they couldn't of raped me because Im not attractive enough and fat and gross so true  everyone has their own chemistry and responds differently  it sucks that so much gets put on our shoulders when we are at our worst  Its like asking a prisoner to choose between isolation or suicide watch  Are you able to stay in contact with him via skype   facebook or anything  My little sister is in the UK but skype keeps us close  and i message her on facebook every now and then to make sure things are ok   you certainly should not feel guilty for pursuing your career  and don't be ashamed to admit he is your best friend   that's fucking awesome and heartwarming  This  Maybe a try lightening the load for this semester    Drop one class and pick up a hobby with friends   or volunteer at an animal shelter    Try switching to a fun class  like art  music  films  something low key that can help relieve stress and be something to look forward to   Maybe switch your schedule so that one day a week is u baratineur day  You get to sleep in  go out for brunch with a family member friend  go to a movie  window shop  walk in the park  whatever you feel like   I've had the suicidal depressions for the last 15 years  Here's my 'stack' that FINALLY got rid of it   Morning  sarcosine  l theanine   caffeine  Vit D and 'Mood plus' supplement by Thorne research Evening  melatonin supplement before bed as needed Daily  10 15 min mindfulness and breath work  20 30 min physical activity that makes you sweat  20 30 min stretching  with focus on breath   Eat a whole food  plant based diet  Weekly  microdosing lsd  10 mcg  every 4 days or on 'bad days' Monthly yearly  100 300 mcg lsd or psilocybin every 2 3 months  Taking the pills is the easiest way to start  The real results come from the mindset you develop through mindfulness and diaphragm breathing  It's like re learning how to human  sorry if i repeated the other reply i was writing it while there were no comments Well  that's not good  For your sake I hope it wasn't something like Tylenol because dying of liver failure is one of the most painful ways to die  In all honesty even swallowing a massive amount of pills is one of the least successful ways of taking ones life unless the person is knowledgeable about the cocktail they're taking   With that said  go puke and then contact poison control  Understanding that starting a business could be high risk and deciding not to do it seems like a reasonable decision  It'd probably be more manic if you realized it could be a bad decision and impulsively dumped your entire savings into it anyways   My friend   Please call 911   I know how hopeless life feels   I've been down the road of wanting to die   It can be so hard to hold on   But if we don't  all we will ever know is the crushing depression   We owe it to ourselves to keep trying   Please don't give up    I guess I am confused on why you think you are bipolar II  Is it because of the experience with the franchise  That doesn't really sound like "grandiose" behavior    Even hypomanic goal setting type behavior for me has been taking the LSAT and deciding to move 2000 miles away to a Law School in a town I had never really been to because I thought mountains were cool  That was a hypomanic "grandiose" goal setting thing   I ended up going fully manic in the almost three months I was there and spent  30k on my credit cards  Then I left Law School    I am also Bipolar I though   I agree with the other person that said Lithium is far less damaging than mania  Mania can destroy you physically  I spent three months doing cocaine and sleeping with some people you wouldn't want to take home to your mother   emotionally and financially  It can ruin your relationships and cause you to behave in ways that are completely unlike any way you would behave if you were not manic  You can lose your job  your home and your family while manic  Not a good time  Trust me when I say the lithium is a far less scary monster when you are facing all of that   That being said  there are multiple mood stabilizers  and a bunch more that are used as mood stabilizers that are not specifically rated as such    If you are true to life bipolar  most studies  and most but not all  doctors would suggest that an antidepressant alone is a bad idea  Citalopram  Celexa  is an antidepressant  The reason for the monotherapy being considered a bad idea for bipolar folks is that it has been noted that antidepressants seem to precipitate mania or hypomania in much of that population if some kind of mood stabilizer is not also on board  Some people with bipolar disorder cannot handle antidepressants at all  Everyone's makeup is different though so everyone's doctor has to treat them as an individual   I suggest you discuss your concerns with your doctor  That person is going to be the best person to answer the question for you  From the limited information you gave  I am suspicious that you are not in the right ballpark but I am not a professional and no one should make ANY kind of diagnosis after a paragraph of information   You also should not put a whole lot of stock into much of what I have said since it is based off of the very little you wrote and I am not a professional  I just felt compelled to give you SOME kind of answer since I didn't want you to think no one cared  It's scary to be confused about what is going on  I've been there  I really hope you and your doctor come to some good answers for you    Really proud of you man  I grew up in a similar situation  9 years apart here   My brother is too young to require much financial emotional assistance but I try my best to be as good of a brother as you are     like the other commenter has said I recommend keeping in touch as much as possible  Buy him a souvenir or something to mail over maybe  I know I would love to have an older sibling to keep in touch with even if only over the internet   Reach out to him and talk about how you've been feeling  I know I clam up and push my bf away when I feel low  I am learning that it's okay to tell him I've been having a bad day  It helps a bit for me   Fuck that  I'll take any saving or advice I can get  I am 100  sure  I am 90  sure they planned this   It's definitely more true in some situations than others  With the internet  it's easier to be able to talk to people  Also it depends on the environment you're in when you're trying to talk with someone  They raped you  It doesn't matter how attractive they think you are  or fat you are  or if you're gross  they drugged you  Alcohol is a drug  and forced you to perform sexual acts for them  then held you down   You are only 15  You are a child in the world  What they did was horrible and manipulative   Have you told your parents  Our collective understanding of these conditions is lacking  and misdiagnosis is a thing  At 18  I attempted suicide  I didn't have any of the other symptoms I've experienced in depressive phases  I just thoughtfully evaluated the challenges I was facing  concluded it wasn't worth it  and methodically planned and executed an attempt  There's a long tradition of people committing suicide to escape shame and dishonor  e g  when outed for scandal or crimes  It's a very recent modern take that suicide is a slam dunk indicator of Major Depression  Anyway  I was diagnosed with MD   At 20  I had a manic episode that resulted in total insomnia  I was again diagnosed with MD  because insomnia can be a symptom  At 27  another manic episode with insomnia  Again  MD diagnosis   At 35 I had a manic episode with psychosis  and was finally diagnosed with Bipolar I  which I believe to be the best available diagnosis for me  and which I believe came 15 years late  despite my being entangled with the MH system for much of that time   At 37  I had another manic episode with psychosis  This time I was misdiagnosed with schizophrenia and put on irrelevant meds  As a result  I stayed totally manic for 3 months  and my life was 90  destroyed  I'm told that's really bad for you  Finally  a different doctor intervened and put me back on Lithium  and the mania stopped in a few days   Lithium isn't necessarily terrible  I never had any noticeable side effects from it  As I understand it  it isn't without risks  though   Anyway  I don't really know how one goes about getting the best diagnosis in this kind of system  Unfortunately  "getting the help you need" does not necessarily get you the help you need  But it might be the best you can do  just the same  In my experience  the state didn't matter as long as I had a valid prescription and or refills owed to me   Your Michigan doctor might not be willing to keep prescribing for you without seeing you regularly though  so you might want to look into finding a new doctor in the location that you moved to     Look for a walk in psychiatric clinic near you if one is available and you need a new prescription on short notice   Wellbutrin isn't really considered a dangerous substance so they shouldn't give you much trouble on getting the same dosage  I use this subreddit as a support group  kinda like an AA AlAnon meeting  I do a similar thing on r anxiety   The ability to express my concerns  fears  and hopes to a group of people who understand has helped me so much  People saying 'wow  i know exactly what you're talking about' makes me feel less alone   Seeing people recover gives me hope  Just talking to people that have the ability to comprehend what I feel like is freeing    I agree that its really frustrating when people who have never experienced anything like a mental illness try and shove their two cents in  Not only do they not understand  they straight up can't understand    They say stupid shit like "Go for a walk  That will fix you right up " or "you just need to get out and enjoy the world " Kay   Nah  they just need to go outside  Fresh air is real antidepressant  First thing to do is pick someone in your life looks like a family member for you  and open up to him her  Explain how you're feeling  how you want to escape  Emphasize you dont expect that person to magically cure you and make everything seem like rainbows and unicorns  Trust me when I say it's always better to open up and speak to someone than try and fix something like depression by yourself    Also go out and exercise  It helps  Just the act of exercising releases dopamine  Hit the gym 4 5 times a week  Plug in to your music and just run  do free weights or whatever  That's your "me" time nobody's gonna distract you and it gives you time to process shit  For me  things that bugged me or depressed me throughout the day week seem trivial when i work out  Almost like "why the hell did that bother me so much  it was literally nothing to be upset about concerned about"  It's the new year  people are gonna flock to the gym so you may have to wait or something for the equipment but i'd recommend just planning out a time of your day to go to the gym consistently starting now   You got this  It's all about trying and not giving up   Tell him exactly what you said here  You're the patient  but you're the one who owns the treatment  and you pay him  He has an obligation to answer your questions  and address your concerns  It's best to be on the same page   If not  you've probably got a bad one and should change  Bones is one of my favorites  But there is one person that holds me together  and I can relate with almost all of his lyrics  That's Bladee  his album Eversince is the best of the kind  You should hear the songs  Rip  Romeo  Lovenote  So what  Winter   Awesome    Can I have the dosages you used as well   Also would you say that Mindfulness and Psilocybin are the two most powerful drivers of this stack  No Im ashamed That has happened to me before  I felt powerless to make any connection with them  or to survive the anxiety and awkwardness that would ensue if I told them they reminded me of when I was younger and I was in a very bad state emotionally and pretty much friendless  Okay  I understand  May I ask why  I went to the gym today  There's still something inspiring about the cheesiness of new year resolutions  Any recommendations on how to be disciplined about consistently going to the gym  My pops said I should get a workout partner  but I am not sure how to approach someone and ask   I do my best so everyone is happy my feelings or desires are irrelevant    That's very demotivating  It's no wonder you don't feel like doing the oral report    Is it our choice if we live and work to live   Yes  We make all the choices in our life  even the choice to give in to societal pressures    Your existential crisis is what everybody experiences  Life can be inherently meaningless    A thought   All the drink  eat  party  and play games are available to you because of literally millions of people working to live  You are actually relying on millions of people getting up and going to work so you have the chance to eat  drink  and be merry with friends  You have relied your entire life on your parents going to work to live so you could go to university    Even when you decide to drop the university course  which is up to you in the end  you are still going to rely on millions of people to do what people have done for thousands of years  work to live   If you want to break free I suggest the middle path  It's the Buddhist way of life  I've always wanted to become a nun but I choose to accept the secular life  I still read and follow the middle path the best I can    I recently heard a great talk by the Western Australian Buddhist Society  In it was a story about the way we are help down in life  We can walk the path in life and we carry things with us  the past  the future  worry  depression  obligations  If we just learn to put these things they won't weigh us down  Take for example the university course  pick up a textbook  is it heavy  Probably  Now put it down  It is heavy  Not anymore    I have felt trapped and shacked in my life by friends  family  work  obligations  I have found the key inside myself and I hope you can too  Always remember that we have choices     I've had extremely similar experiences  I have found that I can "egg it on" and reach higher states of mania by indulging the thoughts and playing into it  I can also dial it down by being disciplined about being skeptical  This isn't fool proof  obviously  One can be sucked into delusion unawares  I've spent everyday birthday either alone or working since I was 20 I'm 28 now  seen his name on a few yung lean tracks   will check him out cheers I'm with u unifutomaki  hugs Try to relax and think about this for a minute   You are not worthless     Your thoughts are controlling you   You are in control of your thoughts   Whatever you think about most you become   Research things like the power of positive thinking   You have proved to yourself that if you keep telling yourself that you are worthless you will continue to feel worse   Guess what     It works the same way  same amount of effort to convince yourself that you kick ass   Meaning with positive thoughts you can become unstoppable   Trust me I have my struggles  but you have to focus on your thinking   It's ultimately putting you in the place you are at  Im so sorry you feel this way  If you need someone to talk to feel free to pm me  I also have no friends  so I understand  Once I get into public housing Ill probably never see a human except when I go to the store and doctors visits    You say youre strapped on cash  Are you in income based housing  Do you get food stamps    Im sorry to hear you have a family that doesnt care  Do they visit you at all  Have you tried telling them how you feel   Ignoring emotions is a coping mechanism I use a lot  It's left me pretty dulled  It also left me unable to deal with emotions  But it is a good idea to not get close to anyone that fast  That's healthy   Why put more energy into something  hoping to have a different outcome  Hi   I'm so sorry that you're hurting   Depression is exhausting and lonely   and I know how hard it is to break free of it   If you want a new low effort friend to vent to   please feel free to message me   Sometimes it's nice to just have someone to talk to    Awesome  I'm feeling the worst I've felt in years  I can't think straight  Any info shared is very important to me  Thank you very much  Also find yourself a hobby you'd be amazed at the wonders it can do  Especially when you see the progress you've done   Whatever you have that is overdue can truly wait   Your health and wellbeing is the first and foremost that you should focus on and everything is secondary   If anyone says otherwise  they are selfish and do not genuinely care about your well being   Feel free to send me a pm if you ever need someone to talk to   I love you man  3 and hope 2017 is the start of something great for you  I understand  but what if the outcome is different  I know how shame feels  I have been ashamed of myself for a long time but I am learning to forgive myself    Please tell your parents  Write them out a note  You need their support right now    If it's too hard  go to a doctor first    Are there walk in clinic nearby    Do you have a family doctor    Is the hospital accessible    Do you feel comfortable just calling 911 and talking on the phone  I think you're making a good start posting stuff on here    It really sucks that your insurance can't help you more  It sounds like you've had a hard time for a long time  Maybe try and find a support group near you  and I would suggest talking to your general practitioner about getting on an antidepressant    The support group would give you people to vent to that aren't your fianc  As much as he loves you  he doesn't sound like he's very good at being a shoulder to lean on  Its a skill that takes a lot of time to learn  and some people just are too sensitive to do it  They make your pain their own  and it just doesn't work for either of you  Especially because you're so close    He wants you to be happy  and it sounds like hes doing his best but this isn't something that he can fix and I feel like hes struggling with that  If you can find other people to talk to  it wil help you both   That's a feature  not a bug  If you want help  that's what r gettingoverit is for  r depression is not meant to be a recovery centric sub   I've been on latuda for three months now   and it has changed my life   It's not a cure   but it evens me out and I feel like a normal human is supposed to   I think   No more intrusive suicidal thoughts   and normal  proportional emotional responses to everyday stuff    Oh yeah man I hear ya  I have no desire to talk to anyone anymore  The ones in which I do are friends I've had since high school amd before my depression  I'm lucky in that they're amazing people  but I do know that one day we may fade away  and if not I'm lucky   However  they say to be successful is more about networking than anything  Well I ain't doing that for shit and I definitely ain't finding romantic partners   So I only hope that despite how I do experience loneliness time to time  that I will get used to it or something  That or actually have a desire to meet people  I'm in similar shoes to you  Most of my friends always come to me for advice and it's been this way for a pretty long time  so I really have nobody I can openly speak to about all my problems comfortably  If you wanna talk  you're welcome to pm me Why would they do something so horrible For l theanine and sarcosine I follow the pack instructions and adjust for body weight  so usually a bit lower  the other stuff is pre dosed  Micro dosing lsd  mindfulness has given me the biggest benefit  It helps erase negative behavioural thinking patterns  while helping me train to be calm and develop 'grit'  The first 3 months are the hardest  after that your mind and body stop fighting you and fall into the new behaviour patterns you've set up  The microdosing makes it easier to set up those new behaviours  you feel child like joy and wonder at everything and life seems shinier and easier to deal with  Okay  I understand  Do you know the approximate time that you'll be able to afford help  And okay  I think that making the log will be a good idea  to determine when you feel the most down  I am actually wanting to do this  I didn't realize I wanted to do this  but now I want to do it  Esp  with the teeth  They need work  Great job man  I'm too lazy to exercise but working with my dad gets me doing it  You have my admiration for getting it done  Most people here only care about their own problems  Horrible thing happened to you but you did nothing wrong   Please  tell your parents   or if for some reasons you can't don't want to talk with your parents  talk to someone you trust   about what happened  You should also contact police and you absolutely have to see a doctor   Remember  it wasn't your fault   We all felt deeply concerned about the way the person hotline handled the situation  To the op  you are not worthless and will never be  Do not let the emotions control you  If ever you need someone to talk to  pm me  I'll be there  Thank you  It's getting a little easier  My mood has been improving and I have found that my "voice" is fading with it  Perhaps it's for the best     St  Valentine was a martyr  You were not alone in your suffering  His skull is displayed with a crown of roses in Rome  Beauty always adorns tragedy   You can forgive them  but still enforce the fact that you never want to see or interact with them again   Forgiveness can be for you and not them  Holding anger inside has never helped me  I've always found it easier to let things go  and stop letting it hurt me    If you don't want to forgive them  then don't  You have that right  And  you can let it go without saying you forgive them  You shouldn't hold a grudge or let that hurt tear you up inside  but that doesn't mean you need to say you wish them happiness and a good life   Thanks for sharing I guess if all the strangers you meet are mean   Yes I've had this before on Wellbutrin butttttt that was after taking 2 grams of it  Two things may need to happen  I need some energy to try again  I may need to let things deteriorate more so I feel like I'm making progress lmao i'm on 300mg  150mg twice a day  so like uh what does this mean for me Okay  I understand  How do you feel about retrying therapy  Okay  I understand  Do you foresee that happening  Could be sensitive to it  I do know the hallucinations you are talking about tho  so you aren't crazy They don't necessarily kick you out but a stigma is placed on you for the rest of your career  It's what I'm going through now  every three to four years I have to tell my "story" all over again and placed back into the "behavioral health" program    That alone deepens my depression   You realise they're just trying to help  they don't understand and that's correct  but they want to help anyway  You could always try to correct them on why you feel the way you do and help them understand or just complain that normal people don't "get" you  I have the Mirena  Like it much better than the non hormonal copper Paragard  I don't think my moods fluctuate with my periods  In general I have found hormonal birth control to make that better   but am not sure if that's usually associated with combination birth control   Okay  I understand  the same things have happened to me  How do you feel about them not believing you  Skip your next dose and call your doctor as soon as you're able What even is friendship  How do you do it  Where is the line between being friends with someone and just talking on a forum    Besides that  I just can't understand people and they can't understand me  I can be petty  so if I were you I would message them saying something like "jk fuck you" and then block them  I'm not saying that its a good idea though    You can also take it back  even if you never speak to them again  Forgiveness is a feeling  You can forgive someone without telling an soul  and you can take it back in the same way     est so everyone is happy my feelings or desires are irrelevant   Well if people cared about how i felt i would have a choice to die or work where i want   I want to break free but im happy to contribute but im sick of being treated like a cog Well there's only one thing for us to work on  get better at meeting with strangers  Tfw I'm one of those loners types but no one ever talks nicely to me Peer support groups  particularly DBSA  Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance   Also NAMI   Is there a sub for people who want to help people with depression  I've tried a lot to help some of the people who are here  even if it's just being there to listen  but I've only had one person really want to talk to me    Helping others makes my depression ease off a bit and I'm always open for making new friends  people with depression tend to be extremely kind as well  I have these thoughts as well  I am damaged and I was born bruised  I met some girl online too which I'm over but sometimes still think of her she was my first but I hope maybe 2017 changes my view of staying single to maybe putting myself out there just make things better letting my heart heal That's a very difficult question to answer  There can be many factors and it's complicated   The best I can come up with is that they're selfish  inconsiderate  have twisted views on women  are too immature to date women  and they saw someone weak and decided to have fun an exploit them    Sometimes men do horrible things just because they think they can get away with it   If you don't do anything they will do this again    You shouldn't feel ashamed  They are the ones who should be ashamed    I understand that you didn't make good choices but that doesn't mean you deserved what happened to you  They did this because they're immature and horny and couldn't get a women their age to have consensual sex with so they preyed on a girl who is just learning about sex and relationships     Please call 911 and tell them you were raped on  the day it happened  by  the mens' names  and you're ashamed and don't know that to do    You are innocent in this tragedy  You're 15 and were sexually assaulted by men while intoxicated  Once  I called a nurse at the mental health place because that's where they wanted me to call if I had an issue with meds  and she said she was busy and I said something like "well  then I guess you don't give a fuck  huh " and she CALLED THE COPS on me  and they took me to the hospital because the nurse said I was trying to kill myself   I just needed to figure out something about my medication and they blew me off or whatever and to avoid any problems they just made me out to be a crazy person or some shit  A lot of mental health people are dicks and they get away with it because people think we're just delusional or whatever   Anyways  just let it go and maybe try again later if you can or call another number since there are a lot out there  Or I'm sure you can chat with someone here if you have to but you don't have to put up with being treated like shit  Sure  Who knows  http   i imgur com hWxFzkO gif  Cheated on tests in 2016 which 2017 will not include because if I fail I fail my morality doesn't need to take so many blows as it has already Honestly  exercise makes me feel worse I want to try and get better at driving so someday I might drive for real I'll practice that on GTA  and someday get a good looking car I'll enjoy Okay  I understand  Is there anything else you'd like to talk about  What about Psilocybin  I thought that was the new miracle depression drug that they're hyping up nowadays And I tried to kill myself by stabbing myself but my friend stopped me and now I'll be getting therapy pills    I'm not here to explain my mental health to someone who is just 'trying to help'  I'm here to share my experiences with people who understand    People who have never had cancer  or even a close family member friend with it  shouldn't butt in at a cancer support group discussion   I don't think you're dead because not sure the dead could post something online   but I think writing out how you're feeling might help  like in a journal or possibly make it into a novel some day  Maybe see if there is a cheaper option of some form of different therapy  I'd also suggest picking up some form of exercise and push yourself a bit harder than you know you are capable and it will release serotonin  the happy hormone  Also orgasms can help release serotonin  Message me if you need to talk  I've dealt with depression for most of my life I shower everyday for a whole hour it's relaxing from my stress and anxiety lets me think and cry it's a safe place for me Yeah I tried once felt worse about myself What does being treated like a cog entail  Do you feel underappreciated  I'm here  if you need someone Welcome to the club  minus meds  therapy  and forgetfulness  What to do once you lose feeling  Try whatever it is you haven't yet  if you still care to  otherwise the only thing to do is just float and wait  I've only openly called myself depressed to my ex girlfriend  who I still have an intense amount of feelings for unfortunately  I tried telling one of my other friends but she didn't seem like she was really gonna be able to help  so I dropped the conversation   Do you have anyone to talk to at all  Therapist accusing me that I have too high expectations     For me friendship isn't a one way street  If I constantly have to bug someone and put effort into it or it would fall apart on the spot then it isn't a friendship   If I'd disappear now and no one would notice  for months  it isn't a friendship  If nothing ever comes back from the other side it isn't a friendship   I think finding friends online is possible  Yet it's difficult and both have to maintain it  I had discussions with people online that were more meaningful than anything I had irl in years  Talked to people I could relate more to than anyone I met face to face    Yet real life friendships of course have a large number of other advantages   I am glad you didn't go through with your plan  I undertsand that it may not seem like it now but life can be worth living if only for small moments and little things that we encounter randomly during the course of living    I don't know what your situations are or what you are going through but when I was at your place I would often feel frustrated and had internalised a lot of anger  guilt and fear    I remember waking and feeling a vast emptiness within me as if an endless pit has opened up and it would suck all my feelings away  I remember feeling like my head was being torn apart by various thoughts that went in every direction  I would often feel frustrated and make mistakes than blame myself for making those mistakes and the cycle would go on and every issue will weigh like a mountain upon me    Therefore may I ask you why were you planning to kill yourself  I may not be able to do much but i can listen to you  And expressing your anxiety helps  It is better for you to speak write them than act them out    I hope you find your way and have a happier year    Nice  I can only muster a few modified push ups  Good job  It's okay  i understand  take a deep breath  try to write what you going to say  you can do it  is hard  but i believe in you  Focus on the love passion art aspect of your artistic field  otherwise it really won't go anywhere if you're trying to approach it like a normal job with success in mind rather than artistic expression   To your edit   I always get energised when I write stuff down  It helps because it's no longer all in your head  There's also the quote  which I'll paraphrase for now "people say light is the fastest thing in the world  But wherever light travels  it finds the darkness was there first"  Just remember  even if the darkness comes first  there's always the chance the light will find its way what about memantine  Hello  I just read it and i would like to congratulate you sir ma'am for having balls to say stuff i and many others wouldn't dare to say even on internet  Myself i was thinking about starting blog to talk about and vent frustrations with video games  double standards and ect  Good start  keep going and best of luck to you  That person sounds like a douche  That's not your fault  We are fault seeking society   pretty much i feel like i'm used and overlooked most of the time  Not that great  That's why we rarely talk anymore  They think I'm a liar  So I don't really have anyone I can talk to about things  I have 1 friend but she stays busy so I try not to bug her with my problems  I can relate to this showers are the only moments whihc somehow feel my own  I don't  just a few months ago I noticed I was depressed  everything going wrong in my life  I don't know why I couldn't focus with class and why I lost the strive to do anything  I've only kept this to myself   r getting over it  or  r GetMotivated are great resources   I personally follow the Middle Path  A Buddhist way of life   there's an endless supply of other people     they're just not really interested in getting to know you Honestly I wish my friends and family would ask me this question more often because it shows interest in my wellbeing   I think if you tell them the truth each time they may actually stop asking  I get what you mean though  I was like that before but lying hurts me and I hate it  Thus  now I've decided to be honest to myself and others  and if they don't like me for who I am then they don't have to talk to me  Generally when I ask someone how they are i really mean it  I ask this because when I used to be extremely depressed I would wish that someone would ask this to me while expecting a genuine reply  So I figured I could do the same for some too  However I usually get responses like "I am fine" and "Nice"  I feel you on that 100   I want to have a girlfriend so badly  I think about it 90  of my day and then when the time comes  I shoot myself in the foot  It has to do with the way we define exercise  Exercise can be walking around your house for 5 minutes or doing some simple stretches  Have you tried that   Yeah exactly I'd say live it to the fullest as long as it can last  Maybe you'll stay in touch and love each other from far away  maybe you'll meet again  What is sure is that you'll have made the best out of it and not given up on something beautiful just because of some idea of getting hurt in a while  I know the feeling of being overlooked  I am the youngest of four and the third daughter  A life of hand me downs and last choice   setting realistic expectations and realistic goals can really help with that  It's worth just setting 5 10minute goals for walking outside weather permitting  or stretching on a yoga mat  Maybe another time  Thank you for helping me work through this  I woke in a better way this morning and went outside and walked for about 15 20 min  You should see someone  it's a win win  Either you get the help you need to you're proven to be fine and your parents no longer need to be worried I called a depression hotline recently  and I was on the phone sobbing  When the operator answered the phone  all she did was say "Hello " in a condescending voice  I was scared and horribly upset over some violence that happened  and I ended up hanging up the phone because she wasn't saying anything  I'm sad that they never called me back or notified authorities that I was in a dangerous situation  Pretty shitty experience  I opened up to my eldest sibling   sometimes I think she forgot   and my current best friend   they both and I guess they both try to help   some days they do a great job and other days I feel like they forget  I walk around sometimes but I just end up back in bed Good for you for setting realistic goals and looking to improve your activity levels   I was diagnosed at 11  now I'm 33   My mother has been there for me for most of that time  especially the last 3 years       I opened up with my D D group a few years back and every one of us had their own struggles   We grew closer when we learned that we can trust each other       I just told one of my bosses last week about how my depression led to addiction problems   He was shocked but supportive in my goal to quit smoking and stop drinking every day   I used diabetes as an analogy  my body does not produce and process chemicals correctly       I hope you find someone to listen IRL and that you can find the power to share       Don't stress about college   It can wait until you are ready   It took me 13 years to get my BA   those student loans though   they will fuck all of our futures  With machines replacing more and more work being social  outgoing and charismatic will be even more important if you are looking for work  Call me the devils advocate  but I say don't  I only say this as being someone who has had those same thoughts before  The man I hurt is probably still hurting  but I wouldn't know because we have not kept in touch  I felt like reaching out to apologise would only bring him more heartache and pain  It may also give them the impression that you want to start over again  If that is your intention  then I say apologising would be great  But if you are not looking to be in a relationship with them again  I say that sometimes it's easier for them to process us as being the crazy ones then knowing that we are on an even keel now and don't want to be with them   Can you elaborate please on your answer  That people tend to always find the bad things in you before good things  Bad idea  Let's talk instead Thanks  i did repost to your suggested group  Got some great information from members in this group  sometimes ideas from people who deal with this gives parents fresh perspective   Same here  Every relationship hasent been essy for me  Especially romantic  I'm hoping that this year is different for both of us   one day  one step at a time   Thanks   So glad you found it useful  Definitely dude  girl problems are the worst   You

risks and carve out your own path Can vouch for this  As a woman bald guys are fine  Height is not an issue  A sense of humor  kindness  consideration  those things matter   Quite often the problem with motivation is that you have no reason to be motivated because you haven't succeeded in the past   because you weren't motivated    It's a vicious circle   I really do think that you need to start simple  considering your exams are so close  As I said  focus on working in very small increments and you'll find that you'll be able to get through a fair amount of work without being too influenced by the way that you feel  I really know it's so easy for me to say this but I've been through the same thing and this technique helped me  Well  I can't get over a breakup from 1 5 months ago  and this makes me feel pretty worthless  Love is nice while it lasts but afterwards  damn  Can't help crying even though I'm pretty intoxicated  yay  Well    I don't think that a designated time or space is needed to "heal" the depressed  It takes a lot of time to come out of depression and start viewing life with a more positive outlook but the realization that will spark the beginning can happen anywhere  Even here     The problem is that sometimes people in this group get upset when they see posts that are essentially "look how hard it is to love someone with your diagnosis " And this needs to be a place where they feel safe and accepted  Probably doesn't wanna change it because the diagnosis fucks your life up  Makes it impossible to get life insurance  might make it impossible to get health insurance in the future since we don't know what's going on with preexisting conditions anymore  I wouldn't worry about the diagnosis  especially right now with health care changes   Hey  His mother sounds like a jerk  Do you talk with a therapist at all  What are you feeling  I think it sucks that you can't talk to your boyfriend about it  Why do you think he doesn't want to hear  A therapist or supportive friend or anyone like that are good to talk to since they will listen and you don't have to worry about what they'll do   In any case  hang in there  The stressful times will pass and stability in your life is coming  Don't worry about them OP  You did nothing wrong  Some people just don't like they're job and are just genuine douche canoes  If you wanna talk I'm here and so are so many other people how is that she thinks you're manic at points in a conversation  when I thought in bipolar mania depression cycle in a period of months or at least days  not in a matter of seconds minutes during a conversation  I love mirena b c it won't be affected by my meds  trileptal fucks with estrogen and makes the pill be ineffective  and it's very very good birth control  However  I did have some mood swings when I switched and I get weird moods the week before my period  I attribute this to adjusting to natural cycles though  not to the IUD itself  I use clue to track my periods and that helps me remember that everything is ok    I just have PMS  It's really hard to open up  a lot of people with mental health issues tend to hide it but finding someone you can talk to will really help  You don't need to be upfront with everyone  just find one person whether its a friend or a therapist  Here is a really great article on why it's important  http   blog tranqool com 2016 10 14 emotional vulnerability can be a good thing  utm medium Reddit utm campaign Reddit utm source depressionsr utm term emotional vulnerability I'm so sorry for your loss  and it's totally normal to have overwhelming feelings and to need a place to express them   r SuicideBereavement is a small but caring community you can visit  and there are also some bereavement resources linked in their sidebar   As devastating as losing someone to suicide can be  these kinds of "think of your loved ones" messages can actually backfire for people at risk  so I've had to take this post down   getting involved in suicide intervention can be meaningful after we've lost someone  but it's also common to need to take time to grieve and heal first before we can do that safely  I'm glad to hear you've been improving  that's awesome  I remember st  valentine  yeah  Reminds me of a bob dylan lyric  "behind every beautiful thing there's been some kind of pain " I always get confused when I see those posts complaining about how negative this sub is   We are literally in  r depression  What    what were you honestly expecting  And end up in debt  But yeah  you are right  I don't gain anything from slaving from day to day  Do you really     As for help   a year   Two years   Thanks to an injury I'm just getting over financial stability is shaky   I may be able to regain some   I don't even have a college degree   Lately the thing that gives me the most relief is imagining simply not existing   The thought that  "If it gets to much  I can always die " is rather relaxing   Maybe reincarnate in another life  though I'm not hopeful of that   maybe one with better circumstances   Simply floating in the void  oblivion feels like it would be peaceful   It won't be anything  I suspect   it just  will not be    deleted                     0 7842      What is this   https   pastebin com 64GuVi2F 25844  That's good to hear  Hi i just opened a post looking for the same thing  PM' me if you want  First person I was ever truly in love with   told her to get together with her old boyfriend because I was too much of a wreck  Person I was deeply in love with and could even consider marrying  I was against marriage until meeting her    relationship fell apart because I pushed her away because I thought I had feelings for someone else and that made me feel like an awful bag of shit  Someone who I love dearly  one of the only people who experiences the world in the  same way as I do   no longer talks to me   Aside from that  I'm pretty much a sociopath capable of moments of extreme empathy  leading to much pain and confusion  I can pretend to be social but those situations exhaust me and I have extremely few real friends  So  I get some of what you're saying     I hope things go your way It's the fact that it's in combination of being short and bald having one is bad enough but 2's the nail in the coffin  It's not like I have high standards but I wouldn't find an average looking girl before anyone says personality matters  there has to be attraction  Not sure if this is relevant  but a lot of times when I think about things it's not perfectly linear  and I can make points without explaining how I got there  so people will often be dismissive of everything I'm saying  I try to think about what I'm really trying to get across from the start  and how I can explain my thoughts in a normal  logical sequence  whether or not my thoughts actually came to me in that way    If people are calling you stupid  it doesn't mean you're stupid  If you're having trouble communicating  it sometimes helps just to take a few seconds to really process your jumbled thoughts and plan out what you're trying to say  Of course  people can still mistake this pause for stupidity  but fuck them Hey man  what kind of work do you do   I'm bad at making and keeping friends  It's come to the point where I don't trust every single person  I find that just doing mundane tasks keep depressive thoughts away  Exercise is a great way to just tune out the world for a while  Taking a walk around the neighborhood with music trying to hit the beat of the music with your steps is very effective way for me at least to just forget all stressful stuff in my life  It also kind of makes a good excuse why I sat and played video games for 8 hours afterwards  instead of hating myself for it      I totally agree  and it's something I say to my students when they're worried about their friends  They want to fix things and make it better but its just not possible  Often a simple  'I don't know what's going on with you right now but I want you to know I'm here for you' is a really nice start  That was they know they're not alone  This is exactly how it started with me too  If you can push yourself to  you should really try seeing a therapist or social worker  If you're in college  they may offer those services for free   Or if you feel comfortable enough with someone  try explaining everything to them  If you have someone who can just be there to talk to  maybe hang out with even if you don't really do anything together  it can make the days seem a lot less bleak  People tend to focus on the bad stuff  the stuff that went wrong    We gloss over good things  like when you ask someone how their day was  They're respond "It was good" and then vent about something that went wrong    Rarely do people go on and on about how good their cup of coffee was this morning  They don't talk about the aroma or how it made them feel  More than likely they'll talk about how they can't get through the day without it  how they NEED it    People complain about flying  The wait  the baggage check  the rude flight attendant  'I had to pay for my food'  going through customs  No one has ever expressed cheer wonder and amazement at flying 30 000 feet in the air while sitting on cushioned seat in a steel tube with 100 other people   A lot of people at work think how they like to do things is the right way to do things  They think they are the best at their job  They become managers and get to flex their dominance over others  Do they praise and encourage new ideas  Rarely  They most often start 'shaping things up'  'cleaning up the clutter'  or 'tightening the purse strings'    We are a society of nit pickers and complainers  We even complain about Christmas and having to buy gifts  Like  woe is me  I have all this money  and friends  and family  and I have to show them love and appreciation for one day  Some people hate the holidays  They complain about Christmas music  I understand repetition can become annoying but you're listening to music about good cheer towards others  love  spending time with family    Think about the last conversation you had  Did the other person complain about things  Or did they gush and guffaw about how wonderful life is   Forget what's overdue  Congrats  You chose life       I never really got the "competition" feeling you desrcibed on here  When things were at their worst for me coming here was a way to feel less alone and to better understand what I was feeling  Sometimes I felt numb and couldn't even describe what was going on inside but then I would read someone elses post and they would be describing what I couldn't  It helped me and still does sometime  Now that things are somewhat better  reading here also reminds me of what I felt like before  It reminds me of how real those feelins were  It helps put things into perspective sometimes  Apparently people's first impression of me "this is the most awkward guy I've ever met"  I've asked multiple people and that's what they all said  And no one wants to be friends with an awkward person  The only people who I talk to are my roommates or people in classes who were forced to stay around me  r MaladaptiveDreaming  I have the same disorder  you are not alone  It is hard to live with but helps with pain or depression  Had it all my life   Usually has a trigger  mine is music  and can include repetitive movement  Do me a favour and try and answer me a simple question    It's going to seem condescending  but it really isn't  Are you in pain  Yes I thought the same thing lately  When I'm depressed I am really clumsy  while the rest of the time I don't break anything or do anything clumsy  Keep going  Could barely do a couple some months ago  now I'm doing 30  It makes you feel ten feet tall  Your post made me think of Notes from Underground by Dostoevsky  The main character was a dreamer  who would get mad at the inactivity his dreaming would result in  I recommend this little book to everyone  even those who don't enjoy literature  Same thing happened to me   'Duty of care' can be an awful thing  Basically they don't give a fuck about you or your needs or feelings but because the government forces them to have a 'duty of care' they over react like this so they don't get sued   It's a poor solution to a very complex and great problem and the treatment of those diagnosed with mental health issues is appalling   For what other illness would someone send a cop car instead of an ambulance  I am proud of you  In the future I can see myself spending the holidays away from my family  and that is fine  That is what I look forward too also  no matter how bad families are  you can learn from their mistakes and raise your own beautiful family the way you wish yours was  Just my opinion  both as a cutter but also from your message  but I don't think you're in denial  Cutting is seldom about suicide  regardless of the level of depression  But I agree with  u firefades  go see someone  I think it can only help  Hi  I mainly do web design and webdev work  I also worked in 2 mobile games with Unity3D  but they are not very great as we were a 2 men team and with less than 100 bucks    This year i really would like to publish something more  but i am not sure if i will be capable  That's a nice way to look at it  thank you    No  I've never mentioned it to my parents  I want them to be happy and not worrying about me  Should I tell them and get meds      I don't think talking to someone will help  Most of my depression is due to me thinking about my student loan debt everyday and still failing classes and further making it harder to graduate   I honestly don't know  Physical pain  No I don't really feel that anymore  as in paper cuts were the worst pain but now running a blade down anywhere doesn't hurt  But  maybe that's one of those 'I hate spinach to death' and then the next day you dont mind it anymore  Emotional pain  I don't think so  ive kinda had an apathetic approach to things  I don't know   Personality is everything  As long as your happy and confident  you are attractive  Wear nice clothes and wash that head and smile   D I though the same thing for a while  but after my condition improved i looked back on my 'inspired by depression' work and it was mostly crap  I think with more intense feelings we have a more intense connection to our work  and therefore more reverence for it  even when that work is comparatively sub par  People on reddit who wanted to talk to me have ghosted me    Isn't it fun to write to two different people offering help on r kindvoice and neither of them ever replies  And one of them even deletes both the thread and her account   Thanks  I guess  The reason I ask is that a lot of my depression is connected to huge amounts of pain  So what do you think it is that your depression makes you feel  Not the root of it  not why you feel that way  just what you are thinking or feeling at the time  I agree    I also want to work out and eat better  but it's really hard when i've got a family who litterally eats chips and drinks soda every  single  day  Good luck with your plan    Yeah you are right  spot on with the last sentence  Usually people don't tend to talk about the positive things in life   I think that is my problem  i have read around the reddit and it seems that people who want to help others usually are being used and in so you just have to take a "Chill pill" and stop caring so much about others   I actually have got some clarification right now  I like things to be perfect and thats why i think i am failing myself  For an example  someone needs help i have the urgent need to help ASAP  but actually do i need to do it  Has someone helped me ASAP like that person has  Maybe i just need to take things a little bit slower and a little bit chiller and not CARE so much about random people requesting favors   Yes for friends and family you should always help ASAP  But thank you for discussing and finding inner peace  Okay  I understand  Are you feeling concretely suicidal currently  That genuinely really helps  Thank you  Just keep trying     Most of my best and oldest friends were super awkward and that's what made me like them     Edit  I'm the opposite of you and I'm telling you it's not any better  I've always been able to pass easily through social situations but I've never been more than a week away from killing myself because I still think other people's opinions of me are much more important than my own  It's the attitude we need to change and accept that we should say fuck the rest of them  I'm not there yet but it's true  You're just as important as everyone that makes you feel bad  We're possibly the only intelligent life in the universe and we're only here for an insanely insignificant amount of time  I just wish some of us weren't cursed with stupid brains that make everything seem impossible  The identified patient   Same here  It spoke to me on a level no one had ever reached with me  Music is amazing that way   Okay  I understand  Have they said why they think that you're lying  I've been on it for three years  I originally went on it for sleep  It does the trick  I don't have severe insomnia anymore  As for depression anxiety  it numbs the pain for me  but there are probably better things you could take  You could always try it and quit  if you don't like it   You're welcome I often like to think about things in the big picture  kind of on the lines of this which is really well put  I think we boil our feelings down too much  Our emotions are so much more complex and beautiful than just "happy" and "sad"  There are some feelings and thoughts that we can barely even describe  I  personally  want to experience all of them  I know it makes me who I am   There is no such thing as normal  There's just you  That's awesome dude  I learned to programme in Delphi  a long time ago now  working in Unity would freak me out  Never did any webdev stuff  But I can probably take my gaming rig apart with my eyes closed  Dude  you have the perfect vehicle to help you socially and professionally  If you want to publish more stuff then find like minded people  The forums and areas for such a thing are endless  You're guaranteed to find someone that you click with and you'll be pursuing your professional aspirations too  If you ever need a writer or voice actor then consider my services at your disposal   As for the more emotional stuff  you're not alone my friend  I spent half an hour staring at a picture of someone I care about as I cried and listened to The Smiths  So I empathise   It's really just a matter of getting it all out  Same reason we're all on this sub isn't it  I'm just so tired all the time from depression  It really affects my life  I can't work as well or follow conversation or retain much in memory  This in turn makes me more depressed   This is all mental tiredness  Of course I've been to the doctor a  who have cleared me of any detectable Illness that could be causing it  Physically I am fine   I can run or cycle or do labourous tasks  like landscaping  for hours on end  It's just this mental slowness   Ugh  Don't know what to do  I feel like I want relief   Lately  I think about it constantly   Sometimes I'll be standing at my job at almost cry at the register in front of customers for no apparent reason   I pull it back together in time  though   I might come out of this and be okay for another two months   During those times it feels weird that I even wrote things like this   But I am becoming increasingly aware that it's coming back like a revolving door   Last episode lasted a month  with about two or three in between   Good news  though   It appears my state will cover suicide if it's after a certain amount of time   I can wait that long   If I'm going out  I'm going out on my terms  Puerile  I know  but at least I'll have accomplished something in my death   It would take me at least a day ish  probably  to get the materials I need to do it   I haven't looked up the specific methods so as not to make an impulsive go of it  I know right   Like I don't get it   I feel better today about it  It's as if a burden has been lifted off my chest   Memantine doesn't have demonstrated antidepressant effects in humans afaik  It would likely be synergistic for other uses of memantine   Alzheimer's  Parkinson's  drug use  neuroprotection     and help reduce side effects  though  I like the idea of pretending I'm in a movie  Despite my positive experiences  I hear this all too common  Someone I know said only a few days ago she had a similar experience   The people behind the Suicide Hotline ought to be told that their workers aren't doing what they're there to do  and are risking lives as a result  That fucking sucks You are not the least bit broken  A little cracked  maybe    But  as Leonard Cohen said  'Thats' how the light gets in ' It seems like you're getting yourself stuck in a self perpetuating cycle  You believe you're not good enough  so your mood drops  Those mood drops change his behaviour  you doubt yourself and your mood drops  He responds    As hard as it may be  sometimes you need to trust that you partner has good reasons for wanting to be with you and that your insecurities are your own  The misconception is that we are meant to exist with insecurities  but that's just absurd  And just remember that you don't get to dictate his feelings  You say you are unlovable even though he love you   that's not your decision to make and you need to accept that  You're clearly very smart and articulate  and I think you're probably quite perceptive  but you can't turn that perceptive eye on yourself   I've made this suggestion before and it has helped  Have a conversation  it can either be to yourself or with your boyfriend  Admit that you feel a certain way about yourself but you know that you can't change his feelings  Make a promise to try and reconcile those feelings between the two of you  It's not easy  it's long  but it could help  I'm the same way man  Definitely make sure it's not your sleep though  Make sure you are getting enough sleep and that your quality of sleep is good  Even get a sleep study done if necessary  Apathetic or extreme frustration  I just switch between the two  I don't feel pain  I am the exact same way  It's so hard to explain  Each day I live in the fantasy world of characters from my favorite shows and games  or  like you said  make my own  I'm always daydreaming  I wish I was in those worlds and not here  I'm in fantasy everyday  always tuning out real life  I'm glad I'm not the only one  I don't know if there is a name for this  but that's how it is for me too  It's still hard to explain to people  Basically  my mind is rarely here  it is always connecting things to the fantasy places I know of  What is the disorder called  Is there actually a name for this   I'm in a similar position as you  Also young and out of school  but completely without motivation for ANYTHING   They didn't say the exact words that I was lying  they said he wouldn't do that Good to hear and good luck   Note  some psychiatrists focus nearly exclusively on medications and you might also benefit from a psychotherapist or similar who you can talk with I prefer being alone  I'm socially awkward to the maximum too   can say this out of the blue  She doesn't know that I know her diagnosis  I don't want her to think I'm being artificial   You experience these things to such a degree that they make you suffer  Dude  what has someone else's suffering got to do with that  I know you voiced a lot of issues but I'm focusing on the one that's closest to me  You shouldn't feel like your struggles mean anything less than someone else's  they are just as valid  Once you're able to accept that you'll be able to start focusing on some of the root causes of your issues  yes it has  thank you I just want to travel the world  eat good food  sleep well  I don't even really know to be honest  All I know is working makes me want to kill myself  I thought it was because it wasn't the work for me but now that I've tried quite a variety of different jobs I'm starting to think it's always going to be the same  and I just can't imagine myself continuing to live my life like this   wanting to kill myself every day I'm going to work Ok  It matters zero how you did dress  If someone is naked it's still not okay to rape that person    They are trying to shift the blame on you  They are trying turn around the positions of "culprit" and "victim"  It was  their  responsibility to do these things  it was  their  acts    You are going through a very difficult time  Please try to find support about this  Talk to people you can trust  Try to protect yourself from any harmful feelings of others  Don't take any guilt or blame on you     Increase the amount of AMPAR receptors   Yes  sarcosine and lamotrigine both increase AMPAR expression  Sarcosine also potentiates AMPAR function by both raising glycine levels and co agonizing glutamate receptors   https   www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles PMC5069295   https   www

currents by sarcosine is explained in the above papers  Thank you for your wishes  I feel like I could do many things  but there's literally nothing I want to do that I could make a living out of  I feel so lost and frustrated  what even is the point of being healthy  having a family  living in a nice country and all that if I just want to kill myself 5 days a week  Maybe I'm just a lazy guy  I don't know  It's not like I don't want to do anything  I do want to learn languages for example but that won't make me money to feed myself and have a place to sleep You'll know her best so you will be better able to answer your question  but you can go about a few ways  Just be direct  'I know you're suffering etc ' Or be more cagey about it  'You've seemed  emotion  lately  you sure it's going ok ' Even if you get told it's all okay still make sure they know you're there to listen  that's always the best start and often enough Yeah well I'm going to graduate with over 150k in debt with a starting salary about maybe 50k  I hate everything There is no difference between real life and imagination  they're both abstractions  This is exactly why people can get addicted to video games  In theory  this shouldn't even be possible because video games aren't real  In actuality  both life and games are the same thing   abstractions   So don't feel too bad  Some of my most positive experiences in life have been in dreams  move to LA I don't have kik but we can talk here if you like Thanks for the reply     I agree that it's come pretty close to full mania  something my psych and I need to keep an eye on   There isn't really an advice for this  i'm a nice guy and i've been fucked over every damn time  I can't tell you "just stop being nice" but that's the only thing you can do if you want no more of this  The thing is  this world isn't really a place for nice people  everybody is just so self loving  selfish and stupid these days  fuck society   Best thing you can do is to expect absolutely nothing from people  because as soon you think you can count on em  they fuckin leave you   Seems sort of random  care to explain  I'm not american by the way so I can't just move to LA easily even if I wanted to https   www smd mb ca smd contact us  That is a disability services group for people living in Manitoba  Perhaps giving them a call while calling the mood disorders group again would be worth a try    Good luck  And I hope you guys are able to get all this sorted out successfully  You have done absolutely nothing wrong  The person you were talking to is the one with the problem and should not be working with people let alone people who are suffering  Everything you feel  no matter what size is valid  You matter  NEVER let anyone make you feel like you don't  I have no doubt you'll come through this a stronger person   thank you for your input  I sent you a pm  Wish you a happy year  too  Thanks for the reply   I'm glad I'm not alone  I agree  it's so easy to get sucked in   You were raped  You are not a slut  and you did nothing wrong  Please consider going to your parents  and to the police   Hey okay I sent you a pm  thanks If you don't mind my asking  what meds are you on  Message me if you'd rather not make it public  This was me last year  I just kept waiting for an "a ha" moment that would snap me out of my funk  but it never came and I failed all of my courses  It took weeks of spending some time outside in the sunlight to start gaining my energy back  Any little change that you can manage that will break your cycle will help  Keep on pushing through  Cudi's new album has been helping me Well done  that's a really big step  It took me my entire adult life before I went for help  I have never smoked weed  Thanks for the well wishes  I don't know why mental health is so stigmatized   This is true  I'll talk with my doctor and see what will be the best course  of action  Thank you    I hope I can one day  Idk though  I fear I may push my bullshit on others  Got a lot of therapy before I think I'll be ready for that   Sex drive  Appetite   o I had the arm implant I removed it almost 2 weeks ago after a year it made me crazy and gain a lot of weight  And trying to cheerlead yourself into not believing those dark thoughts once they do start seeping into your consciousness  People always say why can't there be more kindness in the world and when it staring them in the face they abuse it and knock it down  So be who you are still be nice and kind  If they fucked you over and disrespect you cut them out if you let them treat you badly they will carry on   I don't even need to know you to know you are not a slut and that you are an amazing person  Please don't be ashamed  you survived an attack  that already shows infinitely more courage than these disgusting excuses for boys will ever have  Thank you  I owe it to my friend who helped me find the courage to actually realize that I need help and that its not something to be ashamed of  And then when you do finally find a piece of reality to grasp onto  you beat yourself up  and feel like an empty void for feeling like this in the first place and it's the never ending cycle   I never though I was lovable myself  but because you have a boyfriend who loves you  in my opinion  I believe you are capable of being loved  As for your depression  I've been going through this a lot myself lately  I'm afraid  I haven't had a girlfriend in three years  and it'll be four on the 13th of January  my last breakup    As for whether or not this gets better  all I gotta say is  for me  it ocassionally gets better  but without a girlfriend  I recede right back into the darkness  You've phrased it nicely  in a way that is somewhat consoling  for people like me who are always in some kind of negative mood and barely function   The problem is that our failure to meet societal standards isn't the source of our suffering  It's just an added burden  The problem with my existence isn't social shame  it's the fact that the experience of being me is viscerally painful day to day  Ridding myself of any and all pressure to be "normal" wouldn't change this fact    As it happens I do see it from an evolutionary perspective  and I notice that the puzzle pieces tend to fit together from this view whereas the religious view is a mess   For instance  why are so many people so unhappy  Because survival and reproduction are all that natural selection cares about  and both can be achieved by beings that suffer immensely  There are evolutionary advantages in traits that make you miserable as a byproduct   If you are afraid most of the time  you will avoid many dangers because you are always in a state of anxious defensiveness  If you are sad most of the time  you will be engaged in a desperate search for happiness   you will try novel things  be more creative  mate with more members of the opposite sex because nothing will ever satisfy you   Of course  there are random mutations and other factors and some of us will get an overdose of sadness anxiety traits   to the point that chances for survival and reproduction are drastically reduced   That explains me  Needless to say  I will not be selected  It's perfectly clear  and it's no consolation at all because I will have to endure myself until the end    Yeah  that's the Risperidone  I think a lot of those meds are cumulative  so they build up in your system  but you should be able to wean yourself off them  Are you actually schizophrenic or are you using them for the other side effects  I'm not doctor  I've just been through a lot of this shit myself   I don't think you'd be going behind your doctors back to get a second opinion about the meds  especially if they are causing side effects   My meds make my hands shake sometimes  and this is such a lame complaint  but it means I can't gently push the thumbstick on my ps4 controller  so sometimes I'll run instead of creep  And run to my death    No  I know I need them  Sometimes I just want to let everything go  though  I have bipolar 1 with mixed episodes and psychosis  so it gets pretty serious pretty fast  There's a part of me that just wants to let it   I used to skip days at a time before I stopped all together  and I know it messed with me  But I also know it works   go help at a soup kitchen or go buy groceries for some homeless people  anything that involves helping others  it'll jump start things That's a shame  How good is your insurance  Yer I think that's the anxiety  When I'm bad I can't even talk properly and become stupid and clumsy   Permanent solution to a temporary problem  I was line you 3 4 years ago  I had a few tough years nothing was changing and I just wanted to go away forever   I was eventually talked out of it and I'm glad that I was    It's one day at a time that's all you can do 100  feel you on the texting thing  It's like the rational part of your brain knows that there is most likely a perfectly good excuse as to why they haven't responded but your imagination can't help but create negative scenarios where she is doing it on purpose  I've ruined at least 2 possible relationships by letting my imagination get the best of me in these situations man    best advice I can give is use patience  Shit  I come from a very broke household so liability  The bare miminum to not have no insurance  I've cut my ties with them long ago  But still  Im miserable and sad probably because of my loneliness   Does therapy really work  Maybe I should go to one  Internet is a far different beast than meeting people in person though  Also internet friends are nice and all  but it doesn't fill the void for real life interactions  Because I always end up thinking "I wish I could meet you in person but you live 3 time zones away " It's exactly that  And I actually do believe in God  I believe he is the only one who can help me at this point  I just hope it won't take too long before I get help I made this mistake of trying to help everyone and asking moderators to make a stickied post about why people shouldn't hate themselves   However  after reading the rules and the moderators reply I realized this is the wrong sub for that  This sub is just to vent  relate  and express concerns  Its a great sub too  first of all i am sorry this happened to you  You should report this to the police and tell your parents  I know it might be hard to talk to the police but those guys might try to hurt other people and that would be awful  A lot of times ppl do things like that because they think they can get away with it  dont let them ok  Thanks a lot  We'll give them a shout   I'm still trying to figure out what I would prefer the outcome to be   I'm a little concerned that being on disability could affect her motivation to try to do things  Not sure how to respond friendo  I'm in same boat I've cut people out too for same reason and pretty much friendless now  I just couldn't let them drag me down anymore  If you think therapy may help do it definitely an option  I haven't seeked help about anything yet so can't advise what's good to do   I was super depressed last month and I came across the song called "Ok" by I C P off their most recent album The Marvelous Missing Link  Found  I love that whole album  I listened to it for a month straight  but back to my point  that sad actually made me feel so much better  I have Mirena and I love it  I now get normal PMS instead of outrageous suicidal mood swings and not having to worry about my birth control is a huge plus  One less pill to take every day was a big pro for me  too  The initial bleeding sucked and lasted like a month after I had it put in  but everything else has been a breeze  8 5 10 would recommend   I love it when I write something like "not so great  you " and they just write something like "good  good   "  You don't have to ask me why I'm not feeling good but don't rub your happiness in my face    i love  this  https   open spotify com user tamilicon playlist 0HI61t5j8CqNNHPRDJIgob  playlist Good  that's a great song  positive  and I hope you feel better tonight  As someone who has known more or less the same situation  I get you and if you need a random talk with a random stranger anytime   Maybe she didn't know what she wanted  and I'm not going to lie if you really like her it will take a while  But no matter the cause  you're better by yourself than being with someone not fair to you  You should talk to your friends  you might think you will bother them but don't worry they will understand how hard a break up can be  and going out with them should make you feel better  Do stuff you like to do with them  and eventually you'll get through it  Good luck bro Thank you for your post  I thought I was alone in feeling like this    I feel like there's nobody to talk to because it seems like they just want to "fix" me  My husband gets mad and asks what I have to be sad about   I would talk to my mom but she has enough to worry about   she's listened for years and I don't want to burden her with this anymore   I try to hide it from my 14 yr old son but he knows   I worry that he suffers a bit too because he asked one time why he was sad all the time  I don't want him to feel like that  I know how hard it is    My son and my mom are the main reason I'm still here  some days it's just too hard  But I can't leave either one of them  my mom has me and my brothers but she and I are definitely the closest  I couldn't bear to leave my son alone with my husband  he's a good man but he just doesn't understand a lot  he's in his own world that centers on his mom    Whether anyone reads this or not isn't the main focus  I just needed to get the feelings out    nice dude  pythong is a great place to start and c  is just good all round  Well  yeah  It is extremely unlikely I would be manic hypomanic every time I saw her   my  non genetic  adoptive family has not one but two BiPolar I sufferers  and well  I have the internet  Every single source I've combed from MayoClinic to Wikipedia to  gov pages describe hypomania and mania in a way that is inconsistent with my behavior  I wouldn't even mind if I was being manic  to be honest  but being autistic really muddies the waters for interpretation and it's terrifyingly common to be misinterpreted in my day to day life  especially by the    for the lack of a better word    provincial    and she's been enough of an asshole about it that I really have no qualms saying she's full of shit    Really  I have a huge tolerance for shoddy practitioners due to my condition  I've stayed with toxic psychiatrists and therapists for literally years longer than I should have in hindsight  and this woman is by a wide margin is the worst I've seen  It bothers me to sound haughty given my life and my real respect for all levels of medicine  but she's a nurse practitioner and she has all the earmarks of someone overstating her expertise  The only reason I'm still there is that I haven't gotten off the waiting list for a psychiatrist well covered by my insurance and I need medication in the mean time    If I called you a table  would you believe me  Of course not    Hard though it may seem  try applying that same concept to being called a slut    Based on what you said in your post  you were raped  plain and simple  And it sounds like it was planned on their part  If your relationship with your parents is a good one  tell them about this  And as others have said  consider going to the police   I live in Canada  Im just curious of options out there  I had the Mirena for many years and am getting the Skyla soon  hopefully  the pharmacy is being super slow    I love IUDs so much   It doesn't mess with my mood  but you may find your period naturally upsets your mood  I know what you mean   I have to say I notice a big difference when Im not constantly smoking weed   I guess it could be any drug really  but it changes my brain chemistry to the point to where if I smoke everyday I have to have it to feel normal   Now that its been a couple days I feel like Im leveling out and much more 'myself'   As far as feeling like there is no future to hope for  I know how overwhelming that can be   But even though I have those times   hopefully less as time goes on and I continue to work on myself   its good to remember that we dont know everything  we dont know what the future holds   Because of that fact there is always the potential for better things  and thus hope   Thank you for your reply   Heres hoping you feel better and we both just get wiser and happier    I have a copper IUD and would recommend it for everyone  It's non hormonal which is better for you  in my opinion   plus it's good for 10 years   It was the best day of my life  and I did say that  Thanks for the advice    CBT is cognitive behavioral therapy  where you see a therapist and help rework some bad habits or bad emotional coping skills  CBT for me is seeing a therapist once a week or so and we go over what I did and what I could have done differently  My therapist teaches me to be a better wife through skills and homework  like reading books or doing activities    DBT is dialectical behavior therapy and is more regulated  I went in a group setting  not sure if you can go individually  I did it in conjunction with my usual therapist but he doesn't do DBT  I loved it  it lasted one semester of school  I went at my university  We learned how to cope with emotional needs  and how to meditate  DBT is helpful if you have problems regulating every day emotions  like anger or fear  I still use many of the skills I learned in DBT today    I suggest finding a good therapist first and getting settled and then finding a group DBT group to see to supplement that    Keep in mind I did these things before my first manic break and did it just to cope with depression and feelings  I'm not sure how it would work on mania  but DBT gave me the ability to properly analyze how I was feeling when I went manic so I knew within two days something was wrong and within a week I was on an antipsychotic and diagnosed bipolar type one  I contribute both my years of therapy and DBT to keep me out of real trouble when I went manic    So  tl dr do both  but find a good therapist first because good things happen when you have a good therapist   Whatever you're going through right now  it will get better in time  Trust me  I've been there  And if you feel like talking  just post it here  We can all help you     lol sorry    its nothing special  im living in the same shoes as you  just over in the us  the music scene in LA is pretty awesome  my friends are over there making a "living" just performing for peers  they aren't rich or anything  but are happy that music makes them the money to survive  Remember "A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step"  Just don't give up  Wellbutrin does have slightly speedy effects  it could absolutely be causing your side effects  I would not suggest changing your dose until you can get a hold of your doctor  who should lower your dose or take you completely off it  Mirena checking in  I've launched into severe depressions on the pill  so when i needed bc I went straight to Mirena  Hurts like a bitch when they put it in  but no period at all makes it so worth it  I have the odd rogue cramp that can be painful  but the longer I have it  the fewer I get them    However  this is made possible by latuda  The miracle iud gives me ovarian cysts which are at the least uncomfortable and at most very painful  But latuda tends to fuck with lady hormones  and when I started it  the cysts stopped  Without the latuda  I'd probably have to have the iud yanked and go back to feminine products like a neanderthal  Haha  And then only because I'm lucky enough to now have a husband willing to have a vascectomy if needed     Edit  I should also add that I never really struggled with pms  so nothing really changed for me when I started the iud   This guy is right This is great  I can relate how depression can stop you from doing things  so I'm proud of you   Why is a little awkwardness and shyness seen as the worst thing ever  Like come on  I'll try and be be polite and nice  But nope  I guess being quiet is worse than murder  Oh my goodness     This is physical and emotional abuse  Please tell someone and don't believe anything these sick guys are telling you    I am so so so sorry this happened and believe me  it's not your fault  the tough years are stacking I don't know where to write it  but I accidentally created the same topic few times  aome net reaction problem  all I can handle lately is tycho hahaha  Like others have said  go ahead  just don't abuse it  Try not to smoke until you have finished everything you have to do for the day and then  you can relax and smoke  Also how do I tell her  that I like her  I wanna do it in person of course  but I am scared  that if she doesn't like me as well  she will feel awkward  Holy shit bro you just blew my mind  like I knew they were similar but wtf you just made them the SAME thank you for this  I've felt the exact same way about my poetry   song writing  I feel as though the stories need to be told in order for me to let go   but really it's just me refusing to let go of those hurtful memories  I don't know what else to write but I'll try  Yep  that's just the thing that made me hold up  a friend introducing me to unity and releasing those games  I look forward to make something new  and i read the unity subreddit a lot  I really neved asked anyone for help in commercial games because i never wanted to have someone working unpaid or underpaid  suffered of that one a lot myself and never wanted to be one of those people   I figure this year 'll have to force myself to interact more on those subs   Thank you for your replies  i really appreciate that you took the time to answer      same with the people who pm'd  you guys are great   I'm trying to use the rational part of my brain and IL just wait I guess I don't want to ruin this  it's very hard not to message her she's online and sharing stuff  but I don't know what's going on etc so il wait and hope for the best  My wife is leaving me I'm just gonna wait it out  she seemed happy so I hope for the best You'll find something  I'm sure of it Oh I see  thanks for elaborating  I don't really see myself making music for a living although I do enjoy playing at home  really it's more that I don't see how I could make money with music considering my average skill   Still  thanks for the message Thanks   And to you as well   Just try not to beat yourself up too much  I'm constantly setting goals for myself and I'm also constantly fucking up  Today I slept in until 9am when I   meant   to get up at 5am    But it's not a problem because more often than not  I   am   getting up when I need to    All my life I've been terrified of failure  but I'm starting to learn that it's really not that bad because at least I tried   This internet stranger wishes you the best  and if you ever need someone to talk to  don't be afraid to message me   I have Skyla  smaller  3 year IUD  and I like it for the most part except I do have pretty bad cramps and minor mood swings  It didn't effect my flow hardly at all except maybe made it more regular   I would recommend taking advil or some type of pain killer about 30 minutes to an hour before your appointment  idk about everyone else but it was painful for me for the first couple days  You can tell us Here I hate not being able to use depression as a legitimate reason for my behavior  My family doesn't understand it  My best friend does  he's coming over tonight    I've been smoking a lot of weed lately because it's kind of immediate meditation and the only way I can do anything or even enjoy my time  I've been a recluse in my apartment alone all winter break because I don't want to go home  My parents just stress me out and have me on edge 100  of the time    I cried this morning because I don't have the motivation or energy to go get groceries or food or get my hair cut  They all seem like ridiculously large tasks  It's all really fucking tough    I dropped 9 15 hours last semester because I didn't go to those classes and now I have to take 18 hours a semester to graduate  Which is way too fucking much for me but I don't have any other option  I quit my job two days ago to focus on myself and school and my parents were disappointed  Everything is just a huge fucking disappointment  When your body's system is unacquainted with an unknown med  it will exhibit side effects   Give it a few more days so your body can get used to the drug  that is IF you can bare it   If the nausea and anxiety continues after the aforementioned few more days  contact your prescriber or doctor   They'd more than likely move you onto a different form of anti depressant  as some depressants are not for everyone    Hope this helps  friend  Yes it is  the first two weeks of any type of anti depressant are hell  be patient   good luck   This is so jarring it borders on a trollpost  Listen OP  you dont understand now but when you are older you will understand what happened to you  Please tell tour parents and call the police as soon as possible so that those boys dont do what they did to you to someone else  This is very serious  woooah    what the hell  That therapist shouldn't be practising anymore   The thing that stuck out the most for me is speaking about no girl liking you because of your interests  never letting anyone know and moving your interests to an actual girl    what the hell   I feel like anyone with common sense  knowing that they're actually supposed to be helping you  would suggest that if you're uncomfortable with your interests you should explore them etc etc or whatever  not give you their opinion on it    jesus christ   Sorry you had to go through that  i don't have a history of abuse and I know that kind of behaviour would mess me up even if he was making fun of something not as private as your sexuality and sexual interests  but wow    that sucks   Hope you're feeling better  When I went on the first date with my bf  first time meeting  we met online  I completely fucked up our date  I ate so slow that we almost missed the movie  it started raining and pulled out my unbrella  only to stab him in the eye with it  I talked through the whole movie  i was nervous and I don't do well with silence  we went to the book store and got super excited about baby stuff and kept pointing it out to him  failed to mention that my best friend was pregnant and I was thinking of the stuff for her  we went to the fireworks and I wasn't paying attention and didn't sit next to him  I felt awkward getting up and moving  so I stayed there  but  we are now engaged and getting married in october     the right person will see past all the awkward and 'bad' things  I promise  You didn't give consent and or were incapable of giving consent  which legally constitutes rape  I hope you will call the police immediately to report this   I find it beyond difficult to meet people  I've been told I seem cold and disinterested but it's more I don't know what to say and I stay very in control of my emotions so i don't really show much  I felt kind of down the last few days because the mere few friends i have were out partying on New Years Eve  while I stayed in and drank wine with my folks and dog     Kind of wish i was out there with people my age   Oh well  there's always this year      I remember hearing about someone working for the hotline telling someone to just go through with it  Can't remember if the person actually did  but it just shows that not just anyone should be working those lines     Stay strong  Remember  it is just a feeling  It's not you  You will get past this  whatever it is you are going through  The fact that you are still here and able to reach out to this community is proof that you still have at least a little hope and that you CAN persevere  They manipulate you  You're not the bad guy  you didn't give them permission  and they abused you  No matter what anyone else says you are a victim of a grotesque crime  and something needs to be done about this  or else they might do this to someone else I'm a weight lifting fanatic but I do find it far to draining some days  I find it best to have a minimum I can do each time and then other exercises that I do if I feel up to it  It does suck when I have a bad run which ends up being a handful of sets in a week  Being around my family for the holidays is triggering  I slept with my highschool sweetheart  it's been ten years  and it was magical except that now he's distant  I feel all kinds of fucked up and lonely  I've only rung and got through to one once  She seems very disinterested and for some reason kept asking who else was with me  Which was no one as I was sat in a park alone at night  Exactly    you're not going to die  OP  It's not like in the movies  You're just going to be miserably ill  Might as well go to the ER and get charcoal to sop it all up so your pointless suffering is reduced to hours and not days  Been going like what I feel is depressed for several years now  never told anyone in my life       Here's a sneak peek of  r ptsd  using the top posts of all time        1   Only a doctor can diagnose you

they act like that towards someone who is feeling suicidal  I really cannot understand how a fellow human can do that to another person  It isn't your fault though  nothing is wrong with you and you aren't worthless  Don't let those people bring you even more down  They don't deserve your pain  They literally have no humanity left in them  I understand how frustrating not being able to do anything about distance can be  but don't get too mad for something you can't change  at least yet  it will just get worse for nothing  I'll send you a message tomorrow for sure   Thank you man  I can even begin to explain how much I appreciate it  As far as talking  I am probably going to try and calm myself down right now  but I'd love to talk sometime later today or tomorrow  I am pretty much at a loss for words right now  I sometimes get the feeling I'm screaming so loud in my mind but on outside I'm calm  That feeling is horrible  Talk to someone  I get the feeling when I feel bad I feel frustrated and angry and can't cry so screaming feels like a good release  I've heard a lot of unfortunate things about it  too  Surprised it's workin for me  I'm thankful but  ya know   It's true   if someone meets you for the first time and they have a bad opinion of you for some reason the changes of that person wanting to get to know the qualities you have are slim  But still   we have to have hope here  Not everyone acts like that   some people realize that not only what's in the surface is the real person  So they try to get to know as you are  I don't know if you can do DBT fully by yourself but I have a DBT workbook for anxiety   I haven't tried DBT in a "real life" setting but that workbook is great    It is very emotionally taxing though   I can only make it through one chapter at a time before I need a break to feel less overwhelmed   It's been immensely helpful though  Well I had and it was not really effective  at some point they were slightly less awful but since I have uni and a work besides it went back to the same  Thanks  I'll look at it  I'm so sorry man I think about suicide these days  It comforts me   OH HELL TO THE YES APPETITE FOR DESTRUCTION IS THE BEST ALBUM EVER HANDS DOWN and it's   really   awesome to see another aspiring astrophysicist who likes the same music as me like dude we're practically best friends now  Call the police  I wish I could relate to it  hans zimmer is fucking fantastic  the music he wrote for interstellar is just incredible and i understand why it motivates you  i listen to his stuff all the time while i'm drawing or writing  it just gives my inspiration a boost ykno what i mean  and lamb of god are incredible too  walk with me in hell is my favorite song by them so far  i'll check explosions in the sky out sometime cause i'm always on the hunt for more music Chalk it up to last year  That's fu   sorry to hear  drums look so hard to master and i'm really happy to hear that they helped you  i'm sure they'll help again you just gotta hang in there as overused as that sounds  also if you've not seen the movie whiplash you really should  it's about an aspiring jazz drummer struggling with mental illness and an asshole teacher      Me too  Makes me feel like I'm a failure at real life  As in I'm too weak to get along with the real world so I look for an escape  And all the thing I dream of are practically impossible   everyone in this thread seems to feel better after a good dose of rock and metal and it makes me live honestly  it's good to see a bunch of people with the same music taste as me around you know  That's for other inmates  Like if someone in the prison says they're going to kill themselves  the prison will assign a trusted inmate to sit in their room and keep an eye on them so they can call for help if the person makes an attempt  They're not talking to suicidal people on the outside   The people who do the hotlines are volunteers  As the saying goes "you get what you pay for " Some of these people are caring  dedicated people who are intelligent enough to help you  Some of them    aren't  You get community service hours for volunteering so some people are just doing it to get through court sanctioned community service  or to look good on a college app or whatever and don't actually care about the service they're providing or even understand it  i don't listen to ambient but this just made me want to give this genre a try  who knows it might be just what i need  i'll check out all these artists and maybe give a little update if i get into them everyone could use some classical music sometime  good choice imo you sound a lot like me honestly  and i'm really happy to hear that guitar's making you feel better  it really does help you know like it's a distraction but also something really incredible to do and i'd love to hear what you think of the songs i mentioned when you listen to them  it says not available  can you try another link  i just checked it out  it's definitely going in my playlist now  Kinda like hugging the pillow at night  mimicking her presence and then later crushing it towards your body  sobbing and crying because it's not real  Yeah   Happy Birthday    I felt pretty down on my birthday too  I just turned 19 and Suicide doesn't seem so bad after all  I just turned 19  my "friends" are also fed up with me and my mental illness  I don't know what to do anymore  all I could do is cry myself to sleep  smoke some good weed  and repeat  Happy Birthday  No one knows    The sad thing is that depressed me is so close to normal me that nobody notices    Nobody notices that I can't sleep  Nobody really cares if I don't leave the house in weeks  Nobody notices that on good days I manage to put two hours into my work  currently from home     Beside my therapist there are only two people who know it  I've asked each of them for help  One of them is very experienced and probably could help me a bit  But she doesn't have any time and currently doesn't has the strength to bear listening to this misery  The other one was well meaning but started talking about the autumn weather when I brought depression up  It was pointless  Have a wonderful womb exodus reminiscence day  I see it as it takes more effort to get to know someone shy or awkward  There's so many other people who are able to connect with others right away so it's not always worth the time to try to force someone open  You can tell a therapist absolutely anything and not worry about them being able to take it   Woo keep it up  try to aim for an extra 2 each week    always slowly but surely  I'm sorry    If you ever want to talk to a stranger I'm here  I wish I could smoke some goddamn weed  medication has ruined that for me haa Happy Birthday   Try find the tiny positive in the day  that helps me  Happy Birthday   Mine is coming up pretty quick  Gonna be another day where nothing happens   I wanna be happy  I do  I get constant feelings of longing and just    can't get it out of my head  Drawing helps me    I've been going through the same feelings myself  Trust is a big part of it  Like the commenter before explained   For me  I needed to learn how to love myself again  Which sounds cheesy  buts it true  Try writing  get a journal  find writing prompts  questions that you need answered  or a story about yourself  I am

help you explore your feelings without the worry of telling someone else  It's a good first step  Then you can work up to opening up to your significant other   If you're bad at "chatting up girls" and only of average hotness  you will likely never get someone who is interested Hi  It's hard to tell does someone has depression or not  There is so many symptoms  not sure about this word   and they are really personal  Some people are sad and can't get up from bed but sometimes it's really hard to see what's going on    It's important to listen what he wants to tell you because you may be the only persons he's trusting in his sitiation  He can also be scared of telling his family for some reason  For example I haven't told my parents or my brother cause I don't want them to be worried  It's nice he can talk to you cause it only makes thins worse when you can talk with no one  Try to inspire him to go see some specialist  They can tell if he really is depressed and can give him the help he needs    The situation is also really hard for you guys as his friends but I'm really glad you are trying to help him  Be patient with your friend  depression is really a shit and no one can beat it alone  Be strong with him  I'm sure you are a good friend  Beware you don't sink in the same boat as many of us are sinking    Ps  sorry my english  and sorry I'm not a good writer really It's settled  what grade are you in right now  and do you play any instruments yourself   Indeed  Two and a half years here  and still counting     I can relate  I take sick days to sleep occasionally  Honestly  I'd disclose your illness  maybe to your boss or someone higher  Someone who you think will be sympathetic  As long as your sick days aren't impacting your work performance  which it doesn't sound like they are   I'd say it'll be fine i'm in tenth grade and majoring in programming  its not as fancy as it sounds i'm not a genius lmao  and i play guitar i guess but i'm no jimmy page  I'm sorry you're feeling this way  I just turned 19  been through 8 Electroconvulsive Therapy Procedures  been prescribed meds and nothing worked  I never had a girl attracted to me  ever   I can't even begin to imagine how you're feeling   I'm so terribly sorry  Stay strong  and be strong for your father and sister  they will need it   I have been hinting the idea of having a dog puppy in the house  but my boyfriend isn't that thrilled  I think it'd help with my ongoing depression   ptsd as in the past  dogs made me happy  We're in the process of remodeling  so having a pet is probably not a great idea   I've been through 8 Electroconvulsive Therapy Procedures and nothing has helped me  c a l l   t h e   p o l i c e   Don't let those rapists and bullies get away with it and make you feel as if it was your fault   But i feel like its pointless if i see a therapist for only 1hour a week because then it would take several weeks until he knows all the things that i told my friend in just a couple of days    And as im not an adult yet im afraid that they would just say "oh yeah thats a typical teenager thing" or some shit like that   No  you're not a slut or any of the other negative things they called you  Report them to the police because not only did they rape you  but they obviously assaulted a minor  I'm sorry     As much as you feel down  you need to call the police as soon as you can  Feelin' like crap  I don't have any friends in real life and this constant silence and loneliness is killing me from inside out  I've been where you are now  I've had health care professionals fail me when I was at my most desperate for help  I wish there was easy advice for me to give you  but it really always comes back to not giving up  Break up your problems and deal with them in pieces  one thing at a time  Learn to talk to yourself in a positive way  You are not "subhuman trash" or "the girl who can't even get a suicide hotline to listen " You are someone's reason for smiling  You have something incredible and unique to contribute to the world  Even if you don't know it  It takes time and agonizing efforts to get through a bad round of depression but please  DON'T GIVE UP  Just focus on the next thing     Fu k   is as if I was reading my own words   Would love to give you a hug  man    A simple 'I don't feel too good these days' sounds like it might get the job done  Or maybe 'I'm feeling down and pretty bad about myself right now'  Simple   but gets the job done  Listen to this person as well  If you feel like you need to talk to someone  there's nothing wrong with seeking help from a therapist despite the seemingly negative stigma  It's perfectly normal to talk to a therapist  and they're there to help you  Understanding ourselves is one of the hardest challenges we face in life  We do things we never would have expected  and things we want to know are kept in the dark to us  The reason I'm saying this is that I felt the same as you for a long time    but I see now  that not having felt passion does not mean you can't    And it's hard to find these things  to understand yourself    but it is possible     Don't give up  try some new things  Think  This world is vast  there is something  maybe extend your experiment for a little longer  i'd say 3 months  you need time to get through the bad part  have your mind calm down and get bored  then pick itself up again and start getting engaged in stuff   it really only began happening to me around the 8th week  then i became more curious about the world and my own involvement in it and started picking things back up   once you start doing things again  you can start rewarding yourself with a bit at night for a day well spent  Continuing to live is not a weakness  Staying alive takes effort  Every day    Yes  Keep going  You've started  and that's the hardest part   You obviously feel the need to tell someone  a therapist is a choice  find another friend  pm me I feel dead inside already and have listened to other people before  Just don't hold it in  it doesn't seem like it does  but that stuff builds up over time  I know from personal experience   Yes tell them  If you think they won't understand  start doing some research to provide them  It took a while for my family to really really understand  And although my mom is sad that I have to live like this  she also has been very supportive  And you need that  Medicinally and emotionally   I always say "I'm still breathing "     Don't have to lie and say you're fine  which seems to pile up  over time  and it's pretty clear what you're feeling  particularly with a little sardonic inflection   It also says that you're not particularly pleased by the fact of the statement   But it doesn't also necessitate further information if none is needed thus avoiding the "what's the matter "   Especially if it's not something specific   People don't respond to "nothing   " like you might expect     edit    I should have said "would ordinarily use" as I've actually been feeling better to a degree recently   After years    wooo    lately I've been saying "not bad"  I'm a 35 y o female    Major Depression   PTSD   Insomnia   Cymbalta   I was on it for one day and I was so amped up shaky   couldn't focus  I just wanted to run a marathon   Lexapro   10 mg   Current  3 months now    Non existent sex drive  I get annoyed very easily  very nauseous  trouble sleeping  dizzy  still feel very depressed but able to laugh sometimes  and it's genuine   suicidal  digestive issues  That's all I can think of right now    Ambien   5 mg   Current  3 months now    dizziness  violent nightmares  suicidal thoughts  Hey  would you be willing to keep talking about it  What are you testing for     Happy birthday    Not your fault  It doesn't matter what they say  They took advantage of you and if they can trick you into not calling the police on them  they'll try it  You can't listen to them after what they did  I'm so sorry this happened  Please contact authorities  OP  Don't let them walk away from this  Depends on the meds  Talk to your doc Even IF you chose to drink as much as you did  it's not your fault for them raping you   A   You're under 18  and they're legally adults   B   You were drunk  and that means that  by law  you were incapable of consenting to what happened   C   These guys sound emotionally and physically manipulative and abusive  Combine that with their age with respect to yours  and they're banking on making you believe that they're right for their own benefits  No matter who the other person is  you're never going to be these horrid things that you're being called   You're not to blame for anything that happened  They are responsible for every single aspect     Yes    I mean  I think so  I just feel so    lost    One day when i was a young child  like 7 or 8  I realized my parents were going to die  And since that moment this continuous existencial crisis mixed with a big hatred towards myself and the world has been growing  I don't know what to do    I had never told anyone how I felt until a few nights ago when i was in a really bad place and i decided it was time to take a step forwards and seak help  So i told my 3 best friends  And now I feel even more awful cause I think they just think i'm crying for attention  because they never thought someone like me could be so dark     So i dont know if this qualifies as depression  I don't even know if this is just a normal thing that everybody feels and i'm just being a drama queen  But i do not feel ok  and I don't know what it's like to feel truly ok in a long while    I wish I did  I wish I knew Inspiteration  Don't let the world ruin that special day of yours   I know too well how lonely it can feel  Remember my answering a question on a group therapy session to say what is good about my birthday   so I said that 'luckily it occurs only once a year'   Accept happy birthday from a stranger   Treat yourself with something nice   Go out  let it by walk down the park or coffee and cake   anything that you don't do for yourself on every day  Anything  Call the authorities immediately  You where raped  your not a slut  your not disgusting  you are a person who was taken advantage of  The sooner you get tests run on you the better    Chin up  you can get past this  they are the broken ones you are a victim  don't blame yourself they are criminals and will pay for it but only if you act fast    Its not fair  but you can save others the sooner you alert the authorities  good luck  I rejected to hang out 10 times with 5 different groups of friends over the past 10 days  I feel so tired just thinking about going out  but then I sit alone feeling drained and lonely  What a paradox  Pretty sure they just think that I'm an asshole  they don't think I'm depressed one bit  I hide it well   God damn  this is dramatic af   No one should have to be alone without anyone  But some of us end up alone somehow  It's happened to me too  I have two dogs who help a lot  They force me to go outside and walk a lot in nature and I struggle onward somehow  I'm no inspiration  Lost alone confused and so on  I don't know why I persist but I do  I'm getting pretty old too  I guess it's inertia and low standards  Your desire not to endure too much pain is understandable to me  Sometimes suffering leads to creativity and wonderful art or insights but it's a high price to pay  The definition of rape is black and white  sex without consent  and consent cannot be given while inebriated  edit  too drunk to consent  which means when you don't feel like you're in complete control  essentially    There's no gray area at all  The names they're calling you and their denial are to emotionally manipulate you  None of the bad things they're saying are true   EDIT  Plus  you're under age  and they're 18 or older  That's a crime in itself so they're already to blame  They're the adults in this situation and they took advantage of you  They have double the blame in this case   http   everydayfeminism com 2016 05 alcohol and consent questions  I totally understand you   For me  I day dream  ruminate  and have mental conversations with an old ex  It's consumed me and heaped on depression  and I think it's a huge problem that has kept me in depression  So I started looking into Cognitive Behavioral Therapy  Check it out  if you haven't already  The gist is by changing your thoughts you can change the way you feel and behave  but it takes a lot of practice and being present  That's the key for me  being present  In this way I can control myself and not get stuck in the future or the past   Good luck  I'm sorry  Message me if you'd like to talk  This is not only rape but rape of a minor  In some states there are no Romeo and Juliette laws and the people would be persecuted like adults raping a child  which is who you are  Not ok    Report and file a police report  Go to an emergency room  Save the clothes that you wore  I hope they weren't washed or thrown away  so that a rape kit of some kind can be done   You need mental and physical help  And there are places for that    Tell your parents   Tell your school   Tell the police  I used to be super shy and socially awkward  And since lots of girls were attracted to me  there were countless very awkward situations where there were expectation on me to make a step  my inside shouting at myself to do the bloody step   but I never did  I'm much older now  shyness somewhat lessen  but I've mastered the art of awkwardness  But I  don't give a damn about it anymore  And I like it about myself  And true is that this days outspoken people are popular ones and quiet ones are looked down on    In situations like this the Internet is golden  Learn to not hold back when chatting online   I met my girlfriend at a friend's party where I didn't say a word  Found her the next day through people tagging pictures    She says I was the worst first date she has ever had because I didn't talk at all  As soon as it ended I was able to tell her I had a good time  and that I had severe social anxiety   We have now been dating for 8 years     Anything off this playlist I made  https   www youtube com playlist list PLl7XKKbkBsVgZoxBM6eLSoXkfj9iZx Cc   The stories in the songs are so immersive and distracting  and the songs are so beautiful   Weird  it works for me  Try this   https   www youtube com watch v LqUFMZcatEQ Thanks  I have to check out that movie   I'm not saying I will be an amazing drummer  but I know I'm capable   It would be an absolute waste not to persue it further especially when I enjoy it so much  this makes a ton of sense  thanks for getting back to me  I'll try to reach out to him more when I can  Hopefully I can get him to see a specialist rather than a psychologist  that way he can get diagnosed  I'm so so sorry  You didn't do anything wrong  and I'm sure your mother would not want you feeling that way  She would want you to continue to work on getting better and being healthy  because I'm sure she loved you and your sister more than anything in the world   If you are a software developer why don't you start trying to work remotely  you can travel the world with you laptop and work at the same time  Aren't there a decent amount of developers that do this sort of thing  I'd get a second opinion  University doctors will be used to students coming to see them and trying to get medical excuses for things  Can you see a non university doctor   to earn well with this you have to be at the top and I fear I will never achieve it   Very  very few people make it to the top  Don't forget that  A lot of people never even make it to a semipro level  Those that do are the ones that dedicate their life to the game from a young age  You have to put in a lot of extra hours crafting your body and skill and it's not something a lot of people have the discipline for  If it was easy  there'd be a lot more players making a lot less money     There are no studies and no jobs that would please me  that I would like  but I have to work or study now  If you can't become a pro player in your sport can you get involved with the sport another way  Work at a recreation center or a stadium so you can be at the games  even if you're working you can be around what you love  Then spend your time playing in an amateur league with friends or coworkers  What about sports reporting  Go to watch games  analyze stats  players  and plays  There's other ways to be around sports without playing    I wish I was never born or I died quickly and painlessly What the hell to do   Refocus your life  If you want to get involved with sports  try and contact some potential places for work  Find out what you can do to get involved  Maybe you have to start off with a random job that doesn't seem like what you want  but you can get promoted or meet people with new opportunities for you  Set small goals for yourself and accomplish a goal every day  Occasionally reward yourself  Try and make yourself happy first and things will come together  Good luck with everything   Im gonna think about it tomorrow and try to make up my mind  Thank you I get you  Growing up with issues  one of the number one things that made me feel like shit was the idea that I was different       it almost makes me wonder if you might be better off seeking treatment outside of the army  Would they let you could you get away with it  Take it out of their hands  I dunno  crazy idea  PM me if you need to talk to someone  I suppose something that's more like a day to day thing  Something that could make me feel like I'm leading a satisfying life   Sounds wierd  but if you are getting "brain zaps"  take a benadryl   It helps a little  Just thought I would throw that out there as I think there is nothing worse then brain zaps   Also  try the app medisafe for your phone or tablet  it really helps with remembering tour meds  This is why we need basic income  This is rape  Is there a rape hotline you can call  Many offer free counseling services    This was not your fault  Rape is not about sex it is about control  How you look or act has nothing to do with it  I'm really sorry this happened to you  as fellow survivor I know some of the emotions you're feeling right now    Do you feel comfortable telling your parents  Or at least asking to see a therapist   I may be able to find another  read  closer  family doctor  although it may take some time to find one here    I've considered going to a walk in clinic to explain what's been going on and see if they can refer me elsewhere  but I don't know if that's allowed   Do not contact him  He is harrassing  bullying and abusing you  They are responsible for their actions  and their actions are appalling  Can you call a rape hotline  I can find you a number  hold on  Rape is not about sexual attraction it is about control  They are insulting you in order to silence you  They think that if they can trick you into thinking it was not rape they can 1  do it again and 2  not get in trouble    Block them  Do not read their messages  You are going through enough right now  you do not need to be reading their nasty  abusive messages as well  They are trying to get inside your head   Thank you     There was so much more to post   But it started get scattered     With a few breakdowns while typing     The kids will be gone soon    I don't want to make that anymore painful on them    At this point    I don't know    Maybe    I just don't know   Thanks for the feedback  I'll try it out Thanks for the love  That's really good advice about the gym  I know it was always just about getting started  then there's this point where you kind of hit a certain percentage of your maximum heart rate and something in your brain clicks  and you want to go faster and work harder  I know what you're talking about   And omg  same  I hate taking stuff too personally  It's like with me and people teasing or being annoying  Like  I know they're just trying to have fun and that's their style of being a friend  but all I can think is like  why are you laughing at me  how do you think that makes me feel  do you think that's appropriate or wanted  I actually tried making myself laugh along once  and the person I did it to still remembers   it came out like something from a Hitchcock movie  really messed up and scary sounding    I might be guilty of being a little too harsh with some of my friends  I'm mates with a lot of people who are struggling with stuff  and sometimes you can see all too clearly what it is they're struggling with  and every time you tell them they have to quit that brutal job  that recruiters are trying to scoop them out of daily  and move to the city where their friends live  that they can easily afford   you're less and less inclined to spend the time running around them and coaxing them into moving their ass      eeeeh  I maybe suck a bit  Every survivor wants an answer to this question  But there really are no answers  You'll drive yourself crazy trying to find out 'why'  Maybe there is no reason  they might not even know why they did it     Well   I guess I have    But  as you can tell  it only means letting someone close so they can hurt you more     It's possible but sounds way better than it actually is  Unless the amount of work isn't too much  it is very stressful to be travelling and working remotely at the same time  you end up not having much time to see the places you go to because of the deadlines you have to meet and it's hard to focus because you're in a foreign place   you spend more time just figuring out how to do basic things like where and how to use the laundry  where to buy groceries  find a place to live  etc  Still something that's on my mind for sure  but I don't think life is as good as it sounds when working remotely It's definitely not your fault and those boys are horrible people who broke the law   Please talk to people about this  your situation will get better if you do  This includes reporting it to the police  You did nothing wrong so don't be afraid of any consequences   Also I strongly advise you to go to an ER to let yourself check up  for example  on any possible STDs  OP here is a link to resources please call them   They have free couseling services and support groups as well as a hotline    https   centers rainn org If I could manage to have nice dreams every night  almost half of my life would be awesome   D Freshman in high school or college  If HS  you can get a work permit at 15 I think  You're supposed to have one as long as you're working and under 18  As for finding one at that age most people I know went into food or retail  Coffee shops  fast food  some with cars did pizza delivery  Theaters usually higher younger people  They're simple jobs that don't require a lot of training and younger employees help keep younger crowds coming in  There should be someone at your school like a counselor with info on work permits   Edit  its also great that you want to work  Having the money can give you more breathing room with bills and you can start building some retirement money  Plus having the experience will help get better jobs  Just remember you don't have to save everything  If all you do is work and your money goes right back out to food bills rent etc  work will become a burden  Put aside a little bit each paycheck as a whatever fund  It wont be much at first but after a few months you'll have a good bit of change set aside  Wanna go for a weekend getaway  Do it  Looking for a new TV  Buy it  I usually set aside  100 month and typically buy something I'd wanted after a few months but couldn't normally justify  Worked out well  I still had some other money to go out to eat or do things  but I got a "big reward" every few months  I'm in such a state that meeting with friends is hard  Forget about strangers  oh hey that's cool as hell  D  Congratulations  I have felt for a long time that I can neither be loved nor love another person   I've never had a girlfriend  so I can't pretend to have any relationship problems  but I also don't feel that I love any of my friends or family   I am just hollow and broken  He'll fuck up eventually  They always do  You are not a slut  They unfairly took advantage with you and should be prosecuted as adults for rape  Feel better  I get this feeling all of the time and I only work part time right now  I hope I can find a job that is tolerable and doesn't make me just want to stay at home and do nothing all of the time  Please call the police and give them every name and address of these guys  they raped you and deserve to go to jail  This was not your fault they are bad people   even if the responsibilities and the terror builds back up  at least you're still here to deal with them when you're able to  it doesn't have to be right away  tell your worries to fuck off for a minute   thanks for choosing not to go through with it  the lighter times Will come  eventually It's so scary to think how short our lives are  and how much time we waste on work  and other things we hate  Seriously makes me envy hobos lol First impression is very important  If you reveal trust issues right off the bat  then that's all people are going to know you for  the guy they can't trust or rely on  It then becomes a battle to convince them otherwise  But then you have people who are really good at clicking with people quickly  only to be an unreliable person in the long run  They are unreliable because they are popular  Socially awkward people are reliable in the long run because they are unpopular  Yet unreliable at first  again because they are unpopular  You are caring  helpful  sincere and hard working because you are bad at meeting people  You have to be a good guy to the people in your life because without them you'd have nobody Please don't do it  I just read a comment from you helping others and teaching them that life is worth living don't do it  3 we got you  I'm shooting myself before my next birthday  Happy Birthday   One thing that got me through one of my deepest depressions was sending a mass email out to all of my family members  I attached my resume and explained that I needed a change  I ended up with a new low level brainless job where I had not one but two family members to be around   I would suggest something along these lines since you have stated that you need a job and your family is genuine   This is EXACTLY how I am feeling lately  I feel like I just woke up from autopilot mode from the last 10 years  I have no idea how to lead my life moving forward or why I am doing what I am doing now   Humans are hardwired for social hierarchy  but some are not  It's ok if you aren't  fuck them  Seek comfort and friendliness elsewhere  Your cat is a great place to start      That certainly is a concern  The government does not give enough money to live  comfortably  off of  So she may still have to do on call work or freelance in order to help provide  there may be a limit on how much she can earn before it's deducted from the disability cheque each month     Of course it's all dependent on your SO and how she is  but I suspect so long as she maintains socialising with family and friends  participating in hobbies  does the things she was doing prior to disability recognition the transition may be easier   Personally I had have the problem you feared  I was severely socially isolated to begin with  so getting the disability recognition meant I even more so that I didn't have a reason to try and socialise  This made my depression worse  which killed any and all motivation to do anything I should have been doing  I saw the same thing happen to my friend who also has bipolar  And in both our cases the motivation loss lasted about a year before a change was needed   You know as Mark Twain said  "The more I learn about people  the more I like my dog " Yup  fuck humans  EXACTLY how I am feeling  Absolutely dredding work tomorrow   Make it a game  The longer you can stay alive  the more points you are rewarded  The more points you are rewarded  the closer you are to beating the battle against depression and suicide  Stay strong  Remember  you didn't do anything wrong  As sucky as it sounds  stuff like this in most cases is out of our hands  Our world is strange  cruel  unexpectable and generally sometimes non sensical in it's way by who gets taken away from us  But i'm sure your mother loved you  and knew the way you loved her  I can't fathom the pain you're probably going through  but stay strong  I believe in you  Your opinion is not needed here  Please leave OP alone  To reiterate what others are saying   it doesn't matter what you were wearing  They raped you  You have zero blame  That's all depression is  one never ending internal scream    I hope you manage to heal your pain   Are you sure you're not still slightly hypomanic and too optimistic about thinking you can afford it   If you can still return it  I would return it and stick with the original plan  You're just 15  They clearly abused you  tell your parents and call the police  Oh my god   Iam so so soooo so sorry for you  I can't even imagine the pain you have to go through right now  But you have to be there for your family  Don't be alone too much and do stuff that distracts you  Your mother would want you to be happy  Iam here if you need to talk  Sadly  this is very true  The only reason why I have some friends  is because we're equal when it comes to how awkward we are  Everyone else kind of avoids us  because of how awkward we are  Another reason why everyone avoids us  is because of the jokes we like to tell each other  They involve a lot of video game movie YouTube video references that a lot of people don't understand  In fact  a lot of people can't even tell when we're joking  Therefore  they get weird first impressions of us  It sucks  but whatever  I don't care about meeting new people anymore  I'm good with the few friends I have   If what you've said is true  then these fuckers belong behind bars  I'm sorry this happened to you  Tell the police  a teacher  your parents  somebody about this  Thanks   It's easy to tell someone that life is worth living and I look around me and see happy people everywhere that obviously think that is true  so it must be  right   Today is a bit better but I still can't shake the desire to fly to Mexico for a bottle of Nembutol   Thankfully I'm a ways off from that   Thank you for reaching out   It helped me today  I feel you dude     Yeah  though just the last few months for me after separating from my family  I still can't figure out how to get over losing that much  even if they weren't good for me  YES  I love my dog  He's a good boy all the time  but holy cow  was he ever a super good boy after a bad incident a couple of weeks ago   If I could  I would own so many animals because they're just amazing  unfortunately it costs money and I would want to be able to spend all the time with them that they deserve  you know   And you know how people say you need to surround yourself with positive people  Yeah  that would be animals   I don't know what we did to deserve such amazing friends  I mean the animals of course  because fuck people   but sometimes it really makes me feel as though I don't deserve it and I wonder if my dog knows I love him to death and back although he's not exactly "mine"  family dog   You're not a slut  They raped you  Contact the police ASAP  I did the same  but I was home alone  fun    but it felt 10x better than going out and having to fake being happy about another 4 digit number that contains  365 days  Maybe I'm used to it now  Not really  but ouch that sounds like it hurts     Sounds familiar    Do your best to get out of your shell  be brave  be persistent and if nothing works  and you see no hope  move somewhere else  and start a new life  It's even worse if you aren't caring  helpful  sincere or hard working  It's not your fault  On the lighter side   there is an episode in the '90s series "My So Called Life" where the most messed up teenaged character ends up volunteering for the suicide hotline for all the wrong reasons   They dealt with it well   If you're up for it  check it out  and it might cheer you up  Most people have no idea of what it's like to be depressed  whether they are a professional or a volunteer   Everyone is an amateur at their job  the good ones are trying to be better than they were   It is not you   Call another line  reach out another way as you have here   It's not your fault  That's really inspirational  Thanks for the advice  it's nice to know I'm not the only one  Damn  man    I hope things keep going well  THIS  Holy shit  this   Nobody gives a fuck about wanting to connect anymore  I'm in somewhat a similar position  and I'm not going to say talking to someone is going to be a magically relieving thing  but it is good for one thing  new ideas    Your issue is circular thinking  just like me  I'm in school raking up debt and I don't even have a major  with my grades slowly falling  sweeping away my chances at the transfer I want    I've seen a few counselors and they aren't very helpful to me  since  honestly  most of what they say I've already thought of  But sometimes my counselor or my family or my boyfriend will come up with something I hadn't thought of  an alternate thought path to consider   Imo  thinking yourself into a grave can really only be helped by having new thoughts  and talking to someone can inspire that  thus relieving a bit of that circularity  It's hard for me  because to a extent  it causes bad anxiety  I've tried several things to make it bearable but now it is mostly just the mental connection to the anxiety  rather than the anxiety   Whatever responsibilities are overdue have to wait until you're better   Have you let anyone in your life know how badly off you are   Is there someone you can talk to   Please get help and drop everything else until you've found some  That's fucking disgusting  I hope the lady feels ashamed  They're dealing with people who are about to take their life and then they just neglect the person and make them feel worse  What a shitty excuse of a human being  That's something I plan to do on my next birthdays  Spending it with a whole lot of people that pretend to care is suffocating  Remember to have fun times with her  too  Things have to balance out somehow   I do know exactly what you're saying  though  A friend I'd been confiding into is getting to that point  too  Instead  I try to vent more on this reddit or something just to get it out of my system  Sometimes I also watch documentaries  or other things about depression or anything that's currently bothering me  When you see people struggle with what you do  you feel less alone  Usually  it pulls me back into reality and out of a really dark depressive episode   Reading posts on this reddit and responding to them does the same thing for me   Basically  I think you just need to find an additional coping mechanism to relieve from pressure from your friend  It will be okay    You can communicate emotions and complex messages without saying anything   That's definitely the beauty of art  A personal favorite is film  as the moving form of photography  an already lovely art in itself  cinematography is just so wonderful   Music is another  I find myself disappointed when works of music and film fail to connect with me  though what I connect with might be different from what others connect with  The connection is important for good storytelling      It's nothing to be proud of and I have to be very careful not to wear my illness as "medals"   It's nothing to be ashamed of  either  Don't worry  you don't have to wear it as a medal  Just know that your perspective is also of value to me and to others  I only seek to understand to the best of my ability      We can't even feel empathic for our own species  How can we expect that everyone accesses metaphysics and philosphy   Good point      Tardigrades are notable for being the most resilient animal  they can survive extreme conditions that would be rapidly fatal to nearly all other known life forms   Are those the extremophiles  badass organisms that prefer what we as humans would consider 'extreme conditions'      Why do males have to "earn" their sexuality   I haven't a clue as to why  I honestly think it's quite a ridiculous concept to force onto others  Someone's sexuality is not society's business    If you think about it  things could have gone the other way  if people had decided that gender roles would be opposite of what they are now  at a time when they were still being very actively incorporated into society  if that makes sense   things could have been very different  These concepts are so malleable  and often  people use a greater power than themselves to justify it  Sometimes people would rather use faith than reason or science to make their decisions      I'm not sure if I ever heard something comparable to women   The only thing I can think of as being similar is 'real women have curves'  However  people refute this idea much more often than people refute the idea that men must "prove" their sexuality  People will more often blindly accept the latter rather than the former  It really is unfortunate  to have a discussion about gender requires that both main genders be included  Otherwise  people tend to tune out and get stuck in their own world    Regardless  you definitely make a point  I don't become less of a female  less of a person  simply because I don't succeed  for instance  financially or otherwise      But a man that failed isn't even a man anymore   There are very few occasions in which a woman will be any less of a woman for failing  But we've set men to certain standards that shouldn't even define the whole of the person  i e   you have to have a well paying job and be the sole provider of the family's income   which isn't even very possible these days  and a lot of families have both parents working part or full time   that's probably why the idea is very slowly shifting  I hope    It is highly unfortunate that people are so close minded  I wonder if we've forgotten just how many variables play into the world and what happens in it    And now  to end this statement   I also wish you a  kind of somewhat belated  Happy New Year  Hopefully all goes well   Gave upvotes to a few comments already  but need to add something   Nah  I think I'm fucking fabulous and I'm isolated for no good reason  the person is just a judgmental douche  and or they're judging me for my appearance  I'll admit I'm not attractive    For fuck's sake  I was walking my dog the other night and met someone on the sidewalk  Their dog wanted to say hello to mine  and I said that's totally fine   Stranger  "Oh I'm so sorry he's just a pup and wants to play"  Me  "No problem at all  him too "  Stranger  "How old is yours "  Me  "10"  Stranger  from chill to pissy in 1 nanosecond  "I thought you said he's a pup"  Me  "Pup at heart  he likes to play "  Like holy fuck  you need to make clarifications and walk on eggshells with fucking everyone  I feel the same way often  Two of my most popular works came out of my worst times  But the reason isn't the depression itself  it's the fact that you were dealing with feelings you didn't know how to deal with  and you struggled to explain and explore them  It was the process of you trying to figure everything out that created something good  not just the state of being depressed  You can think new things and expierence new emotions while not depressed  and with those you can create something you're proud of I'm sure of it  Okay  How's their relationship with the person  This is a pretty good way to put it  I wonder whats making us smell the roses  Its inevitable that things will change if you continue to maintain that attitude about "wanting to shine' fuck yeah dude  Yeah its possible to be in a normal state for a year or so without depression and mania even if you do have bipolar and are not on medications  But the mania and depression eventually comes no doubt  Even with medication which just lessens the severity and frequency  Find something you like to do  Anything  Just some form of escapism that can distract you from your mind and what you're thinking  Trust me  once you find something you love to do  you will gradually start feeling better about yourself  I'm not quite there myself yet  but since discovering what makes me happy I'm starting to feel a hell of a lot better  One thing you cannot do is 100  rely on other people to fulfil your happiness  You need a balanced mixture of things   I have an orange cat too and he's such a pal  Sadly I moved to a shitty small apartment and he doesn't fit here  But I swear to god the only reason I visit my parents is because of him  I just lay in my bed and cuddle him and forget everything  It warms my heart to see how he misses me and truly enjoys my presence  He loves the scrubbing I give him    As someone who sometimes drink when I'm feeling down  this is the worst thing ever  It magnifies that despair SO HARD   Drinking is causing you problems  you need to try to do something about that  I don't know what it feels like to be addicted to alcohol or feel a "need" for it  so I don't want to suggest anything and be ignorant  Don't lose hope that you can apologize to people and rebuild things  Just remember that the most important component to an apology is telling your friend what you will do differently next time  and sticking to it  The thing is that I can open up and be comfortable around people  but it takes some time  Honestly  I'd say this a cultural problem   We're expected to be super open and talkative to complete strangers  but in many other cultures  like in most of Europe  people generally don't talk to strangers and aren't open with people until they get to know them  But if you get to know them over time and gain trust  you'll have made a friend for life   It's actually a real cultural phenomenon  Called the peach vs coconut   https   hbr org 2014 05 one reason cross cultural small talk is so tricky  Peach cultures  Very friendly and open on the surface  People talk easily to strangers  move to first name basis and open to asking personal questions  But quickly you hit the "pit" where the person will no longer reveal anything more   Coconut cultures  People are more closed off to strangers  they won't talk or ask many personal questions  But when you get to know them better and the relationship and friendship builds they'll become more open and treat you like family   I feel like I'm the latter stuck in a culture that's the former  And because of that  I'm not given a chance to build that relationship and trust  I really do feel very lost and unwelcome in North American culture  I don't really see that as being rude  more so asking for clarification which is something that happens a lot in normal conversation  To be honest  if someone told me their dog was a pup then said he was ten I would be somewhat confused as well   Of course  this is coming from my opinion and as far as I know he could have said it like a total asshole  just saying my thoughts  That sounds like mania to me  I'm guessing it just isn't talked about as much because it may not be as common as depression  or other things  But it is very real and I'm sure it can be debilitating  too   Too much of anything is awful  You need to see someone different  Not everyone understands  even if they're educated and should know better   Could you teach languages to other people  Or even try teaching English abroad because you have a desire to travel  I had it as a secret too  Until all knew at once that I want to see a therapist  It felt embarrassing  As if my clothes were pulled right from me  But I guess they were ok  I had cousins in deeper shit than me and I loved talking and sharing with them  My parents were a bit worse  because they had no clue how to help  But slowly I made it clear that giving me space is the best they can do  And things generally went better  They've become much more free with me and have no control over my life anymore  I feel free thanks to that  That's terrible  I had a bad experience with a line as well  Sometimes people just get into it for the wrong reasons  they don't have the compassion or other qualities you need to do a job like that well   sorry that happened to you   Don't rely on women for happiness  It won't end well   Re read     Stranger  from chill to pissy in 1 nanosecond   Like holy fuck  you need to make clarifications and walk on eggshells with fucking everyone   I don't see why people need to get worked up about meaningless things with strangers or people they actually know  It's like everyone acts like they demand to see a manager  I'm not perfect  but I'm not the problem if someone gets worked up over something simple because I didn't clarify that the green tea I'm drinking right now also has lemongrass in it  Ok i understand what you mean    i will try to do what you suggested  Thank you very much  You might try volunteering somewhere   like Habitat for Humanity or an animal shelter or something like that  I've been there  So many times  Just this week  actually  I was talking to my therapist about it today and there really is something to be said for throwing ourselves at breakneck speeds in work schedules so much that when we do get a day  or 7  that's unstructured  we go completely the other way and "waste" it   It's not a pleasant feeling  And I always wish I could at least have it back and use it to read or do something fun if I wasn't going to be otherwise productive anyway    But especially around the holidays and winter   It's not like sleeping is the antithesis of what our bodies need    Hang in there  Noone can say  Shrooms might give you 1 week's remission  or 3 months  Or they wont work at all  Or ketamine will do it  Only way to find out is to experiment  Thank you so much  I will try this tonight He is dead so hopefully not that good  There are some studies citing increased inflammation after exercise    https   www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles PMC3586919   https   www ncbi nlm nih gov pubmed 12690937  When I exercise too late in the day  I feel mentally obliterated until I fall asleep  Try switching the time of day you exercise and see if you feel any better  Them calling you a slut is their way of justifying their horrible treatment of you  You were indeed raped and should contact authorities asap  And for what it's worth you've got the support of us on this sub  I hope you get all the help you need   It has it's hits and misses  It's been on for a while so there is plenty of material to check out   Okay  I understand  If you feel that your life is better once you get life insurance  will you still go through with your plan  I'm on 60mg of Cymbalta and crying is difficult  I was at 120mg for awhile and crying was impossible for me  That being said  I think everyone's experience is different  Lots of variables   i don't know  I thought i had a heart attack on december 31st  but a friend of mine said he knows that feeling and he knows what a heart attack is because he had 2 yet with 31  and i told me that a heart attack don't come suddenly  Panic attacks are extreamly sudden    i don't have any idea how to get this through   i dont have the power to finish my apprenticeship and some other things  I know how you're feeling  I've been there  You should be upfront and ask if you've been putting too much pressure on her  or if something was different if you two could fix it  You should also consider that she may be going through something hard and totally unrelated to you right now  Ask her how she's been  Good luck  Hey really appreciate that  Trying to keep busy and aiming to build a bigger circle of friends  I find when I'm out and with people I'm okay so the aim is to make friends this year  Need to start going back to the gym too  I feel that would help haha  And don't worry  he is a cunt lmao I'm sorry for your loss  I can't even imagine how painful such a sudden death must be   Be patient with yourself in your mourning and healing  Treat yourself well   I'm sure your mother noticed your recent progress and she wants you to keep on that path as much as you can  Don't be afraid to ask for help  or space  or anything else you need right now  Call the police  Get help  Get tested for STDs  Tell your parents  You are not gross  ugly  fat or a slut and you are definitely not alone in this  We are here for you  Yep I've tried the whole human support thing  and this is working out a whole lot better      Horrible people did horrible things to you and they said horrible things  Go to the hospital  call the police  and don't listen to a word they said  Oh  one thing to ask about is if your doctor uses anesthetic when inserting  Some do and some don't  I've never had kids and it was pretty okay without the anesthetic  but some people faint and have a lower pain tolerance   I'm not confident I could teach language to other people but maybe something I could do like offering private lessons  Teaching english abroad has been on my mind and it's basically the only thing I can think of that seems like I could enjoy right now  I just need to take the steps to move and actually get the job I'm really glad it helped this has made my day so thank you  3    If you have any sons daughters they would be distraught to see you go as you would be a massive part of their lives  Your in my prayers  lt 3 Hi  Sorry to hear this  First  what my therapist said to me that when you have a panic attack you must try to breath deep and then normalize your breathing when you can  Also remember  panic attack is not going to kill you  It just feels like it and this is hard to remember at time cause it is so horrible when the panic strikes  You can also watch seconds running that can help you to calm down  sorry  I don't know how to say this better in english    Are you seeing any therapist  If not  you really should do it now  Healing progres is really slow but talking helps in long term  I hope you will feel better soon  You are not alone  Hey Patrick   First things first  you should go see your doctor  Could be your primary care provider  it doesn't need to be a therapist  But you definitely can be living a normal life  but not without helping yourself    Treatment doesn't always need to be through chemicals  Talk therapy is enough for many people    So  my advise is first thing in the morning before you go to work  pick up the phone and make an appointment   L2 I know exactly how you feel  I'm the same  maybe we can help each other  how about a chat  Wow my friend  that's a lot going on at such a challenging age already  I feel for you and wish you the best   It sounds like you already know how alcohol is a serious problem  I encourage you to take serious action as soon as possible on that  Addiction is no joke  and the longer it goes on  the more and more challenging of a monster it will become  It's a show of courage to be able to reach out and get help if that's what you need   If you have an impulse to get away for a time  I think this could be a very helpful impulse  It could allow you to gain perspective and get away from stresses that drive you to drink  That would be my hope for you  that it offers a change of pace that helps you start healthy actions  Be careful though that it's not escapism though  simple avoidance of your problems    Hope that helps a little  And I hope you can find support in your life too  whether professionals or friends and family  Best of luck  I understand  It can be very difficult to try to reach out to someone and talk  especially for those of us with depression  Do you have any friends that you talk to about your feelings   Im a sophomore they were seniors we went to school together I thought the same thing  but eh who cares if it's fake  It's better to just give advice for the situation and or move on with your life  It doesn't hurt anyone if they're making it up  and it could help someone in a similar situation who reads this  That's not dumb at all   That actually made me laugh too haha   All I can picture is my sister doing this  She used to accidentally start fires with the microwave all the damn time lmao   This feels like my life in a nutshell    I'm in love with someone whom I consider my best friend  I never told her because doing that can sometimes destroy the friendship in the process and I'd much rather keep her in my life for as long as possible    She recently told me she's pregnant and while there's a part of me that's happy for her  the rest of me feels as if I should slowly distant myself away from her  There lies the conflict  cause if I distance myself   She'll be gone  if I stay  she'll be here but not in the way I'd truly want her to be    I know it's selfish  But I'm lost   I'd thought I'd get over her but it feels impossible   Ayy  I wanna help too  lexapro will give similar feelings of numbness   i have no experience in taking it but i work in a pharmacy as a tech so theres that     Haha I can relate so much  I am always the initiator of any text  If I don't then it's just back to loneliness town   You didn't deserve this urgeless  My opinion of you is neutral however I don't enjoy your pain  I'm sorry  Oh and don't let  u Pizzachu1 drag you down because he wants everyone else to be as miserable as he is  As hopeless as he is  As utterly useless and unlikeable as he is   ayy 2's good but 3's better   If you take lamictal be careful because the Mirena IUD changes your estrogen levels which changes the way your body absorbs lamictal  I didn't know this and it caused a lot of problems  Please see a therapist  It won't be an instant cure but it will be taking a positive step for your future  I'm sure your friend cares but probably feels unable or over her head  Don't write off therapists  if you find a good one they can help  Yes  Cutting back on alcohol will most certainly help your depression  Alcohol is a depressant  Yes people can get tipsy and wild and have fun on it  but the stimulant itself is a depressant    I am a child of an alcoholic  Thankfully  I never became one  but I do enjoy the craft of alcohol beer mead etc  My friend and I run a YouTube channel about beer  no I won't give it to you  and last year we exchanged advent calendars  I did a video every day about the different beer I had received  Three weeks in  I had a suicidal attack  I did not want to wake up  Some how I KNEW it was the alcohol consumption  Though I enjoy the craft of it  I didn't partake a lot of it  Yes  I have been drunk many times  But I have never wanted or felt the appeal of having a drink every night  From then on  I am very cautious about drinking  I still do  but not in the slightest like I did last year   The best thing for you is to go to AA  One day at a time  AA helps so much  You even get coins for reaching different milestones  if you're a gamer it's like a reward   I'm not saying you have to go cold turkey but it is often the best way   Have you talked to adults or to the police  If not  do so now  You are not ugly or gross  These guys do NOT define your value  They are HORRIBLE people and they will get what they deserve  You need to go to the hospital  You need to tell your parents  I know your scared but rape IS NEVER the victims fault  EVER  Please please please understand you did not deserve this and it is not your fault  First just tell your parents a teacher sibling  anyone   Not entirely unrelated  where does one find access to gymnast type equipment like the hanging rings etc nowadays  Maybe just university athletic departments I'm thinking  I'm sorry that you feel so isolated  It must be really difficult to have such an unaccepting family   I can't really offer advice on improving your situation  I'm sorry that I can't offer much help   You can PM me if you want to talk about it  1   Please don't die  2   Call your parents  3   Stop with the Benzos   4   GET HELP   "We are not a crisis service  We can't guarantee an immediate response  and there are times when this subreddit is relatively quiet  This does not mean no one cares  If you need to talk to someone at once  you may want to take a look at our Hotline Numbers  https   www reddit com r SuicideWatch wiki hotlines" You ever tried joining a social therapy group  Or maybe join a meetup group that deals with some of your hobbies or interest  It seems like all you need is some positive exposure with people  You'll more than likely come to find you have a lot of common interest  especially since you have engineering expertise  I'm on Lexapro now   I don't feel much in the way of side effects aside from low libido  Good for you  It takes real strength to take that important step  Let us know how it goes with your doc  I called the suicide hotline 4 days ago after failing and I got to explain how I felt which was nice but she focused more on trying to convince me to avoid same sex relationships because "they happen too fast and always fail"    Funny thing is that my feelings had NOTHING to do with any of that     also told me to get rid of my dog  I got to vent to someone which was nice but I dont think Im ever going to do that again  They're honestly a little useless  I'm sorry that they treated you that way  Completely fucked   Hey  do you want to talk about it  You can PM me   Edit  Also  don't be sorry for making this post  It's understandable that you'd want to post somewhere about this and you don't deserve to feel any worse just for reaching out  Just seeing your response  so checking in     How are things now   Lots of young people have a hard time with this  Do you have a therapist  Are there any types of jobs that interest you  I'm at a all time low today  I have a lot of anxiety and depression about my bad oral hygiene  I hadn't taken care of my teeth because of my depression and I have depression because I haven't taken care of my teeth    I barely got out of bed today and have felt shitty all day  I lost the only person I could talk to about this stuff years ago to cancer  my dad    I'm not sure how to cope with all that or I just don't  I don't know  It's  definitely    absolutely     not your fault     Go to the hospital now to get a rape kit done  Really  go now    Please get help  You are worth so much more than these creeps  You really are  Hey buddy  I've been dealing with depression and quite bad anxiety for years too  There are a whole load of ways to deal with general anxiety  my go to is very relaxing music compilations on youtube  with an ad blocker   Music isn't great at calming me down  but if i make sure to keep it on  it helps to stop the prevent anxiety building to intolerable levels  I'd go on  but one piece of advice at a time  Give  this one  https   www youtube com watch v 5gfhv0iCfmw  a try  it's my favourite  2 years sober  It has being tough  and of course it did not magically solve my problems  I still deal with depression bipolar disorder  but if I had not stop drinking I would probably would not have a job  managed to leave the horrible neighborhood where I lived or finally have one semester left to graduate   Stop drinking  You can do it and it will help  If you cannot do it alone  don't feel bad  just look for help  Keep going  try your best and don't give up  I was excited for the holidays because I met someone in August and I thought  "hooray  I have a girlfriend to spend the holidays with" and you know what  She ruined Thanksgiving  broke up with me   Christmas  she was alone and blamed me because I had to spend the day with my family   and New Years  refused to spend the day with me because she was upset     To top it off  I've been dealing so much with her manic depressive tirades  that I've let my work decline and I may end up losing my job in April if I don't get my act together   Luckily  today she suggested we "take a break" and when I agreed  she blew up and told me to never contact her again  My life is teetering on the verge of total annihilation and all I wish is I'd been able to spend the holidays alone    So  I say good for you for being strong and getting through it  They're over for another year at least   Hey there  I'm not sure I have the answer for you but I wanted to comment because I feel like we have some things in common  I also dropped out in 10th grade as a result of some kind of situation at the time  and generally skipped school more often than I ever went  I remember feeling pretty bad  too  I spent the following couple of years doing nothing but playing World of Warcraft and watching anime   I also know how it feels to have art be my only income  and generally how it just isn't enough  Do you mind if I ask what kind of art you do  No reason not to go see it on your own  Watching movies isn't really a group activity anyway  since you just sit there looking at a screen and not talking for two hours  It's a great movie on the big screen  And it's good to try to do things by yourself to get more comfortable with it so it doesn't bother you so much     All of that is beside your underlying point though  wanting to go with friends and feeling lonely really sucks  I'm sorry    Ah  my bad  Yeah I completely agree with you  People like that are serious asses  Make that 4  3 My husband was adopted  and is non religious   and we live in a very conservative religious area  He pretty much found replacement family who would love him no matter what   and doesn't have a lot of contact with his family  Are there are resources for you to find a support group in your area  I don't know why   I'm just sad  For the most part I was successful at some things  I cooked twice and ate  I took a shower  Went to the store  Kind of cleaned  It's more than I usually do when I'm down  But all day I just feel the darkness coming around the edges  My chest hurts  Luckily the meds keep the worst away  But it will go away  I guess  Feel very down  I just feel lonely    My breakup made me realize I lost a chunk of friends  That they would rather hang out with a drug addict who mentally and emotionally abused me for a year and then basically left me broke  I went through this horribly difficult and painful and end the end violent break up with someone and didn't have anyone there on my side  I never got to mourn anything or was able to cry it out of be consoled      I'm sad because I'm lonely that I'm single  I haven't been alone in three years  Being me again is a priority but I just feel like a shell  I spent New Year's Eve with only a couple people I'm friends with and completely just couldn't do it  Headache  stomachache and then the social anxiety of being out which I haven't felt in so long    I hate that I went right into jumping into talking to a new guy  as if I don't trust myself to be alone anymore  But I feel like a fake  He likes someone who doesn't exist  I feel like I don't even exist   Late night solo movies can be awesome  Movie was great btw  I completely understand  brother  I wish I was a different person in a different universe  and I think of how happy I could be then  which always makes me smile in the real world  But after a minute or two  I come back to my senses and realise I'm smiling for no reason weirdly in public  Hey  I'm sorry you feel like your progress in life has stagnated   If you feel like you'd enjoy voice acting  I'd say that you should give it a shot  I understand that it's difficult to take a chance and risk failing  but if you're already thinking about suicide then I'd go for it  There isn't much harm in trying  right  And it might give you a purpose in life  because it's something you're really passionate about   By the way  that's a really cool occupation   I'm so sorry to hear that  Anyone who tells you to "man up" is an ignorant bigot undeserving of your attention   Are you receiving any psychological help at all  Maybe therapy  or if you're willing to give meds another shot  perhaps there's some that you haven't tried yet   Hold on  friend  I wouldn't think that's "normal" per se  but it happens  SSRI class drugs can sometimes trigger manic episodes in people who are bipolar and don't know it yet  have only had the depressive part   and mania isn't always feeling super duper happy  it can be dysphoric too  Or maybe Prozac just didn't agree with your particular brain  It would be worth talking about with your doc  especially if you are ever talking about trying a different medication  that kind of reaction would be important info  Taking curcumin with Bromelain improves its uptake   Greetings  Please don't let my name scare you  What's your new years resolution   My suggestion to you is to change your scenery  If you are in two dead end jobs why not just move  Google around for voice actors  who is your favorite by the way   and emulate them  Fake it until you make it is a real thing but you need to have someone to emulate  Voice acting is largely remote from what little I know so it could be done from where you are if you don't want to move  Also take up a physical hobby  The endorphins from exercise are very good for you and a great mood booster  Getting in shape will always make you attractive to people as well  Whatever you do be passionate about it and smile  People will gravitate to you as they always want to be happy as well  I wish you the best of luck in 2017 OP  I'm pulling for you    I'm glad to hear  Stay strong   D Do the parents know that she has these medically diagnosed conditions  Depressed people can be really good at hiding or minimizing these things and that leaves the parents not knowing the reasons for behavior  Nah  man  you don't deserve that  I know the feeling though  Hang in there   Yes  I'm in a NAMI support group because I have paranoid schizophrenia and was hospitalized in October  After that I moved in with my partner  and out of my parents house because I feel safer here  We live with another older gay couple and they've become like a second family to me  Now is forever  If you exist at all  then you've already existed forever  Mind derived time is temporary  Being is beyond mental constructs  Mind seeks meaning  mind seeks to find "a point to life"   This thought action is the mind going in circles  From the point of view of the mind it is pointless to search for a point  Yet of course that's not really true either  There is no meaning nor meaninglessness   If you need an ear  I can listen Finally the holiday season is over  I don't have to pretend that I am happy anymore  I think having a pet is  always  a great idea  but I hope you do get that dog at some point  even if not now  Mmm I don't know what to comment  Your feelings are very understandable if I was in your situation I don't think I could do better   This was two years ago  but I do believe I told her what happened  or my parents told her if I didn't   She prescribed me Seroquel  which was awful  but I never did receive a diagnosis and she didn't tell me why I reacted in that way  Awwww  Sounds like you have a grumpy one  I promise all the cats I've had have at least not hissed at me  Dogs are generally good tempered but cats get a bad reputation because of the ones that get real cranky I think you just discovered Existentialism    So go ahead and decide for yourself what life is about  Do you think people in an alternate world dream about being us  Sometimes it really is chemical  My psychiatrist has worked wonders  Ooh  yeah  seroquel is nasty stuff  S Hey bud  I've gone through something similar to that and the best thing to help me out was to just get out of my comfort zone  I know hanging out with people doesnt seem like something you want to do but take the time of isolation to figure out what makes them your friends  whether it be from childhood or not  Find the reason why they're apart of your life and think of that reason next time they ask you to hang out  You let them into your life for a reason and vice versa  They want to see you buddy  If you make it a habit of not seeing your friends then you might not want to see them once that feeling you have passes  I wish you the best  friend     Edit  comma Yeah that's a bummer  Things only get more awkward when you try to force yourself to talk either  I'm not trying to make light of your situation  but it's too bad they can't let you be the quiet friend like Silent Bob   I used to drink most nights and at one point  I was drinking a bottle of wine a night  I would stop for a while and I would feel marginally better  When I would drink  I would always wake up feeling despondent the following day  I didn't have that feeling when I stopped drinking  but I still felt "depressed " It's like gradations of grey scale  Physically  I was sleeping better and losing weight from not drinking extra calories  Emotionally  I felt only slightly better  nothing really to write home about   This past November  I bit the bullet and asked my doctor for help with my depression  I was at such a low ebb  I really wanted to shuffle off this mortal coil  but I have a kid and I can't do that to him  I stopped taking anti depressants almost two decades ago  because they only seemed to work briefly  I got tired of the side effects and messing around with different combinations doages  I have been white knuckling it since then and I think that's how I got into heavy drinking  It was taking the edge off of the depression in that moment  but the price was a rebounding  soul crushing depression in the morning   I am not telling you or suggesting you do this  I am just providing my experiences  I started taking this anti depressant and within 3 weeks my cravings for booze went away and I felt like life sucked a little less  I am feeling better  bit by bit  I don't dread getting up in the morning and I don't sit around in my pajamas until 4 PM anymore  I think because I am no longer severely depressed  I no longer need to seek relief through a glass or three of Pino Grigio   I do want to point out  I didn't take the anti depressant to quit drinking  it was from a desperate desire to stop feeling like shit  The reduction in booze cravings was a bonus  I was basically drinking to blunt the depression    From your post  I feel like you are in a similar place where I have been  I know it's a shitty place to be and shitty cycle to be trapped in  I hope you will explore this further with your therapist  because it's honestly no way to go through life  Take care   3 Damn  this describes the dynamic of every single friend group I've had  Unfortunately I don't have any friends now  so maybe I got too awkward and sad for anyone to want to be friends with me   They know  they just think its all a bunch of bs Hi there  sorry to hear that you have had such a bad sexual experience at such a young age  It sounded to me at first like you 3 got drunk together and one thing led to another  but their attitude afterward and particularly the rough treatment during the sex makes me think it was definitely something they may have planned    I know it's hard at the moment  but try to remember that they have called you those hateful things because they are either ashamed of themselves  as they should be  or are just wretched human beings  A visit to the police might not be a bad idea as others have suggested  as that will at the very least get those 2 on their radar in case this happens to anyone else    Regarding the slut thing  As a guy  33 now  I have always hated the term  and  particularly that it is directed mainly toward women  There is no such thing as a slut  Boys like sex  girls like sex  That's the end of it  They're just trying to make you internalise and feel bad in yourself so you may not point the finger at them   Finally   I would see a doctor about your injury  always a good idea  Don't be nervous or embarrassed about it   doctors see much worse  It will be good peace of mind that you are fine  rather than stressing and not knowing   The only way you could know if you have depression is to go to therapy  I encourage you to do It  I think you might have misinterpreted the situation  they might have just said what they were saying in a tone of voice that made it seem like they were angry even though they weren't  Same thing keeps happening to be with concerts  I'm the only one of my friends that enjoy jumping around in the mosh pits and screaming my lungs singing along with the band    It sucks being that guy  I would suggest working out a routine to when this happens again  I don't even ask them anymore with I have a concert  I go an hour before to get a good space and stack up with red bull and food for the line and a lighter just in case someone needs it  I don't smoke   I'm on Mirena and haven't had a period since getting it inserted  Could be the IUD or could be the AP I've been taking  My mood has had no change though  Same for me  People only interacted with the "real me" if they needed something out of me like good grade etc  Whenever I wanted someone to like me I always had to adapt this personality that I thought they might like  its so frustrating  As for suicide I am also kind of in the same situation as you are  I don't have any siblings but my parents always pressure me to succeeded to fulfill their dreams  they never care about what I want or what I have to say    You can PM me whenever you want  I don't mind  I am very new at Reddit so I am still getting used to its mechanics   Yes  I am angered at the fact that they took it so lightly in prescribing it  to someone so young  and without a diagnosis  Some of the greatest people in history had their vices  Some of those great people even dealt with mental illness   Issac Newton suffered from bipolar disorder and depression  so did Edgar Allen Poe   Yet  they became inspirations for generations to come   If anything  their mental hangups were what pushed them to become successful   Their problems only made them stronger  One day  you'll probably be an inspiration for people like us  Your appetite for success is contagious   because I want to be successful too  I've been rolling around in this existential muck for years now  I suppose this post of mine is a breakdown of what it meant to me   Life is still meaningless to me    29yr old female  ptsd   major depression  and anxiety paranoia  After trying almost every ssri out there they finally tried Lamictal at 100mg and its pretty good  but what really made me go up was adding 150mg of effexor xr  ssnri    5mg of Zyprexa and 2mg of prazosin  I  would be dead without my meds by now  The effexor killed my Sex drive at first but it's slowly coming back   The Zyprexa really helped with my paranoia with almost no side effects  The prazosin is what I call my miracle drug  it kills my nightmares so I can sleep restful for the most part   I started on a low dose of Lamictal  and when they raised it I got a horrible rash  apparently that can be either a deadly rash or a simple hive like reaction  it doesn't happen anymore thankfully but they say I'm at my max dose for it  The Mirena releases a very small amount of a progestin  and the majority of women who use it experience their usual hormone cycles after they've had it for a little while    Here's a detailed breakdown on how an IUD and other forms of birth control vary in terms of how they affect hormones    https   www bedsider org features 317 all about hormones I've known I was going to be a pathetic  friendless loser since I was a little kid  and I still can't get over it  You'd think I'd be used to the idea by now  that it wouldn't hurt so much when I saw happy young people out on dates or just hanging out with all their friends  but it's still devastating  If there's one thing I hate more than anything else about being human  it's the engrained need for contact with other humans  Obviously it's a wonderful thing for a lot of people  but it's a curse for people like me  like us  people who weren't socially conditioned in a healthy manner when they were kids   How is 'now' related to 'forever'   Pointless to search for a point because there is none objectively  therefore meaningless  I mean  if you take it to that extreme  I believe the term for that would be mania or hypomania   I agree though   A healthy human does not sit at the polar opposite of the spectrum in terms of depression  they're more in the middle  if that makes any sense      Holy shit man  you're a fucking wizard  What did you say when you did start talking to her  You must have been bricking it on that first date  I had a paraguard copper IUD for 4 years  If it's covered by insurance or inexpensive for some reason  I think it's worth trying since it can be extremely effective and worry free   I think sometimes our brains latch on to what we hear  so I'm hesitant to explain my negative experiences  But since you're asking  I think my body slowly  and then rapidly  rejected the IUD  My cramps were so intense I was asking friends for leftover opiates even though they make me kinda sick  I started getting BV which had never been an issue  and my resulting self consciousness ruined my sex drive  My OB Gyn said he'd had several patients start having problems after a year or two and decide to get it out    In the last few months before I had it removed it felt as if something was very  very wrong that I had trouble pinpointing    my anxiety was flying high all the time  about everything  and I had strong feelings of wanting "this thing" out of my body  I'm very much a skeptic and had zero qualms with the IUD going into it  I was so excited to get it  actually   but I became so physically and psychologically uncomfortable that I was scouring forum after forum on copper IUD's and found hundreds of women who had bad reactions similar to mine  You might say these were not reliable sources necessarily  but I felt so strongly something was very wrong and they matched up well to my experience  The only scientific study I found was one that found copper levels were too high in women after a year of use  But that was only one small study      then again who will fund further studies on the negative effects of such reliable birth control    I can dig it up if you're curious   Personally I think the recent craze over IUD's isn't representative of the many women whose bodies react poorly to them  I'm not saying don't try it   if costs are low  it's totally worth seeing if it works for you  But I personally wouldn't recommend someone drop  500  1000 on one  And if you're feeling uncomfortable  don't hesitate to remove it  I felt so much better once I did     Edit  I also went from 3 day walk in the park periods to 5 6 days of murder scenes  But that part was worth it to me  It was the pain  anxiety  malaise  and BV that pushed me to have it removed  Also important  my best friend LOVES paraguard and has no extra pain or other issues       Edit 2  just fyi I'm very sensitive to both pain and hormones   My best friend who loves paraguard is sensitive to hormones but not pain    Fuck   I appreciate you replying  I also spent most of my time after dropping out on the internet and watching anime   I'm an adult oriented artist digital artist  Mostly work through furaffinity  I really enjoy it but also its so hard when in between commissions and building a follower base   What about you      Ayy but that poem was nice  mister or miss   Just wanted to let you know that    If that's not rape then I don't know what is  Go to the police asap  Don't let them get away with this or they might do it someone else   Could you try writing it down and giving it to them  It's completely understandable that you fear rejection  this doesn't make you a loser   I guarantee that you aren't nearly as bad as you see yourself  You are more critical of yourself than anyone else  If you have some form of depression  your thoughts become even more irrational and you see yourself in ways that no one else does  Just remember your perception isn't clear  and it's causing you to see yourself as worse than you really are   I'm sorry for your pain   3 Where do you live  Sorry to be so personal  but here in Northern Europe 'cold and disinterested' is the norm and much more acceptable  than friendlier climates   Perhaps you'd do better with people more like yourself  I don't know where you're from  but I'm from Canada  I've known a lot of guys who have gotten into various professional hockey levels  and it's really not all it's supposed to be  They say once you're in it  it becomes a job just like any other  There's a lot of pressure and stress  Your job performance is always in question  and if you don't want to lose your slot  you have to be working constantly and sacrifice every other part of your life in order to make it work   If you really love sport  use it as your refuge   Everything else is shit  don't drag the complicated shit into the thing you love   As for what to do with the rest of your life  people in your and my age group are expected to change careers eight times in our lives  Not just jobs  but whole sectors of employment  The 40 year factory job doesn't exist anymore  there's only the hustle  When I was thinking about my future  I did an exercise  I just took a piece of paper and tried to figure out what I was good at  I have really terrible self esteem  so this was really hard for me  I eventually had to start asking people for help finding the good things about myself  Then I looked for interesting problems that matched my skill set  Maybe your friends and family  or someone else can help you with a similar exercise  And remember  you won't be stuck in a 40 year job ever  because they don't exist anymore  If you don't like a career  build knowledge on the side and move on  You're not chained to a wall or anything like that    don't ever try to impress anyone but yourself  I havent got a reccomendations for an app if you are looking for it  But i have my own reward systems  It involves popsicles for the smaller tasks like vacuuming and it involves lazy days for the days after my quarterly spring winter autumn summer cleaning   I just say "Good " I don't think it's inaccurate to say it's just a way of saying Hello that has the illusion of being friendlier or more informal  The expectation is that everyone involved says they are "Good " Do this all the time  I'm the complete opposite person of who I really am   Thank you for sharing your story  Someday we will all be okay   That sounds familiar  Was it in a book  I'm here if you want to talk  Send me a pm whenever you like  from your description it sounds like they had sex with you against your will  which is rape absolutely  I'm sorry that happened to you  nobody deserves that   Tell me what movie you are going to watch  I have no friends either lol  I'll go watch it too so it's like you have a friend with you     I don't mean to be rude  but it's very different for awkward girls  Most guys find that kind of behavior cute and it's not going to effect their opinion of you  On the other hand  awkward guys are absolutely not cute and are actually repulsive to the majority of females  Very awkward guys are basically fucked when it comes to romance   Haha  I do the same  I dunno  I just felt like it was likely we may be from the same part of the internet  How bout that  I wonder if we've even stumbled across each other before  To me  the holiday season is over  and it's time for me to pretend that I am happy again At least something makes you happy Fuck them    It's the attitude we need to change and accept that we should say fuck the rest of them  I'm not there yet but it's true  You're just as important as everyone that makes you feel bad  We're possibly the only intelligent life in the universe and we're only here for an insanely insignificant amount of time  I just wish some of us weren't cursed with stupid brains that make everything seem impossible   Bro  you are my spirit animal    Sorry   for   not   posting   something   helpful  Ehh  thats normal to a large degree for some folks  You have Reddit and it's 24 7    So how was your day  The thing with friends    I feel like it can get really easy to rely too much on them for emotional support solutions  They're just people too  you know  I also know that when someone is in an especially bad depressive episode  there is really no talking them out of it  That's   hard for our friends  too  Somewhere  there has to be a balance between things   I hope you can repair this important friendship  Remember you need to consider what they may be going through and what got them here  Eventually I run out of things to browse     Reddit is my getaway most of the time when I'm feeling down and alone My day was okay  I'm alive    how about yours   Sex drive went way down for the first year  Appetite through the roof for the first year  Both stabilized themselves for the most part  although I still suspect that both are out of whack still    Yeah I don't feel sad just tired and foggy  I'm kind of in the same boat  I'm 21 and I really just don't want a future anymore  I hate life and I would gladly end it  but I also don't want to put my family through that  Im kind of mad that I can't just end it  because living is unbearable anymore  but I don't want to pass the pain onto anyone else  it's tough  and I'm sorry I don't have any advice  but hang in there man   I love that I'm allergic to dogs and cats  I'd love to have a reptile or rats but I'm not allowed to have those either under my dad's rule  despite me even paying some rent   Suffering   hug  how are u doing  I feel like asides from being awkward  looks have a lot to do with it I'm not good looking  therefore many people don't really look to talk to me whatsoever  In turn  I just get more and more awkward with time   Keep trying  do you have a soundcloud  I make music too I want to hear your work Yeah  I hear you  The important thing for me was to take lots of long walks with a notepad  think  and then write down the things that were important to me  After I was diagnosed  I read a lot of philosophy  mostly the classics and mostly ethics   I got some nuggets that I keep  They're good to have on the good days  but my shitty days are still shit  Life without meaning is    meaningless  Maybe it's more precise to say purpose  I dunno  If you're into reading dense stuff  you could pick up some philosophy books  They can be surprisingly cheap  Dover Thrift Editions usually less than 5 bucks  I'd recommend Epicurus  Marcus Aurelius  and J S  Mill  but those are just what resonated with me  My concern   when she's on a regular schedule  primarily working  she does great   On days off   between jobs  she falls into sleeping all day and Netflix binging   Despite having lots of things she would like to work on  she's not motivated to start them on her own   And without sounding like I'm nagging her  I'm not sure how to encourage her to make use of the time she has available to accomplish her goals   However  what I also know is that the blows to her self esteem when she loses a job are crushing   And if she had disability  perhaps she'd be able to pursue volunteering in some of the creative fields she loves     Thanks for the input    The craziest thing is  in all the successful relationships i know  the guy cheated on the female but they still have way more successful of a relationship than i ever will  thanks    this helped a lot  Looks like I should to CBT first to build a foundation and then attempt DBT next  I feel you  I've been there  in my own way  I think the first step is to figure out why you're terrified of being vulnerable   I've had my own battles with pride and being unwilling to ask for help  or to receive it when offered  I thought long and hard about it  and ultimately I believe I'm just like this because I wasn't raised in an environment that was safe enough to be vulnerable in  So  it's just what immediately comes natural for me  Now that I know that  maybe I can make the steps to feel more comfortable about vulnerability  too  You should go to the hospital and tell them what happened  What someone else does to you is not your fault  Same  it really sucks being alone  If you want we can talk about it  Message me in pms if you want  Try to eat something healthy at least sometimes  I go too long without food too  and man  You just feel a difference  You won't get better if you don't eat   Hell  today I sat and thought that it would be too much work to make any food  Too expensive to order delivery  I'll just not eat today  But   I managed to toss some carrots and potatoes into boiling water and at least had that much  I'm glad that I did  Really  you only need to be good at meeting one stranger  It's got at least as much to do with luck as it does skill  So post here  Plenty of folks listening  It helps to vent sometimes  I like to drink ginger ale when I have an upset stomach  especially hangovers  The ginger helps  and the carbonation does  too  This sounds like rape  You need to see a doctor  congrats  small steps at a time will turn into bigger accomplishments  People make it seem so crazy that someone that went through the things that you have dont want to be vulnerable  Ever see a abused dog try to bite the crap out of someones hand thats trying to help  Hope seems lost  You have that coice in your head telling you that you can get through this  Listen to that  Listen to your heart  I feel that you keep going to bad relationships is because thats what seems normal to you  That sucks but you gotta see the other side of things  Busting your ass trying to see the light in the experiences you've been in is incredible  Keep doing that and im sure one day its going to pay off  You're not letting life kill you as much as it showed in the past it wants to  You're  a strong human being  Keep it up bud   Just because you took the time to respond to my post and listen to me  I just want to say that you helped me a lot  Something about you being a perfect stranger and all  is what I needed  hope you had a happy holidays and I'll pray you have a good 2017  posting this now because my family went to the airport today and i'm free from the danger of conflict Okay  If you're going to do that can you talk to me first   No problem man  sometimes you need to make light in a bad situation  im a complete utter disappointment and failure too  dont worry op  no ptsd or bpd though  just a plain loser https   soundcloud com hacker logic  Still learning the ropes  but I'm getting there  Dude  you're 23  You're not supposed to have life all figured out yet  Actually  flipping from interest to interest could turn out to be a good thing  figuring out what you like and don't like  All the grownups who seem like they have their shit together  Sham artists  the lot of them  There's no magical plateau of completeness where everything is fine and dandy  You're not behind  The only person you should ever compare is past you  Everyone has to move at their own pace  People like us just do it with heavy weights  Some people have the weights on for a bit  then they can take them off  Other people wear the weights for the whole damn marathon    Serious question   have you talked to your therapist about how the thoughts management feels bogus  I've had that same feeling about some of the therapists I've had  I've had stuff that's off and stuff that clicks  I do self compassion meditations and they feel pretty goofy but I still kinda like them i love love  i feel its one of the only things i have anymore that i know will give me some happiness I'm a bit confused  Are you trying to say something about inflammation  or are you trying to say something about acetylcholinesterase  You haven't established that there's any sort of relationship between the two with the research cited in your OP  No wizard here  Just learned to use the Internet as a shield  My issue is I suck at making conversation   If asked direct questions then I am fine   I guess I just went into it not expecting anything   You did it  Every little bit counts  Keep at it bud  I'll be your friend   You've been through way too much  And you're so young    you don't deserve any of it   I know you feel hurt and betrayed  and maybe you won't want to hear this  But you just can't put that much pressure on someone  "You said you didn't want to be my "lifeline"  you know what that means  You know what that means  That means you are okay with me dying  That means you are okay with me killing myself over the loss of the only person that held me together "  I believe you that she was  most likely  the most important thing in your life  I know that it feels like she has sentenced you to death  But to give someone that responsibility    to suggest that if someone doesn't stay with you that you will hurt yourself    it is a very malicious and manipulative thing to do  I'm not telling you this to make you hurt worse  and I don't think you're a bad person for feeling this way  I just don't want you to make a mistake by acting out of the passion of the momentwithout thinking about it with a more clear head  I don't know what happened  but this behavior will jeopardize any hope of potentially becoming friends again and I don't want that for you  I get headahces from resting my head all day  where you crying laying down  Also what did they told yoy   I just tried this out and it may make you feel better   Try masturbation  shampoo can work as lube   Go to the hospital they will give you a test to collect dna that may be left behind from the rapists and they can call the police for you  Even if you did it's doubtful many would care  And I don't mean to sound all doom and gloom but it's true  Most people are so wrapped up in their own problems for them to stop to help you would be a huge effort  You have to care about yourself enough to seek help from professionals  because I guarantee you no matter how much your friends and family love you they do not want to deal with this horrific condition that has a tendency to return  Depression is mental cancer   Yes they are  I'm going to chat with my psych about how I can manage it because unfortunately it is causing my old eating disorder to rear its ugly head  Its kind of comforting to know I'm not alone in these feelings its also upsetting knowing others feel similar  I'm sorry  No I haven't been laying down    Long story short I got let go from my job due to cost cuts  and my mother decided to throw it in my face today how much of a piece of shit I am  She said a lot of things that made me feel horrible including eating what she buys   it's not like I eat a lot of it  just when she cooks and stuff   Which isn't out of the ordinary for her    I'm a single mom  and it's already tough I get no child support  And I'm really trying my best  But it's never good enough and I'm breaking down  Ugh  Now I'm crying again   Based on your post description  you didn't set out looking for sex with someone  let alone everyone else  Please tell someone  That's really cool actually  I've been through a few accounts but I'm finally situated in one I plan on staying at  In all honesty I think it'd be cool to help support your art  It'd be crazy if we'd crossed paths before  thank you so much man  if you ever need somebody to talk to hit me up cause you restored my hope no  none of this is your fault  i'm so sorry you had to deal with this  please please please tell someone you know in real life  Guess who couldnt do it  Most people feel nervous and awkward when meeting other people    even if they don't act like it   So here's the thing we have to tell ourselves   "That other person   they feel awkward too  I'll just help them meet people by helping them meet me"    I'm usually happily surprised when I stop thinking of myself as the stranger and instead think of myself as a person who helps others feel more comfortable   You may find this hard to believe   I certainly did   But here's a fun fact    only 1 2 of 1  of people actually like going to a party or group where they don't already know someone   That's a tiny portion   Even though when you look around  you'd swear a large portion of people are extroverts   Well  a lot of people are extroverts  but it still doesn't make them feel less insecure or less awkward   they only act like they don't     They problably sad those things t intimidate you and make you Hide and feel guilty but its not your foult ok   They are trying t put the Blame on you BECAUSE they know they are horrible and just dont want to face it I had to reply to this  Once  not too long after moving into an apartment on my own for the first time  I left dishes in the sink for so long that a fly apparently laid eggs in one of my bowls  I found maggots  Lots of them  I threw that bowl out  I learned from living there that I will never be able to keep a sanitary kitchen without a dishwasher    hand washing dishes was one of the most monumental of tasks when I was severely depressed  ya that hits me really deep    I know what it feels like to feel the things you are  and I understand how tempting it is  But think of it this way  there are things about myself I dislike  and I have qualities I would rather not have  Now would be a good time to think about what you've done wrong in the past  and how to do otherwise in the future  If you don't like who you are  pinpoint what you think is the source of that and work to change it  Self improvement is impossible if you're dead  If you want to become the person you aspire to be  killing yourself would only make it impossible for you to do so  Just my two cents on the matter  I'd like to hear what you think  Hi there  6'3" and 33 years old here  I have suffered from self worth issues and depression since I was about 10  Apart from the daughter  we don't have kids  I could relate to a lot of your story  Seemingly good decisions I have made in the past   not realising how it would affect my future mostly due to things completely out of my control  I started concentrating so much on the past and thinking "if only I did this and that" and I just spiraled into a worse and deeper depression     I'm not sure if they will work for you   but these are the things that have helped me out     1  talk about  it  Either to your wife   or your local neighbourhood counsellor or a local support group  I'm not sure if this exists where you're from   but in Australia we have something called "mens shed"  There are heaps of them in each local area and they are designed to get men together to discuss issues that guys are always told not to because we just need to "man up" and not have feelings  They do hobby work   wood work and local neighbourhood projects     2  move forward  This is the hardest one for me  I get so stuck in a rut thinking about what I wanted to do that I forget that today is tomorrow's yesterday  I try to give myself realistic goals and aim for them   like getting myself back in shape etc   Having a schedule for my spare time has really helped     3  relax  Not the sort of relaxation I thought would help   i e   alcohol or computer games   but real relaxation  I have always been on the move and want to keep busy because I don't want to spend any time with my thoughts  so I find it very hard to relax  I have found a couple of apps that help  The one that had helped me the most  which is also free  is called "Depression CBT Self Help Guide" that I have in my smart phone  I cannot recommend this strongly enough     4  ask if your wife is okay  I'm sure you've done this one before   but if she is suffering depression also she may be feeling exactly the same as you  A couple with depression may seem loveless sometimes   but is more just an issue with internalising    5  get fit  Nothing is better for my mental health than psychical health  I used to be quite fit and 5 years of extremely stressful jobs  those life choices again    saw me get quite unfit  which is where I find myself at present  I have been regularly exercising again for a short while and am already feeling a lot better fit it  Perhaps you and your wife can go for walks or to the gym together  It would be a nice way to spend some stress free time together too    Anyway that's what helped me  I hope things work out well for you bud  both for yourself and your family   "Doomed" is a big  permanent sounding word  Meeting people is just a skill like any other    Improvement comes with practice  practice  practice  You're not doomed   I wouldn't want to hurt OP if everything they've said is true  Even if there was sufficient evidence  which I am not finding  it's not worth the risk to me  its whatever man  good luck  I will too   i dont even know what to say  this story is crazy  its crazy that youre still with us  youre amazing Aww I'm sorry to remind you of that  Well I would suggest some sort of excercise to get move some of the blood from your head  Running is good walking too any excercise really   It's the toughest moments that require the strongest faith  I'd like to remind you that you had strong motivations before and some things to work toward  Right now it's not going to be easy and there might not be anything that could change that  To me that's what faith is  working toward something you don't believe exists right now  Your mom is a good reason to do so  Of course you'll always have at least a little support with the great people here  too  Love you If you doubt a post is on the up and up  please bring it up to the mod team and we will take a look  It is completely inappropriate to accuse an OP of lying in this manner  Then you haven't read enough  You are still having the crisis because you haven't understood  even science is the meaning  You just haven't gotten there yet   Read more  educate yourself  I was in your situation too for a long time  You also have no idea how the universe ends  you didn't even get the theory right and the theory is outdated  most cosmologists believe the universe will expand forever  and based on our most recent looks at dark matter and the expansions of the universe  it likely will    Just educate yourself  You will sit back and laugh that you ever thought you had anything figured out  because our insignificance and our lack of knowing is the only thing we truly know  I don't really have a solution  I used to just have hypersomnia  Now I have both hypersomnia and occasional insomnia  It's a really big pain in the ass  I tried doing sleep hypnosis videos on YouTube  I think that helps a bit  Dealing with headphone cords and such is a hassle though  I should be sleeping now       Edit  I have will say this though  my personal anecdote is that I've tried doing a "reset" before by just staying awake for 36 hours a couple of times  It's never really worked out  I've been taking the supplements for depression and inflammation reduction  Inflammation has been linked to depression  Coincidentally  the supplements also seem to have some degree of acetylcholinerase inhibition  which could explain why they initially help with my mood but in the long run my mood becomes worse  Well I imagine a lot of people here are royalty This  Get help  my friend  Take care of yourself first  Everything else can wait  I didn't have much guidance growing up and still don't have any type of mentor in my life  My parents are complete turds of people to say the least and I have pretty much been in control of my own future since adolescence   Sometimes I feel as if I have no direction in life as a result of this and it can be frustrating that I don't have that structure   But what gives me peace of mind is knowing that I AM taking the necessary steps to get where I need to be in life   Life is hard  Good luck  Nearly  of humanity lives on less than  2 50 a day  If you live in an advanced country  even a poor existence is far better than the average Thank you  that's very kind  I definitely will    And you feel awful for complaining because people don't understand that you can't tell your mind to stop hating you        Exactly   I'm at my lowest on the "fun" days where I'm out with friends  Makes no sense but that's life  Well  my life at least  When I first got my Mirena put in  it did affect my mood quite a bit  but over time it levelled out  I get really down a day or two before my period  and this still happens with the iud  Also  please remember that iuds are still not 100  effective  I'm also on a birth control pill on top of mine   20  no positive qualities either  going for the long haul Around a year and a half ago when driving a car or when alone at home I would occasionally really scream  Since then the classic Edvard Munch painting 'The Scream' has become a favorite  I do it much much less now  Looking back I'd say screaming like that helped me to express and understand some complicated emotions  Really  just keep swimming  let yourself scream sometimes  and make a little progress  They held you down while they penetrated you  The fact that they held you down is a clear indicator that you did not consent  This is apart from the fact that as a minor you cannot legally give consent  These two facts make literally everything else about this irrelevant    They've told you you're gross and a slut to make you believe that it's your fault and to break down your self esteem so you don't tell anyone  Posting this is a huge step in the right direction but you need to go to the police  I can't imagine how difficult that must feel  but it is the only way that these guys will get the punishment they deserve  They took advantage of you and everything that happened only reflects on them  and what despicable human beings they are  It does not reflect on you whatsoever  no matter what they said   Please tell the police  Please get help   Yeah  it's hard to make friends    hey  no problem though  I'm glad it meant something  And I hope things start improving for you     Stronger together Life insurance won't make my life better  just my death more worthwhile   BUT HEY   I took some stimulants and right now I feel pretty good   I definitely want to live  even though I am rather concerned about succeeding and being able to manage day to day   I still want to take out life insurance because it's almost certainly going to return   Who knows what I'll feel like then    Hint  I DO   That's why I'm taking precautions    Stimulants usually help  whether it be a Monster or ADHD meds   I feel like I feel like I'm meant to feel  Abby   I worry that the effects wear off with use  so I try to keep it low   Lately it's been helping me cope during this swing   It's likely I'm somehow chemically imbalanced   Maybe one day I'll get the testing and treatment I need   Oddly  in these states I can make many of the same observations and conclusions with only 10 ish of the negative effect   I still feel a bit sad when I think about it  but I can think much more objectively and brush it off   For instance  I know I'm probably a somewhat fragmented or emotionally damaged individual  and that I may not deserve any romantic interests I would accept  and I know that tomorrow could be hellish  but I don't have to obsess and I don't have to spiral down   I'm okay    If you want to get off meds you should seriously talk to your doctor   More than most can do  myself included     Keep up the good work  Thank you    I wish I was   Part of me wishes she would read this   Part of me just needed to get it out   I don't know what to do going forward    I tried so hard   Giving everything I had   I wish it mattered  I cant even do one correctly honestly  good for you  D Always do this  i usually imagine myself as a completely different person   What about a hedgehog  The only allergies from them can be from their bedding  My hedgie is my ESA  helped me through a lot   There are hypo allergenic dogs as well  poodle mixes are great  My cavapoo was my frist dog that was 100  mine  He doesnt shed and has also always been there for me   Don't know compassion pit but my best guess is it's like blahtherapy or 7cups  check those   I know this is a scretch  I will tell you this from my own perspective though   Could it be that you are smilling because issue that is tormenting your life is adressed in some form  Your mind probably wants to tell some one but you probably keep it inside you   Most people don't discuss things like these with people who have these thoughts as they believe it is not good for them  but this stuff when it is discussed can help  It is adressing the problem  most people ignore this as it is too dark and uncomfortable to discuss and falsely believe that it will perhaps make you act upon your dangerous thoughts  Wooooooaw this isn't your fault at all and this is absolutely not ok  They got you drunk and physically held you    how can you even consider it is your fault    these peoples are bastards  Go to the hospital  please  I literally have this same thing and I always thought I was crazy   I hate when nobody responds to my texts  and yet even when we talk I'm antsy  It's so odd  I don't know what it is but my guess is it's anxiety paired with low self esteem  needing validation  paired with a desire to get your mind off the negative  At least for me that's what I think it is    What job do you do     let's talk unfortunately it really doesnt matter since my father has the last word  cannot wait to move out  whenever that is My roommate has left them out that long multiple times  It got so bad that we just switched to paper plates and plastic utensils  i think it was cool of you to get it all out  i dont think the journey can end here though If you need to talk  pm me or reply here      if you would like    I'd love to listen This is exactly how I feel  And the worst part is when she randomly texted me saying she doesn't want me in her life anymore and that she was only my friend cuz she felt sorry for me  Sigh   I get you  I've pretty much given up on art now  My inability to do good just makes me so angry and hate  art  especially myself  So now I avoid getting motivated and start drawing cuz I know I'm gna give up and get hurt at the end   Please  i know this is late but please go look for some kind of help  If you can PM me man  just need to know youre okay The constant hurt that must be endured is the worst of all    it makes time feel slow  For  me at least     At the same time    I think things can get better  In degrees    but even that takes time  Like baby steps from what about Bob   yeah  giving up and getting hard is all too associated with drawing  just feeding into my already breeding negativity  considering just deleting my tumblr so i can walk away I mean  I can't draw a straight line so you can't be this bad at drawing  Drawing seems like a really fun skill to learn  and I hope you end up finding your own art style  whatever it may be  i can get like 50 on a good day  and even thats not that much  p   like a lot of others i was in the same place you were  where i couldnt even do like 7  just keep at it and youll get better  lifting weights also makes pushups wayyyyy easier  went from less than 35 to 50 in literally 1 day after i lifted weights for like a half hour  p   im not sure how it works but it worked for me so if you want you can try it and see if it helps    i dont like arms tho  i like to run more tbh  keeps me     not fat i guess xD   good job tho man keep it up I think it's really brave of you to share your story  I have been through quite a bit these last few years and have had depression since middle school  however I've always been able to control it until recently  Thank you so much for opening up and for the advice  I'll try to find a way to motivate myself to start doing some of these things   Also I do watch league streams play it myself  League is life  Even playing in local tournaments soon  Feel like I could've written this  I have a terrible relationship with my father too and just having him anywhere near me makes me want to die  Spent the holidays getting drunk alone in my room    Love your username btw  Wish I was a cat too  Thank you that helps  Just walking around make my head feel a little better  This could have been written by me  minus the part about having your own place to live  Everybody makes mistakes  There's so few right ways to deal with our types of problems   they always say like "tell somebody if you're feeling down desperate suicidal" but society is not exactly able to help you with that stuff   it just ends up alienating you even more  Spilling your guts wouldn't necessarily have resulted in keeping all your relationships perfectly intact  That stuff is hard for normal people to deal with    First of all you need to understand that there are reasons for all the things you said and did   not good reasons  but reasons  You must have felt confused  scared  lonely  anxious  dejected  the list goes on  So it's not like you made those poor choices on purpose  or while in your right mind   The second thing to keep in mind is that you can't control the past  You can only look forward  with the knowledge of your mistakes    Whether that means making up with some of your friends  or finding new ones  it doesn't really matter  Take what you've learned and adjust yourself accordingly  Every day is different  i dont think im bad  but i think im painfully mediocre  everything i do is worth a good scroll while on your way to better  more pleasant art  im the filler space   thanks though  I don't have any children  I'm a lot like  George Bell  http   www nytimes com 2015 10 18 nyregion dying alone in new york city html  except not a hoarder   No pets   No wife   No girlfriend   No children   No purpose  though I'm trying to find one      Thanks  again   I do appreciate you reaching out  You too Please tell your parents and go to the police   This is not your fault  what those guys did is disgusting  I know you are scared and embarrassed right now  but you need to go to the police and report these sick fucks  or they're just gonna do it to other girls  You are underage  so this is probably in the realm of child molestation  That's super serious  and these fuckers could go away for a long time  but only if reported for their crimes      I haven't eaten anything in days   Do you not have much available  You need to eat  You will feel better  This is basic  Maslow's  https   en wikipedia org wiki Maslow's hierarchy of needs  hierarchy of needs   I was in a similar position  but it doesn't have to be socially taxing  expensive  or otherwise difficult  Try  Soylent   https   en wikipedia org wiki Soylent   food    It's one click away on Amazon  Just eat  something   You won't have the energy to get better without it  I intend on just killing my self I give up I can't take 23 years of hell anymore  I give up I can't take 23 years of hell and selfishness anymore  If you feel like it was the right decision  then it was    It may feel like he fixed you  but you got to be careful with that line of thinking  If he was controlling  like you said  it's likely manipulation  Manipulative people  abuse you  tear you down and make you feel worthless  Then they make you feel better  it tricks you into thinking they're doing good for you  it makes you think they're solving your problems when really they are creating artificial problems for you    It takes an incredible amount of will power to see manipulation and break free from it  I feel like things can get better but it won't ever be fixed  can I see anything you've drawn  Did you ever have nausea associated with anxiety attacks before in other situations  When does the anxiety come on and which happens first  What triggers anxiety for you in other situations   I had a problem with not being generally hydrated enough so I would drink too much water during my workouts and get nauseous   Have you been consistently drinking pre workouts or anything of that sort that could cause it  Supplements  Vitamins  Medications  Anything your taking in other than food that may be the culprit     I don't actually expect you to answer any of that but if something else sticks out let us know  As an atheist i dont believe there is a set point to live  I think we pave our own journey  achievements  and goals in life  We make our life what we want it to be   For me  this is my way of kinda coping with shit  Makes it easier for me to say "i can change this"  i promised myself that if i made this thread that i wouldnt post any art because i dont want pity points or anything    trust me  its just painfully mediocre  not bad  not good at all Agreed  I'm a very introverted  reserved person  and I always imagined myself as the one who'd always be alone  I've always been very lacking socially speaking  and I still am now for the most part  Lately  though  I've been trying as hard as I can to improve my ability to talk to people  I've just been  doing it   whether or not I want to  I'm still super awkward  but I think I'm getting better  the more I do it  You learn what works and what doesn't  and it gets easier  You're right when you say it's a skill  a skill that  when you become more adept at  makes it easier to get through that initial awkward ness  and actually  connect  with people  That said  I'm still bad at it  Practice  practice  practice   I feel the same way man  We just do things that distract us  I guess thats why some people are so into music  gaming  writing  etc  It just helps us cope with shit If you ever wanna talk man  just Pm me  Ill be there    I'm just going to end it I'm tired trying  I was at a career fair talking to Bayer and I thought it was going fine  but then one of the recruiters suddenly said "Don't worry its just as awkward for us " Like wtf I didn't think I was being awkward but okay lady  thanks for letting me know  Sometimes I just need to vent    And hearing other peoples stories  makes me feel less alone in my fight and allows me to gain alternate views with which to view my life from  Honestly fear is the biggest answer  I tried coming out to my bi uncle  who was in the closet at the time  and he told my mom  My mom told my dad and it was a whole big mess  My mom pretends it didn't happen and often asks me questions like when am I gonna find a gf  Or on the rare occasion I go out she'd say something like "You look good  what would you do if a girl asked you out"  It's weird because she accepted him but not me and says that she just doesn't want any of her kids to be gay because it's embarrassing  And getting out on my own is the most terrifying thing to me rn because I don't know if I can sustain myself at this age  I also don't wanna lose the few  3  friends that I do have no matter how good of friends they are  like I said  being completely alone terrifies me and is my real problem  and I don't wanna be made to feel disgusting about myself by being bombarded with sexual insult like the first and only time I tried to come out  But thank you for listening and trying to help  Those fictional characters  with almost any logic  would envy you  too  These stories start with a problem and end with a resolution  If you're posting on this subreddit though  the cataclyst already happened  Every book has a resolution  make sure they would envy yours  i dont know how to relate  why are you disgusted by people  Shitty honestly  like everyday tbh  Could care less though  kind of in that state where im just kinda numb to the feeling Congratulations  Today I can't get off the couch  I've just found out my gorgeous little cat  she's 11 and one of my best friends  doesn't have much longer  she has cancer and her liver is disintegrating   So I applaud you  Don't let the depression keep you down  We may lose a battle or two every day  but one day we'll win the way   my girlfriend struggled with depression for a good many years and it was absolutely horrible for her  but therapy helped her come a long way and she's doing way better now these days   i may be in the middle of it and you might be too  but know that there is a goal somewhere out there I can relate 100 percent  At the moment it is 1am and I am wide awake  I've tried all my meds and nothing seems to be helping  I am a manager of a large medical facility and had an altercation with a male staff today when no one was around  The male staff verbally abused me  however  as someone with BP2 my reaction was not the greatest and I lost my cool for about 1 minute before regaining control of the situation  The staff member is extremely manipulative and actually isn't one of my staff  but rather a member of another medical facility under the same name  we share staff   This situation would be tough for anyone  but as I am new and still learning to deal with being bipolar and my diagnosis I am feeling extremely guilty and worried about returning to work tomorrow  Mega props to you for reaching out and inviting him to stuff  Even though he didn't show  I'm sure it meant a lot  I don't know how familiar you are with depression   related problems  but it's real hard to even do things that we want to do    or basic things like showering      Personally I don't think there's anything wrong with confronting him about the post  especially if you found it because you were interested in his music   personality like you described  but you'd know better than any of us   It's hard to help people like us because sometimes we feel like we don't want help  or are broken beyond any improvement  The only person that can  really  help him is himself  Depression makes you so cripplingly passive apathetic that it's really difficult though   Seems like you guys are on the right track  Keep hitting him up every once in a while and inviting him out even if he still doesn't show  Make sure he is aware of any counseling services your school might offer  All of his problems sound temporary and circumstantial so hopefully it's nothing he can't beat  What is fixed     if a wall has a crack  and you tear it down to build another  is it fixed    But the mind isn't a wall  It's more like a tree  As we grow older  so does it  And wounds were once it wept from will become scars    and although the scars remind us  they don't make the tree weak   Have you got any examples of your work  I'm sure you're better than 90  of people heh  I have never had a sex drive  see my other response  im sorry  please trust my mediocrity and inability Fixed as in no more depression   I feel like that's just a healthy way of thinking about it but ultimately things still won't get completely better  Thanks though I don't even know what my goal is to be honest  Send me a PM with work  Can you draw animal skeletons  I'm looking for people to design tats for me  I used to draw a lot when I was younger I was good  now I fucking suck  Hey  it's incredibly thoughtful that you're putting this kind of effort into helping your friend  I doubt talking to anyone in his college block would do a lot  to be honest  he likely doesn't talk to them any more than anyone else  Telling him about see by the post would be alright  so long as he knows that you know his Reddit account  It might help some  so he knows what y'all already know about his situation    Again  you really are a special kind of friend  and I hope you're able to help your friend  Please update if it goes well  we love a story with a happy ending for one of us   Well  it's like  I don't want relationships like them  I want the relationships that they have  Or    maybe i'd just rather be with them  They won't envy me  I'm almost 18  barely hanging on to life by a thread  unwillingly   don't have a drivers liscense  haven't applied for college  don't have a job  and would honestly rather take my own life then grow up and become an adult  I am so sorry to hear this  so truly sorry for your loss  My moms passing a few years ago was very much like this  very unexpected  She was 59  my dad had gone to pick her up from dialysis  and i was over cooking them dinner  I realized they'd been gone too long  called my dad  who didn't want to worry us so he just told us her blood pressure wasn't coming up  a common complication after dialysis  But a few minutes later my sister pulled into the driveway and said we'd better head up to the hospital  She was unconscious by the time we arrived  her heart only coming back briefly  They did all they could but she was gone    I had a lot of guilt about what stress she may have been under  I was just out of state with my husband not two days before  where we decided to divorce  and I was moving in with my girlfriend   I wasn't cheating  I want that to be clear  though I don't wish to explain the situation   She was very worried about me  I know  and I have this fear that it was my fault  I know she was happy for me as well  but stress seems to do more damage than than happiness will ever do good  I was so ashamed of myself and afraid that her concern for me was a huge factor here   I only go into this so you know where I'm coming from  I hope it's alright to share these details  This pain  this sense of unreality and disbelief  there are no words to describe how it feels  But I want to say please don't linger on this guilt if you can help it  You can go over every angle  every moment you could have done something differently  But that is futile  Those are details  In the end  I'm sure she knew that you loved her  and I'm sure you know she loved you  No matter what was in the past  no matter what you did or didn't say  you did the best you could for each other and that is all we can ever ask of each other  You may have days of regretting the way you behaved toward her  then have days when you are bitter about how she acted toward you  But the details will never take away how much you loved each other  Let these doubts pass  When you feel the guilt and pain  focus on the feeling of love  That is what matters   I wish I had better advice  but it's a personal journey to get through this and no matter how well anyone wishes us we must bear it ourselves  It's terribly hard  Be kind and patient to yourself and your family  Don't be afraid or ashamed of your feelings  face them and work through them  Please don't blame yourself  you didn't do anything wrong    I know I'm just a random stranger  but I honestly do wish you my condolences and sympathy  If it helps  and you want someone to talk to  feel free to pm me  Above all  take care of yourself    I'd be happy to make a new friend     I'm currently in a voluntary psych ward and hope to meet and talk to some good professionals tomorrow who will help get me back on track too   message me please    I challenge you to go to things you want to go to by yourself  I used to feel identically to the way you do  All of my friends got really into weed  did nothing else   So what i did was just started going on my own  and I tell you what  it's actually a way better experience  In my opinion   If you want to take a break and eat something  you do just that  if you're having a good time and want to keep going  no problem  If you're having a bad time an want to leave  done  I'll admit  it feels weird sometimes  but even if it's not for you  going to stuff like that alone is probably the simplest way to find people who will go with you next time  i m really sorry   hope you can process grief in a healthy way  my father died few years ago and i still havent processed tht   It's not your fault  You did nothing wrong  Your brain just decided on it own that it was going to be sad  You have no control over this choice you brain made  You and your brain a different not literally but metaphorically  Yeah  rapists say that sort of thing  I don't need some one to jsjt say they care I need somebody who actually does care about how I feel and my situation I appreciate it if you do and or either way but I really can't take it anymore  You were raped  This is pretty clear cut  Totally agree about the physical exercise being amazing for mental health too   I'm a big cyclist and skier and I love hiking and camping too   When I'm going fast   pushing myself to the limit to chase some cool guy I see also pushing it to the limit I'm like so happy   i honestly race people just hoping to make a stranger into a friend   It's like how I interact with the outer world now that I'm so enmeshed in my own inner world   Trying to break out of just living a life internal is hard though A suicide is usually not the way out  and that's the thought of neurotypical people  however people like us with severe anxiety or depression   do not agree with that thought  Yes you might see it as selfish  however I would trust them saying it's not a good idea as  no offence  their brain functions better than someone who is mentally ill   Good luck  Let me know if you need anything at all in deciding anything  I think both are super helpful for different reasons but I'd start with CBT first   3  Your welcome    Even better  skype screenshare some netflix  I really want a dog  im also allergic to dogs and cats  even some hypoallergic ones  one of my class mates has a long haired chiwawa thzt im not allergic to and ive fallen in love with it  unfortuntly schools over so i dont get to see it anymore  really want my own one  i think its one of my life goals That is terrible and I understand how you must be feeling right now as I myself have just gotten home after watching my grandmother pass away  She was diagnosed with terminal cancer about 6 months ago so the blessing in disguise was that we had some time to time to make some final memories  Unfortunately I still feel like I never got to truely say good bye  My grandmother loved living and despite my grandfathers constant reminder of their age and the meaning behind that fact  she never would let on about her mortality right up to the end  In fact just last night I was sitting next to her joking and laughing with her  New years eve we talked about my plans and made me promise not to get in a car  However  I never was able to have the talk and let her know my deepest feelings of how much she meant to me and how devastated I will be without her in my life any longer  I feel she didnt want me to worry about her dieing so in her own way she thought she was protecting me by not letting on what was happening to her  However  we were both very aware of the ultimate outcome of her diagnosis     Today I woke up to a phone call from my mother crying telling me that my grandmother has lost consciousness and will likely be gone by the end of the day  Of course I knew this day was coming  but oddly  you always feel it'll be next year  month  week not today  You never fully accept that this person you care for so much will no longer exist until you know longer have the choice  hell it still doesn't feel real as I sit here typing this  When I arrived at her house she was lying in her bed with my family around her unconscious forcefully breathing  I gave her a kiss told her everything I wish that I had said the night prior to ears that could no longer hear and watched her stop breathing an hour later  My grandmother lost 60 pounds in three months  watching her waste away to nothing and seeing her lay in that bed and watch the life slip out of her was one of the hardest moments of my life      Nothing anyone can say will make this easier on you as I know it will be the same for me  I just hope you can find some comfort in me sharing my story as I found some in yours knowing that there are others out there dealing with the same crushing emotions that you are  I am so sorry how sudden this was and imagine that adds an extra twist to the dagger in your heart  What helps though is that there are many things known between two people that share love for each other that do not need to be said  Your mother knows how much she loved you and you loved her just as you do towards her  The last thing your mother and my grandmother would want is for us to be heartbroken simply because the words "goodbye" did not come out of our mouths  The emotions that we shared for our loved ones go much deeper then that making that verbal word all but irrelavant    We have some rough days ahead of us but please take care  if you ever need someone to talk to feel free to message me   Call for help  Please  There's still a lot to do  and you need to be there  Hope you're okay   3 Me too  although sometimes he's a unwilling companion  whenever I hug the guy my days are a little less gloomier  IMO the best thing for panic attacks is meditation   If you don't know how to do that then just breathe very deeply and slowly  Wait a couple seconds between inhalations exhalations  Try to only focus on things you can physically feel right now   like  the weight of yourself sitting in your chair  the way your clothes feel  the weird fluids and tensions running through your body  Try to clear out any lingering thoughts on intangible things   don't worry about anything except this exact moment  Allow yourself to slow down   If you can figure out how to defuse a panic attack then hopefully you'll manage until you can get into another session  I'm pretty familiar with depression ever since my parents split up  and I know what he's going through with his college friends since a similar situation happened to me some time ago      The difference is I had a really stellar group of friends to help me  no matter what  so it breaks my heart to hear that he feels like he has no one to talk to  I find its good to write stuff down when im emotional   I'm about to graduate soon  had an internship where I worked hard and was well received  but i hated it and everyone there  Idk  I feel very lost   Which streams do you like to watch  I have been recently enjoying bekuhs streams lately since I'm overseas and it fits my sleeping pattern she is an awesome grill   I play in oce  I would assume that you play in NA  I am ranked platinum haha   my whole life to get that rank lol  Are you a support main  Kappa   That's so radd your playing in a tournament      You  Go Grill    A trick I found that had worked wonders for me  do a little chore every time there's a commercial on when I'm watching a show  Commercial  Start a load of laundry  Empty the dishwasher  Set out the trash  Pick up the bedroom  Wipe down the kitchen counter  Sweep the bathroom  Little things like that  one or two at a time depending on how long the commercials are  Simple  little chores that over the course of one show can add up to a picked up and often cleaned up home   This is going to be me pretty soon  Because of the holidays  work has been pretty slow  but oh man starting this week onward  its gonna get crazy  I'm gonna get yelled at  looked down upon and just be absolutely broken   at which point ill probably have a panic attack  i mean I almost had one when it wasn't busy at my job  I hope you make it through this  OP I'm so sorry    my truck is my baby and my life  I don't know what I would do if I lost it  I often fantasize about driving into a wall or traffic but never in my own truck  I'll kill myself long before I hurt my truck  What kind of car  That's exactly how I feel I want to stay positive and do better but low self esteem and social anxiety simply kill it for me But then you realize that it will probably never happen  as is the reality for most people   After I read your post  I thought to myself that I wanted to reassure you about all the people you still have to meet in your life yet   And that I wish for you to not let just 2 people in your life to ruin your life   But then I immediately remembered how I was in a sort of similar situation like half a year ago  Shit was so real they committed me to the hospital against my will    So  I just want you to know that I know exactly how that betrayal feels  Like you wish you could be angry but all you feel is hurt and that sucks because there is no power in feeling hurt   If this help at all  its been about half a year since then and I mean of course things are super different  but i've moved on   Its so fucking disappointing when people aren't what you thought they'd be  Yes   I'm done meeting people   I've always been a big introvert  so my only course of action is really to isolate myself further until the loneliness and suicidal urges take over  but that's a ways off   Plus  this whole situation has caused me to think thrice about letting anyone in  period   That makes me cringe  Thank you    I'm actually an ad main with mid as my secondary role  I love watching C9 Sneaky and yes I play on NA  I haven't played much ranked though so idk what my rank is  Planning on playing more ranked this season  I just played hundreds of norms last season xD Preparing for the tournament is actually pretty fun though  Judging from you he does have a super group of freinds so hopefully he can see that  i would think asking him about it could be good  i know i would have liked it if someone from my group of "freinds" had seen one of my posts on here and asked me about it  shows that they care  i would believe that if you do ask him about it hes likey to enjoy that  probably would be a little bit awkward to start but once he knows you care and want to understand i imagine he will be pretty happy with it I don't have any friends  I drifted away from them  They all have lots of friends and I don't really matter  I don't think I will ever have friends again  I'm too shy to make new friends  I wish I had friends too   To put it very simply  CBT is how you think about things  and DBT is controlling your emotions  For bipolar  it seems CBT is more useful  It definitely was for me  and I have recently looked into DBT and it seems to have a huge foundation built from CBT  Look up the 10 cognitive distortions and really study and apply them  They improved my life tremendously    DBT seems to be mostly for people with BPD  but of course it can be applied to any disorder  I don't find much of a use for it  One thought  and depends on if you have time  is to help donate time volunteer at a local shelter aspca  you may not be able to take the animals home  but will allow you to get some time with a dog cat    Thank you  This post was very validating  I rarely feel that anyone gets the depths of despair I felt this year unless I really explain it and I'm not interested in reliving the rape especially  I will have to read more on this theory concerning Freud  I never thought of it from that point of view  I've been thinking the exact opposite actually  Assuming since I've been victimized and know the feeling I should be the last one to want anyone else to suffer  Like I said  your understanding of what may be going on feels more plausible to me  The only time I've considered trying to go back to the old me  idealistic  hopeful  constantly let down and insulted  is when my children are around me when I consider acting out  Up to this point I've raised them with my previous beliefs and they are very kind  considerate  thoughtful children  I do not want my children indulging in risky behaviors  as I do  However I know from experience  society does not appreciate kindness and compassion the way I used to  I want my children to know no one ever has the right to exploit  bully  manipulate or mistreat them in any way  I simply didn't fathom this as a child  A little sociopathy goes along way in today's day and age          I hate sitting here alone all the time  I feel like I'm wasting my youth away  I'm supposed to be close to people right  Doing things  Having adventures  Every time I try to reach out I feel like I'm an imposter   I really hope it gets better for both of us  got the copper IUD  no hormones   no risk for higher rates of depression  mood changes  appetite changes etc the cramps are tough but its worth it  My cats one of my best friends  he's 14  so we've been through the worst together   Orange cats   best cats  I'm a crazy cat man at 21 already and would have completely given up without kitty  We lay on the floor yesterday together for an hour or so  he was just purring gently  3 This is rape  Nothing else but it  Contact the police  go to the hospital  Tell your parents  You are loved  it isnt your fault  Be strong Agreed  doesnt even seem like theres room for guess work  In my own experience  I find that when I'm really depressed  I'm always looking at the world in the wrong way  somehow   a little "off " or a little too bleak  I study a lot of philosophy  and one of the things that I notice there is that the clearest thinkers don't really seem to be depressed  but they do seem to be sad  somehow  like they never quite lose sight of things like death  or the impermanence of what they love  a kind of melancholy runs through all of Aristotle  for instance  or through a really lucid poet  like Homer   So I think that's what being "too aware" looks like   a kind of sadness  rather than a kind of hopelessness   though  even with that being said  I'd still rather be too aware than not aware enough  Holy shit man  This sounds pretty god damn terrible  Really aren't words to express it or the sorrow we feel for you  One day at a time  It is an applicable and great thing to remember  Hugs to you OP  Big problems are not as big as they seem  just break them down into manageable chunks   I feel the same way  I wish I could enjoy my youth but I can't  Everyone else my age is living it up and making memories  I don't think things will get better for me  but I hope they get better for you  I was dying inside for years  so addicted to the thrill of fantasizing about my favorite characters living out amazing passionate lives  I was just like a junky  with stashes of fanfiction hidden around the house  and techniques for pretending to be interacting with people in the real world while actually I was fantasizing the whole time  If only I could have made that euphoric  enthralling feeling keep going and going I would still be doing it  but reality kept kicking me in the face and showing me the heartbreaking mess I was making of my real  one and only  life  For me I just had to stop completely  like alcoholics have to stop drinking completely  I had to do 12 Step recovery program with it  through Escapism   Fantasy Addicts Anonymous  I haven't daydreamed or fantasized compulsively for over 2 years  except for a few short slips   Things are really  really good now    One day at a time won't work so well in two days when everything comes crashing down on top of me   Definitely  My dogs are the best thing that's happened to me   I love philosophy too  but ain't a fan of reading    I have a novel that I want to share with the world someday  I'm still working on it  292 pages into it now  87k word count  Have you tried asking your doctor for a full lab work up   My new GP helped find out some deficiencies that have helped some of MY mobility issues   All in all it only cost a 100 bucks  with good insurance I admit  for both the doctor and the lab work   Even then it's a good idea to get regular lab work done if you're concerned about anything in particular  my mom does it for her thyroid too because she's borderline  I know what you mean  For me I get this feeling like "no you don't deserve that  They only do that out of pity  They don't really love you " It makes me feel like I'm about to be sick or start crying or take off in an airplane   All I can say is I'm sorry  I'm sorry these feelings exist and I'm sorry they plagued you  I'd love for you to turn around and wait out the storm but if not  goodbye my friend    There's never a bad reason to keep you alive  I remember the first time I watched family guy on Netflix  I told myself wait  just wait until you finish the season  Then wait until you finish the entire show  I have never stopped watching family guy  I think I've watched every episode at least 20 times and by watch I mean play in the background while I do things around the house  Anyways  I hope you find a reason to stay alive  no matter how silly or seemingly insignificant    I'm sorry homie I wish this didn't happen to people  Good luck man  with whatever you choose    Everyone thinks I'm depressed when I just know more than them  People will always let you down in the end  The world would be uneffected by your passing  People don't love you  the pity you  It's not pessimistic  it's a statement of fact   Wow that sounds really tough  Good on you for commitment    First off  if you haven't already been  it would be a good idea to get checked out by a doctor  It's great you have a personal trainer  but this could possibly be a red flag for a larger health problem and it's worth exploring   After that  you might try a kind of self experiment  Change one aspect of your workout and see if it still happens  If you work out at someplace besides the gym  does it happen  What about when you do cardio  If you only worked out for fifteen minutes  If you lie down and put your legs up the wall after you cool down  rule out poor blood flow to brain as a causative factor     Like Dr hooha said  are you on any medications or supplements that could be contributing to either anxiety or nausea  esp something like a pre workout supplement  In any case good luck figuring it out  I'm sure there's a way you can work out without this nasty aftereffect    I'd rather fail knowing I tried  Nobody got to where they are today by being a pessimist   I know you said not to answer but I talk too much anyway  I'll always come back to here  The rock bottom that I can't fall from  why  Because it's easy  There's no work for simply existing  I'll always come back to my little corner of nothing   What were they and dose  If you feel ill go to hospital  Add me for some overwatch tomorrow  Mrtembo 1354      Yes that's what goes through my mind as well  Like I don't deserve it  Or like they are only doing it because they have to which makes me push them away even more  Then after that I feel guilty for possibly hurting them    Hugs first  words can wait      Hugs     Now  for the talking part     Can't begin to imagine how hard it must be for you to acknowledge and live with what happened in your past    That being said  the first part of resolving an emotional trauma is to indeed to acknowledge it  Perhaps one of the reason why it seems so easy for your family to bear the whole burden and why you're experiencing so much trouble is because you're ahead of them  Alone  that is  I'd say you can be flipping proud of that  because you didn't chose the easy way out  You faced what happened  That'll pay  Hang in tough  you're facing the harsh part now  but it'll get better and better from there on     As for a way to get your arse out of the place  perhaps you can contact some former school mates that'd be back with their families around   It would present the advantage to give you someone to chat with that isn't necessary your doctor  You might also want to ask them  the medics  I mean   can't say I know how they're organised  let alone in the US  but I'm fairly sure they've seen this kind of situation before  They may have advice for you   Yeah I hear you  I wish I had the same drive  Gl Yeah  no kidding  You go to the trouble of putting yourself out there and they just pretend you don't exist  Fuck'em  Ride the storm  Sounds terrible but one day you'll thank me for this  Just keep that in your head  One day the storm will be over I think you're good  We're in the same place  but I'm on the other side of this  I rarely even touch other people  like at all  Alternatively  I'm a fat piece of shit  who from the neck up is like a solid 6  but the rest is another story  Don't feel bad about that shit  were in the same  lonely boat  Is there any evidence that increased acetylcholine is associated with depression   By evidence I mean scientific studies  not anecdotes   Only if you are male  Yup  Women live on easy mode  That's why I got a bed heater  It's like a mattress pad but warm  And a body pillow to hold  It's really nice to snuggle into a warm bed with a warm squishy thing to hug  It's especially nice because my room has like zero insulation  and the heat is shitty  It always makes me feel like I'm running closer to the temperature everyone else is  instead of a few degrees colder  You were raped sweetie  I am so sorry this happened to you  and you need to report this   Keep the texts as proof  screenshot and save them  If you have any clothes from that night save them  Do not wash them  IT can be used as proof   I am so sorry  Don't listen to them  sweetie  and take care of yourself and report this  Stay strong  3 I feel pretty much the same way  The pettiest of things will go wrong like an awkward conversation  and walking away from it I'll just feel like I don't deserve my own existence  I'm not sure if I'm one to say anything  because I've never had the balls to do something like you did  but I feel as if it was justified  If these people do that every weekend  and you've been content through all that shit  then you have every right to such a simple request  Don't let people get to you  I know damn well it's hard af  but if you can just realize that such an event is insignificant and miniature it helps  Best wishes for you  Ok will do thanks Go by yourself  dude   I went to see The Force Awakens by myself and it was an amazing experience  Once the movie starts  it's just you and the film  That's it  You can lose yourself fully and bathe in the world illuminated on the screen  It's fantastic   I too was nervous about going to the theater by myself   and there is absolutely no reason to be  No one gives a damn  they're there for the movie either with people or by themselves    You'll be fine   Good luck  I wish for your peace  dead or alive  I remember yesterday I had an anxiety attack and was scared of driving  I was basically driving drunk  I took the easiest route possible with all protected left turns and no tight streets etc    Earlier this year I had an anxiety attack and my friend looked at me and stopped me and told me I had been stumbling all over the place as we were walking  He grabbed me by my armpits because he thought I would fall over  He didn't understand it and neither did I at the time    A week ago I was taking a customer's order when I had another attack and I started mumbling and saying the wrong words and slurring my words  It was really bad  My boss happened to be there at the time because we were understaffed for how built it was and asked if I would like her to take over  I walked into the back and sat down for 30 seconds  I didn't take another order all shift and we never talked about it after  I think she understood     Yup anxiety sucks sometimes homie unfortunately it comes at bad times where you should be the most functional    I can definitely relate  Push through it my friend   Sure thing  I added ya Nothing great to add  Sorry to say but denial is the first step  Also try use the time you have now to enjoy what might be your last moments  I would wait out thinking of the future  I'm sorry to hear about your circumstance  hope someone has something better but if you need support message me   I know this is a weird question  but how much sleep do you get  Also  do you feel your thoughts racing  The way you feel about drawing is the way I feel about writing  especially when I read how excellent people my age  older and younger too   are compared to me  I know you might not find this very helpful since you seem to have been through a lot  but you can talk to me if you want  I've been close to suicide as well but after a long time of suffering I know that things will start to get better  even though it might seem very slow at first  Absolutely no one  Except one person at work   I know what you mean  The last 6 years of my life felt like someone else was controlling me and now I'm just waking up and having to live in the mess they created    What do you mean by 'even science is the meaning'   I'm talking about the Big Rip  and no I'm not aware that it's outdated  Dark matter might hold the key to further refined answers   I wouldn't say I've got things figured out  I'm just saying this is what I know  and I agree that we are insignificant  I mean  I'm a fan of Cosmicism  And I'm also aware that humans can never attain the ultimate truth give that we are so limited with our ability to observe  You're not an awful human being  You know why  Because you realized you made a mistake  came clean about it and apologized  Now only that  you come on here to berate yourself and go hard on your own slip up when you did not have to   The very fact that you're on here posting about this shows how sorry you are and that you are a good person   Calm down  we all make mistakes like this more often than not  You're not a bad person  At all  That's a very good question  one that I often ponder the answer to  I often think if I was stupid and a bit of a gullible idiot  would I be so sad  Interesting point though  nice to know I am not the only one  I have PTSD and DP but it's not gonna be forever  It's a temporary road block  One day the bunnies will hop  I'm nearly 26 and expected to be touring the world as a musician  was loosing my mind till Fall Out Boys engineer said man I didn't do anything till my mid 30s  looks around at packed arena show   You are young  Nothing's forever  Work on you first  Things will come if you work at them inch by inch  Hello friend  want to talk  What happened  Did anything happen in your life that seemed to trigger it  I get where you are coming from  I often think "I wish that I had the desire to self harm again"  Slightly different I know  From what you say about not having anyone to lean on  it's almost as if one half of your brain could be hinting to the other half about suicide yet the other half not agreeing    If that makes sense  Basically in answering your question  yes   it does make sense     good    What kind of character and campaign are you playing  Are you a player character or the DM  Thank you  Try deactivating facebook  its a subconscious mindfuck that can make you depressed  Yes  They actually have made really weighed blankets for anxiety and depression for this reason    Same way dude  I'm a senior and I really regret not getting help my freshman  junior years  Dude get help it's never too late  Also  you know those people who drop out of college but still end up rich  Yeah this is probably why  Anyways  get help dude and don't worry too much about your future  it'll work itself out    My suggestion  where do you live  In LA  you can go to a community college for three years and USC for two and graduate with a masters  That's shorter than going to USC freshman year masters and you get the same degree for cheaper    Bottom line  it'll work out  You will most likely transfer to a good college eventually if you are smart and have all of your shit sorted out  Hello friend  sorry to hear you're having a hard time    What kind of job do you have now  What's your living situation  Just had this happen  water helped  Caffeine helped a bit  Sleep cured it  but then its a new day to get a headache  I like to think that I am a realist aware  but I'm probably just depressed as shit    It's probably both to some degree   Wowzers that is so awesome  brings a smile to my face   eugh if only I had an NA account to play on i would definitely play with you   norms is legit  as you said LoL is life  ez game  ez life    Fantastic to hear  I wish you all the best     you go grill  Hello friend  sorry to hear you're having a hard time   I remember being a Junior in high school  Apart from applying to grad school  it was one of the most stressful times in my life  As a 32 year old man now with a bit of perspective  I can say this  my depression and stress as a high schooler was a bit out of proportion to that actual threat level   What's most important right now is your mental health  Have you talked to your parents about this  Are you getting any professional help right now    It might seem crazy to think about  but you might want to take a semester or year off school  In the grand scheme of things  that extra time might save your life  and it won't cost you that much   Good luck What exactly should one practice though  I have attempted to initiate small talk with both male and female  and people literally speak their last words while running away from me  Go to a psychologist and find the right one till you get an answer  Your post meets many things from normal human emotions to Cyclothymia to anxiety  It's hard in a post to know  All I will say is if it's effecting your day to day life there is a problem  Get help and not from a doctor  Me too    Everyone who knows me already sees me as inferior and subhuman and below them  but if they knew I was actively seeking therapy and the specific thoughts going through my mind  they'd probably try to kill me or at least cut me out of their lives   Hey friend  thanks for sharing your story  Would you be willing to share your video or your writing    Confidence comes from repeatedly being in challenging situations and getting through them  If you have lost confidence in yourself  I am certain you can build it back    What do you like to write about   lol awkward girls are deemed cute and playful  Awkward guys are deemed weak  If its a combination of antidepressants or extremely high dose you could have serotonin sickness  this is no joke  Very dangerous call someone  That is most definitely rape call the police and tell your parents We're terribly sorry for your loss  but this belongs in  r SuicideBereavement rather than here    Story sounds similar  I know what you are going through  Depression is a very personal journey  Even meds  what works for one doesn't work for others  Hence why to some people depression is this thing that you just "go out and do stuff" and everything's sweet  Explore your avenues  Hang in there and message me if you wanna talk  It's a Mozda  It's beautiful and it was a gift  The exact color I wanted and drives so smooth   Please do not ever do what I did  Even if you're pissed off and you're aware you haven't eaten  drive safely    I haven't stopped crying since it happened yesterday  Hello friend  thanks for sharing your story   My advice is to spend time with your dad  worry about your mom after  Yes  she'll probably want to lean on you for support for a while  and you shouldn't put any time limit on it  But  your mom loves you too  and she wants you to have your own life   People always keep saying you just need more practice  even professionals like therapists  but unfortunately there is no manual to practice by  and you rarely get a clean social slate in your adulthood   It's incredibly awkward when you start chatting up people all of sudden when they all know you're an awkward loner  This was such a lovely kind hearted post  i'd really like to know what rule was broken  c  unless they're considered ugly Ugly women have choices of men after them  including attractive men  just less of them than average or above women   They choose their loneliness  I didn't know about that sub  thanks  I feel like I dream of how my life could be better    I really want it to be   but the thought of me being "happy" is so foreign because I've never been happy before  I feel like it'd be a completely different me and it scares me    The way I currently live  my beliefs that is  seem completely idiotic and ridiculous to me  even though I have trouble denying that they are true   It explain why I never got the happit of brushing teeth  Just installed the app  it's great   Thanks I guess if mental health issues are such a big part of one's life  it is hard to envisage a life without them  I mean we don't know anything different right   I personally think that depression and other things have completely ruined my life to every degree  I reckon I could have been a pilot  or a football player or a scientist   You name it  I could have done it  I was one of  those  kids teenagers    People often say to me "you are not your illness"  However  that's not true as mental health stuff is all I have to talk about  I am deeply ashamed of who I am today and I have no sense of identity or belonging     Bit negative tbh yet that's my story haha  Playing a Goliath paladin and we are playing the elemental evil campaign  Man I've got hardly any hair on my crown but no one knows  The one secret  thickening hair spray  Like spray on hair basically  Pm if you wanna know what one  But no girl has ever noticed  Some of my friends thought my hair regrew magically till I told them lol  Honesty if you get this you'll never think about it again  Problem solved  I swear  Most definitely you have to go to the hospital  contact your parents and the police  You might say you feel confused or scared but in no question you're not at fault   What you described is rape   I hope so too  I'm sorry for your loss  I know mine doesn't compare  it still hurts though  I really mean my congratulations though  I truly hope you win the war  Depression is just plain unfair  It's good to know people still care about us though  that helps  I hope you get another two tomorrow  I'm proud of you   Huh    that's interesting  Sounds a little similar to my situation  Might take a look into that group  p  Just some feedback for you  You do realize that when you quarantine a certain type of post to a different sub  it's going to get less views than on the main sub  right   r depression has 150K subscribers   r SuicideBereavement has 1 6K  so about 1    I'm just curious  what was the reasoning behind this  I will of course respect the rules of this sub  Just wondering   ORLY   http   2damnfunny com wp content uploads 2014 03 Louis C K  On Men Being The Number One Threat To Women Since The Dawn Of Time jpg  You are a sovereign consciousness who has every right to exist  If others try to make you think otherwise  berate you  degrade you  they are wrong  Not you  I can kind of relate  like one time some guy flipped me off and yelled fuck you while driving  and i told myself if he stopped by this one public store i would confront him and just ask him why i did  felt really proud and posted to FB  everyone just told me how bad of an idea it was  like sure i could have been beat up  but like  i was just made to feel like shit for standing up for myself  i dont do it nmuch because i usually lose whatever argument or situation it is  and feel like ill lose the relationship because its not as important to them  so i just shut up   LET YOURSELF FEEL GOOD Women choose that by going out with abusive alpha males   Not a slut  You were raped  Go make a police report please  Thanks for the hope  Glad to hear you are out the rabbit hole  It makes me wonder how those sorts of people actually get anywhere in life   I've gotten so angry from being treated like how you describe above that I have smashed things and hurt myself quite badly before  It's a double edged sword  if we stay and keep talking to them we feel like we are being used and abused  If we leave then we have no one to talk to  or less people to talk to   That's not true       Hello friend  sorry to hear you're having a rough time  It sounds like you're still having some unresolved guilt about your grandmother  and now with your aunt I definitely get that it would be overwhelming    When my grandfather was on his deathbed  my Mom called me to let me know  I asked her if I should fly home  I had my finger on the buy button for plane tickets  but she said not to worry about it  He died that night  So  I can sympathize with your feelings   When does school start for you  Can you take more time off  Do you got a support structure around you  Who else have you talked to about this  I guess it depends on the medication and the dosage  I've used three different antidepressants and I never struggled with not being able to cry or express emotions   Fuck your family  Religion is no excuse to shun family    Never undervalue your brother  him standing up for you is brave of him  haHAA ty  Im one of the only girls who actually hates playing support lol  It's just not fun to me  But hey  at least i get to stream as well so perks  P Yeah I've had similar thoughts dreams before   I see them mourning over my dead body broken in tears for days  and a week later I'm almost forgotten  another week or two and I'm rarely remembered   I think you're stressing out without reason  you see  if she likes you  it's not that important how you say it and she'll be glad  if she doesn't  no matter how you say it  it's not gonna make her like you and the information will be communicated and she might feel awkward  oh well  that's the way things are if you plan on telling her   if I should give you any advice  I'd say be yourself  just be your natural self  either you're loved for who you are  or you're not  and if it should unfortunately go south  love yourself enough to know that you will find somebody better  who actually feels the same way about you as you do about them   I'm going to go on a trip with a girl I like soon  my way of talking is making a lot of jokes  showing wit  analyzing her and situations in fun way  etc  so I drop "hints" that are kinda obvious  make the whole thing fun and since she's into me  she responds positively  we're having a good time  after the hint joke part I just got serious and express my feelings very bluntly and we talked openly about it and things are going great  this is not advice on how you should do it  I just wanna tell you that being natural and confident is the most important thing  next to valuing yourself and understanding that the potential loss is in no way related to your worth or whatever  I know I'm talking about this more broadly then what was in your question  but either way  if you're gonna risk it  don't stress  be yourself  it's wise to prepare for both scenarios  I wish you good luck man  Hello friend    That's the bitch of depression  it's a disease with no known cure  only treatment  and the things that trigger a depressive episode might not be based in reality  Even people who have a great life "on paper" can be diagnosed  just look at Robin Williams et al   You're seeking help  and you started medicating  so that's a step in the right direction  All I can offer is  don't get discouraged if your meds don't help as much as you think they should  Keep working with your doctor to tweak your prescription or try different meds  And keep in mind  the meds will never "cure" you  but they might make it so that instead of staying in bed all day  for example   you muster enough motivation to get up and go to the gym  etc    Good luck friend The only way to fix depression would be to remove the emotion  the hurt    and we need that  The best thing is to find balance    peace    I guarantee you aren't alone   in any of the "weird" things you feel think  or "bad" habits    Procrastination is one of the biggest symptoms of depression  but not really commonly known     Obviously it's good if we do all the things we should every day   but for a lot of us that isn't realistic just yet    Don't try to "fix" everything at once  we are more likely to fail and that is likely to make us get more depressed    Doing like OP and starting with one basic thing and creating a habit is the way to go   then we get the pride of succeeding  the knowledge we CAN succeed  and find it is enjoyable  It makes us feel better about ourselves  even just a little  and can motivate us to take another step    Start with small  easily attainable goals for each day  Even if it is a list that can be completed in 10 minutes   it is still a list of accomplishments to check off  and still is something to reflect on at the end of the day    No Zero Days  look that up online   there are a few write ups about the concept     We don't have to do it all at once   we just need to at least one little thing each day  The rest will follow    Don't worry  there are a TON of us     I feel guilt   not because everything they try to do for me or give but just because it seems like I don't deserve what they offer   if that makes sense  I got led on twice in the same way    And now I just keep getting rejected  Wow  180 is super high  I'm freaked out at my lowly 130s  haha  I never did because it settled down after a few days  Back to a gentle 95  bpm  But it's definitely a stimulant  I slept for 5 5 hrs  night for a whole month  My hands still shake  Sometimes my legs shake when I'm sitting down    Yeah  I'm the same with standing up  It's weird  I got a check up a week ago and everything is healthy  I just have a really high heart rate  I ran track in hs and everything  and I'm considered fitter than a number of my friends  Less sedentary too   Ok  Depending on the day  When I'm good  I like to go out   My relationship ended because of my depression  I can somewhat understand  Let me just tell you two years down the line it gets a lot easier  for me it's no longer daily which you can't imagine right now  My advice is try and win her back because if it doesn't happen  and you can never make something work one sided  the strength you have inside  you've got it bro  will come out fighting  you are still holding onto this  It's terrible advice but end the chapter by closing it  Someone can't be your life partner if they can't be there at the bottom  For better or for worse right  Depression is part of life  Don't blame yourself  If you ever even think of attempting something message me or ring a help line  Human support is nice knowing that you aren't alone sometimes  My life recipe is as following  pc   tv   pet   family  Anything else can f off lol  My personal goal is to create my own family someday  even if if seems impossible sometimes      Absolutely tell your parents  I let it slip one day and I thought it was the worst day of my life  but now I'm getting help  great sounds good to me Controlling relationships aren't healthy  It's not uncommon to see a controlling partner take advantage of another partner that needs them more than they need the other person  Whether it be money  a place to stay or emotional support  Not having a place to go is awful but that also gives him much more power over you  Staying with someone because you have no place else to go is a terrible reality for many people  You made the right decision for yourself  Stay strong  If you need a friend to talk to send me a pm  My lifes not perfect either  and I need a pen pal myself   Exactly  give them all the help in the world take your advice proceed to throw it in the bin and will only you message you with more bullshit problems It's not a small thing    It's like the saying "the straw that broke the camel's back"   one little piece of straw wouldn't break its back by itself  but when it's that last one  that 'little straw' is pretty big    Think of your situation as the reverse  Someday when you are on top of the world  you'll look back on this small thing and smile because the end effect of this small thing was so huge   Awesome job     If you are an attractive woman you aren't doomed to be alone  regardless of how bad your depression is  Even if you have no will to socialize you can still find someone  That's not the case for males  You were raped  and it was ENTIRELY NOT your fault  NOTHING you did makes it your fault  You were drunk and COULD NOT consent  Go to the police now and report them  Yea I get the same feeling anytime someone's nice to me  I'll be greeted with a hug and "I'm glad to see missed you" and all I can manage is a blank stare in return  I just don't know how to process positive feedback from other people cause I'm so used to bing shit on   this exact thing happened to me too and it fucking sucks  I'm so sorry they did this to you  its the worst feeling  I feel you op  I come and go in this sub  Just reading about other people's experiences has made me feel less crazy  and if I'm able to help others a bit  then that's good for everyone  The other thing that this sub has provided me is perspective  I see a lot of the same things over and over  and through that I understand my own depression better   We're happy you're here  But if you want to leave  don't worry about it  Thank you for your kind words  they really resonated with me   You had some really good advice that I will keep in mind   You're right  I shouldn't let the negativity get to me  and focus more on the positives in my life   I appreciate it  thanks once again  I have 3 options  1 Stay with my boyfriend and continue another year of toxic behavoir and constant fighting 2 Leave him and be completely isolated and lonely since i actually no friends and no idea how to make any 3  Kill myself to get out of the situation Have been feeling more and more fonder of the last choice recently I went to one for years and it really helped me    it's ok    truly  it's ok I mainly write about whatever is on my mind at the time   It could literally be anything   They often don't make much sense  but I try to make them into something interesting   At least  I try to do that anyway  Ugh I feel completely the same about literally everything you just described  The difference being that I oscillate between "the shitty norm" down to "abysmal " Years of this has made me not want to even sit back and ride the shitty norm days when I don't feel super terrible  because I know it's just going to hit hard again out of nowhere    Like I'm scared to let myself enjoy things bc I know how terrible it feels to get that capability taken away suddenly  I don't even have anything helpful to say just that I feel you and it's fucking ridiculous   depressing in itself       And everything you said about relationships   obligations towards people  yea  I feel that completely  too  all the time  And I agree  fuck that      You've got a friend in me if you ever need to vent xx  3 Hey friend  thanks for this  Any advice on how to induce crying  I feel sad but also emotionally constipated  Thanks no problem man  feel free to pm me too  but im going to bed right now so ill get back to you in like 12 hours  you can litterally pm anything  idgaf  I know   at first it really helped but I had allergic reaction to the only medicine that helped me   Me too Just try to live through and don't do stupid shit and focus on your studies that way you will succeed I've been doing this for as long as I can remember  I imagine myself in a different life and as a different person     I dream up their entire life story  their future and everything  I think of it as my way of escaping from my grey reality   Though sadly  as my depression has worsened over the last few years I've noticed that my imagination has decreased with it  c keep writing  a vent is a vent  So dont be too critical about the output  feel free to share it with reddit when your comfortable with feedback You can be lonely in a relationship  you can't be alone and being alone is worse  At least in the situation OP is talking about  doomed to be alone   involuntarily being alone for a long time  forever  Try again  Yeah  that's fair enough  I know people are not in competition intentionally  I think the titles of the posts when you often read the front page just read like the headlines of a newspaper  but I have posted 'headline's' in the past here so I'm not judging   I'm glad the sub exists and I'm glad it is so active but I feel it is a double edged sword for some people  like myself    Yes I find it rather annoying  And exposing the main cohort of  r depression to messages of this type is both irrelevant and distressing     Irrelevant  Suicidality and depression are entirely separate issues   They are often comorbid  but although depression is positive correlated with suicidal thought  it's negatively correlated with suicidal  behaviour      Distressing   This type of message is basically salt in the psychological wounds of those who feel that there is no one who cares about them     Don't EVER let a woman  or any human being for that matter  control your emotional frame of mind  I just looked into this  I never knew it was actually something   I thought it was just an active imagination    Thanks for sharing this with everyone   how so   Hey dude  I started with 2 also  I heard in a LifeProTips to do like 15 pushups a day would make my body look better  I've managed to do 2  and I was super sore in the other day haha  I'm still VERY skinny  but now I'm able to do 30  I still do it everyday  D Everyone I talked to who had it said they lost at LEAST 5 pounds in the first few weeks going off of it  I'm scared I'm stuck at this weight and am going to have to work super hard to get it off now       big hug       Thank you for responding  I don't have any former schoolmates that I'm comfortable with  but I called my psychologist and am talking with her tomorrow over the phone  I don't think there is a way for me to be away from my family besides waiting the 6 days till my flight back  I'm in Australia  but the state I'm currently in has a terrible health system setup and don't help unless you're actively dying in front of them  I just have to hang on for 6 days  and see what my psychologist says tomorrow  Thanks again  you're very kind This was beautiful and very relatable  From my experience with my depression often you need to go to the source of your depression and that may mean looking at specific areas of your life you need to work on  Identifying the source of the pain which leads to the feelings is difficult and in my experience needs either years of introspection or a very good professional in real life   Maybe this sub is like a gateway  a top level where you acknowledge you have an illness  You make your way from here to somewhere more specific and deeper where you can work on the specific problems and try and fix and improve them   One example for me  r stopdrinking which helped me to have 3 months off drinking last year but also that community helped shed a light on my addictive behaviour  yes I'm drinking again but with open eyes and realisation that it compounds my depression  Maybe others may need help with grief or money  I suppose those that don't know what the problem is may have more soul searching to do here and in real life     It's an interesting predicament this condition puts you in  Thanks for the response  Any thoughts on answers  Pretty much me to I just end up staying sad mostly even during really good happy moments that I have  I may have a small smile very short  but I end up always staying sad cause I know it's coming anyway so I'm just stuck in unhappy sad mode or whatever you wanna call it I agree with these posts  you were taken advantage of  Its gonna be a tough pill to swallow so go easy on yourself  Go easy on yourself and speak with the police and speak with some loved ones   Thanks for the response   I am very content by myself  I have been "alone" for the majority of my life  and preferred it that way for awhile   The issue I face now is that I am not happy with the same old life routine  and whenever I try to change it I feel like I just shoot myself in the foot   I do care about myself and that's  why  I am unhappy   I feel like every time I try to save myself life is like  "nope  not today "  I do not live in an area that is healthy or good for my development  All of my friends have moved away because they'd experienced the same feelings while they were living here   I know the only way to save myself from feeling like shit is to move   I've sold my house in order to move  so it isn't like I'm all talk and no action  I know moving is my only hope   I don't need a girl to be happy  I have been happy absent of relationships   Just at a point in life where it is very clear to me that life would be easier and more fulfilling with someone who cared about me  so I took a chance at trying to open my heart to someone   And that was the point of my referencing this in my first post   It was another example at how I tried to give positivity a chance and it backfired   I am not one of those people who think they need a girl to be happy  that's all bull shit   People should be able to function by themselves  you can't rely on another person to make you happy   But when you are content alone and then let someone into an intimate part of yourself  and then you realize that maybe they are being dishonest in some ways  well  it hurts   Makes you sad  Makes you depressed   It happens   Essentially  sitting here living in this shit hole of a state wasting my youth away is frustrating to me  and I feel like I have failed myself   Life is short and I want to enjoy it  preferably with a girl   As of now  I have no idea where I'll move   Still trying to figure that one out  I just know it's the best idea that is a doorway to a healthy future   In the meantime  my battle is trying to deal with the negative people in my current situation but it's taking it's toll on me and I'm not sure how much patience I have in me before I just blow up   This is my big mountain right now    trying to stay calm in the midst of absolute stupidity  It's so good that you're coming out the other side  but I understand your fear  It's a big change  It's definitely a good thing  but your mind may take a while to figure that out  Stick with it and keep on climbing  A life surrounded by nothing but pets would be a good life  I think  Animals are dope  On the other side  though  I've got some great family members who are just fantastic people and the only reason I'm sticking around  I think it's great to have a pet  or pet  s    to find comfort in  but I think you should also find an awesome person or two as well    Not to keep them as pets   but just as friends     possibly even in a romantic relationship   Humans are generally greedy a holes with no empathy at all  but even if only 20  of humans on earth are worth the air they breathe  that's still a lot of good people out there doing their best  Just gotta weed through all the jerks  It only takes a few friends to be stoked about every day of your life  just put in enough hard work and and embarassment to find a few  Being lonely is less likely than being someone with a few really good friends  Once you have them  fuck everyone else lol Yeah  but it's weird how it's different with other people  like I still remember a bomb ass hug I got from a guy friend that was honestly like the best thing ever I'm basically the exact same way  I've tried so many different jobs  each time I start it and for a few months I'm like "oh ok this is alright I could handle this" and then after 6 months I'm sick of it and ready to quit  But I can't quit because money  so then the options are either spend most of your free time applying for a different job  or check out of the system altogether   Now I don't even want to apply to any places  because the definition of insanity is doing the same thing and expecting a different result  Why would one job be any better than the last  Why go through all that tedious bullshit of making a resume  sending out cover letters  making phone calls  bullshitting through interviews  etc for months  if after the job starts it's going to be right back to thoughts of suicide   I see nothing I could do that would satisfy me  Nothing realistic anyway   it's of course childish to want to be a musician or whatever in the modern day  which is the only thing that might actually be workable  And given that I'm not religious and therefore am not superstitious about death  I am fully willing to kill myself  At this point I'm just waiting for the right time  Go to the police right away  Be strong   Please be safe and take care of yourself  Make sure you have people around you that can take care of you In my line of work as a NYC Paramedic  guys only give girls drugs  including alcohol in terms of not of drinking age girls  for free if they want or expect they are going to take advantage of her  Sounds like you were raped  If you want to press charges I suggest you not clean yourself for DNA collection purposes and go to the authorities ASAP  1  It doesn't have to be an entire year   If you don't think it's fixable then it may be best to move on   2  Try and reach out to people   Old friends  family  or just find something silly to do   As hard as it may be  find a way to find people to be with   Being alone makes life extremely difficult   We aren't meant to be all alone   3  Someone needs you in their life  even if you don't think so   Someone does or will need you   Decide between 1 2  I stay the fuck away from it  Can't get out of my head when I'm high  Maaan  I didn't lose my virginity til like 21  I don't think it's anything to be ashamed of   And generally  I feel you  I'd like to have people in my life for every reason you listed too  Hopefully it works out   Brush it off if it doesn't   Best of luck man  Wow  That's a big dose when considering the Wellbutrin and Adderall dosage together  I'm very glad to hear that you wouldn't ever go through with suicide   I've never been a good student either  I was very luck to find someone willing to give me my break  I'm sure that person is out there for you too   I'll be your friend if you want  Hello my lonely friend  it sounds like you just need to go to a bar on a Friday or Saturday night and ask random girls if they would like to go on a date with you some time in the future    Make sure to tell them what you like about them  your hobbies  your job and more about yourself  Prepare to get rejected a lot by girls who are married and who have boyfriends  lesbians and girls who just like guys who aren't like you    Regardless of that fact  make sure you don't take rejection personally and keep moving down the line after being denied    Good luck and happy hunting  my soon to not be lonely friend     You got this   Why you hate us  I am so sorry for your loss  and I feel your pain  I'm having a hard time finding the right words  but for now  I'd like to say this   The initial shock and pain will wear off over the next few days  It will be replaced by a dull ache in your chest  Occasionally it will return  but every time it does  it will be slightly more bearable  and slightly less painful  It will never quite go away though  Which  in my opinion is good  You don't really want it to   I reckon everything feels a little surreal right now  If so  it's because you haven't really registered what's happened completely  and probably won't for a little while yet    Once the dust has settled  when all the condolences and shows of support are finished rolling in  some time in maybe a few days  weeks or months  When the world has moved on  That's when you will be hit with the true realisation of what's happened and it will hit you hard    I urge you  please  Don't stand in it alone  Your family loves you  and they are in the same place as you  They will need you  as much as you will need them  Cry openly  Talk to each other  Scream at the world if you need it    Remember  There is no limit to mourning  You will never stop  And it's okay not to    I hope you all the best  Good luck  I'll be thinking of you and your family in the year to come     Man  Well  I'm a woman and I know you're not trash  for what it's worth  Rejection hurts   I was turned down a couple months ago  too  Well  you posted that here  I am proud of you for that   I just checked your profile and saw that you play overwatch  how is your PC good enough for that if you live in south east Europe  I had to refund the game because my PC wasn't good enough which sucks  it felt like being poor on Christmas back when there was a ton of hype about the game and I couldn't play it  I would most likely uninstall league of legends If i could play overwatch  I know that feel  my dad died the same way   he was ok  and the next day he was dead  Time heals  it will get better  just pray for her and for yourself   About 8 or 9 years ago I started an SSRI  and experienced something similar after a week and a half of taking it  I have only a very vague memory of the experience but according to family I had showed up to my mom's work  hospital  barefoot   in my sleep clothes  I was rambling that I couldn't stop "falling down through the basement of the church" into hell and I needed help  The only real memory I have of those couple days is doing a lot of drawing writing and thought it was automatic writing from a ghost or demon trying to send a message through me  Even the movement of my body felt outside of me  like someone else was moving me as a doll or something       That was almost 10 years ago and I still have the same diagnosis and it's never happened again to that extent at least  since I stopped the SSRI after that incident        u outofshell may be onto something bc I'm bipolar w  dysphoric mania  But I've honestly never had a manic episode that felt like that  even my more paranoid anxious ones don't even come close   Damn  I only got A's and B's my first two years in college  I wish I was really smart  I just kept telling myself that engineering is hard  My peers didn't think so hahah   So anyways  instead of wanting to crawl into a hole and die  you should want to go outside and explore the world and all the cool shit in it    I bet you can find the confidence to ask the girl you have a crush on if you expect her to reject you  Just come to terms with it and anticipate it    You can just be like  "hey  I really like this about you  and I'd like to go on a date with you  just text me later or not at all whenever you made up your mind "  So what's on your bucket list   That was a rape  tell your parents now  I've trained myself to answer insome rehearsed tone or something just so no one asks anything Not a snowballs chance in hell  Had it for too long  Dude that's not funny   You're very welcome  I highly recommend you read the book "Why Am I Still Depressed " by Dr  Jim Phelps  My psychiatrist recommended it to me  with the warning that some of the information is a little outdated   It goes over a lot of these issues  such as what very mild cases of hypomania can look like  Many people think they're just having a rare good day  What's significant is that you're having breaks in the depression yet continue to relapse  In contrast  someone with just depression would have one or two major episodes throughout their life  during which they would not experience relief  However  once the depression is over  it's over  Bipolar depression comes and goes   The book also discusses the idea that bipolar disorder and unipolar depression are on a spectrum  and it's possible to not "really" be bipolar but be just bipolar enough that you'd do better on mood stabilizers than antidepressants  Not all mood stabilizers are scary  especially the ones for milder cases  I personally am on Tegretol and Lamictal  and haven't had many side effects other than a little bit of forgetfulness  Nothing more significant than forgetting a word in the middle of a conversation  In contrast  before I took these meds I was suicidal  Definitely worth it   When I was on antidepressants  lexapro  to be specific   I did find them to help enormously in terms of making that awful  empty feeling go away and preventing me from becoming suicidal  However  I did continue to experience mild depression and changes in attitude   for example  being talkative and productive one day  and antisocial and exhausted the next   I highly recommend you read this book and request an evaluation  Good luck with everything  Nah you're better without her mate  You'll find better people to fill your time with dont worry  Do things you normally wouldn't go to conventions  study your school work at coffee shops  just go outside more and you're sure to meet some crazy person that fits your personality  This is how I feel about every hobby or skill I've tried my hand at so far in life  including drawing  You did everything right in your apology  She's being somewhat passive aggressive to you with her short responses  and I wonder why  It seems like a really easy thing to forgive since you were so thorough and sincere  I feel there must be more to it for her to be mad at you in this way  But  considering she has responded to you at all and that she hasn't blown up at you  I feel like your friendship can get passed this  Give her a little time and check to see how she is doing in a few days  Good luck   Never really thought of it that way before  That would be really great  I'd totally be willing to try that instead of wanting to die  Like a computer that just has too much junk on it  viruses and malware  the brain just gets too cluttered  Bad memories and experiences that don't go away  It would be wonderful to start over    During the holidays I actually bought a new hard drive for my computer and when it arrived I decided rather than just adding it to the total storage of my system  I disconnected the two old ones and put them away and started fresh with this one  Those old drives had files and folders and thousands of pictures from the last decade  Any time I wanted to find something it took forever to navigate  It has been so refreshing to use my PC now that there's hardly anything on it  I'm careful about what I add to it  I try not to just save random funny pictures and stuff that would clutter everything up all over again  The old hard drives are still available if I ever need to plug them in and find something  but that doesn't seem likely   That would be great to get a chance to do that with my brain  Forget about all the pain and disappointment I've experienced  Start over fresh and make an effort to not let things get so cluttered again  Sometimes it's too difficult to untangle something and sort it all out  you just need a clean slate   Not everyone is comfortable talking on the phones for long periods of time Me and my best friend cant talk anymore  Her boyfriend is jealous of me  like to a extreme    So i thought it would be best for their relationship if i wasn't her friend anymore   The feelings worse than a breakup  Did i do the right thing  The community is here for you  You're not alone Go to the police immediately  Stay safe  Should I call her tomorrow  If she doesn't answer leave a voicemail  What would you do if you were in her situation  Your hate is wasted on heterosexuals  if you have to hate anyone hate bullies  We don't hate you  I don't really have any advice I guess except hope you find happiness and kick this depression  Good luck  welcome to PM me if you ever need to talk  Man  You and me  we're experiencing such similar situations  Two or three months ago I ceased pretty much all contact from my family because they are toxic and manipulative   Doing that has been so hard  because I didn't just abandon the people  but also the hope of having a loving and supportive family that I so desperately need right now  If you would like someone to talk to about this  I'm all ears  I would really like to  Couldn't you just hide that you don't belive in god    I love cinematography  Studied a bit about it  It's funny if one can just sit there and watch a movie without thinking too much about it  Or analyzing the colors being used  the composition  the number of cuts and so on   Yes  I think connection is something very personal  Sometimes I go completely contrary to public opinion on a piece  umph I hope that doesn't sound hipster      It's nothing to be ashamed of  either   Frankly I don't know about that yet    Are those the extremophiles  badass organisms that prefer what we as humans would consider 'extreme conditions'    Interesting enough they are not     They are not considered extremophilic because they are not adapted to exploit these conditions  This means that their chances of dying increase the longer they are exposed to the extreme environments  6  whereas true extremophiles thrive in a physically or geochemically extreme environment that would harm most other organisms  3  13  14    If you think about it  things could have gone the other way  if people had decided that gender roles would be opposite of what they are now  at a time when they were still being very actively incorporated into society  if that makes sense   things could have been very different   Yes  this whole fear of males about homosexuality isn't actually that old     These concepts are so malleable  and often  people use a greater power than themselves to justify it  Sometimes people would rather use faith than reason or science to make their decisions    Or 'nature'  There are also gay animals but who really cares  You can't convince those people    The only thing I can think of as being similar is 'real women have curves'   Okay  that's a valid example  It's true what you're saying    But we've set men to certain standards that shouldn't even define the whole of the person  i e   you have to have a well paying job and be the sole provider of the family's income   which isn't even very possible these days  and a lot of families have both parents working part or full time   that's probably why the idea is very slowly shifting  I hope    Strangely enough I never understand this "male me has to be the sole provider for the family" or "if my partner earns more than me my selfworth is seriously damaged"  I don't know why but that doesn't scratch me at all  Hey  I read a little bit of your post history  and I want to let you know that you seem very sweet and I'm glad you're still with us  I'm sorry life has been so rough for you that you have considered ending it  I can totally understand wanting to do something like that when you're in hell  You must feel very powerless and alone to be living with the family you have described  who call you a burden and other things no one should ever have to hear  You deserve better  Please know that I'm always here to talk about absolutely anything  You have mentioned wanting to move to Germany

dopamine acetylcholine balance could be important in withdrawal related anxiety from amphetamines and opioids  Leap2 has the best advice anyone could give on the matter  Until the source of these attacks is rooted and a particular path of treatment is referred to  the best we can do is pull some guesses  In the mean time  there are several things you can try that wouldn't hurt at all  such as writing down whatever comes to mind during your attacks  maybe you'll find a pattern   brewing your preferred hot drink to settle down with  taking hot showers  rolling yourself in your covers to give yourself a sense of security  and so forth  Not everyone can be bothered to read long ass text messages  There's a reason people add 'TL DR' to Reddit posts   Sorry I'm not having a go at you intentionally it's just long boring texts that blab on really bother me personally and turn me off    From my experience I would suggest a few short sentences at most which quickly gives the message what's going on or how you're felling so the recipient gets the message quickly and easily then at the end add "can we get together to talk when you are free "  for example   I went on the mire a because my bipolar meds made my birth control ineffective  Anyhow  I lik it  My period has actually disappeared  I don't get one anymore  I haven't noticed any affect on my mood or anything    Just a tip though  see if you can get a ride home from the doctor  The cramps are bad after inserting  Also  pop some Tylenol or something an hour or so before the procedure    Annoying my friends with my constant negativity  it's hard for me to contribute any other way at this point  Everything feels like a waste  as if it was already decided for me to suck at everything I try to devote myself towards  I am absolutely hopeless for my future  this will probably be the happiest time of my life and I'm hating every second of it  Ich lernst Deutsch  The more I try fix the depression the more miserable I feel  Oh  I should also mention  Speaking as a woman who has spoken passive aggressively to someone  as your friend did to you  she is likely trying to hurt you a little bit  But  a sort of hurt that she still likes you in some way  It's just a weird  awful  thing girls do to mess with your head    The last time I did that I felt like I wanted to push that person away to hurt them  but also to hurt myself  Oh man  I know how you feel  Back when I still cared and had the energy  I would practice my trumpet and maybe play a few simple exercises reasonably ok  Then I'd see something like  this  https   youtu be RLDF8OeD hc t 304  and just think "oh    right    I can't play the trumpet  Nevermind "    On another note though  that's one  hell  of a cadenza     There's a reason Maurice Andre was so highly regarded  Every single note he plays is stunning    Also the same thing applies with drawing  I have so many ideas for things I need to draw but I've been graced with the almost complete inability to take something from my head and put it onto paper   you can get things called suspension trainers that you can hang over the back of a door or over a beam etc  The original brand for them is called TRX and they go for about 170GBP or you can do like I did and get a cheap knockoff from ebay for about 20GBP    As things like bodyweight training are becoming more popular things like rings etc are easier to get hold of too  It gives me an appetite  I swear I'd go days without eating more than a few crackers if I didn't use a little at meal times   Mmm  that sounds rough  I

beneath the carpet  It truly is something one needs to experience before understanding  Wishing you the best    Last night I watched The Amazing Spiderman 2 out of sheer boredom  The ending conveyed perhaps one of the most clichd motivational messages in the world  "keep fighting "   but goddamit if it didn't strike a chord deep within me  And oops    it's sprichst  not spricht    I guess I just really love that letter  Various reasons   I have always felt more "European" than in my current home country  Germany is in the center of Europe and since I either plan to move a lot or visit other European countries  it's best choice for me  Also I like German culture  language and people  And yes  I've been to Germany once  Lbeck   Well  the things that work take time and pain  Pain   pain is never going to feel good  Please don't do this  Direct your frustration towards something less harmful  I just looked up stats   https   www google com search q deaths historicallyby cause by gender That's such bullshit   Also  men are more likely to be killed by men   Just gotta stay away from assholes   I would never initiate violence against anyone   I smoke a lot  I pay careful attention to my strains though and why I'm smoking  it's just like any other drug prescription whatever   like coffee  Would you drink espresso before bed  Doing something like that could make you think coffee was horrible  why does anyone drink the stuff   Oh wait  you're doing it wrong   Sorry to you and your family for your loss  Cant imagine how muc pain it would feel  Hope you can in good time continue to make the progress you recently had  in good time  What are the things you think you need to do  If what you are trying is painful  maybe it doesn't actually work  and you could try something else  One difficult part about healing from trauma and depression is that we may bury painful feelings because they are too much at the time they arrive  We become numb to protect ourselves  When we later feel a little safer and open to our emotions  we find all this hurt there and it may seem shocking  like we're still stuck or getting worse  But you might find that if you allow yourself to feel whatever you need to feel  try not to feel shame because you have bad feelings  and treat your wounds like a child that needs soothing    this process may get easier  Does any of that help  even a little bit   I love the German culture too  I lived in Germany for five years when I was very young  and here in Canada I was a teacher at a German language school for several years  The language is so melodious to me  and I'm amused when others say they find it harsh  I think they've just seen too many Nazi movies     Good on you for making the decision  Best of luck Drawing is one of the hardest hobbies to feel satisfied with because it takes years to actually get good at and progress can feel slow which leads to frustration  I like drawing but it can be so stressful  I somewhat want to believe this    but it also feels like we are doing survivorship bias here  Overly concentrating on those few who made it without seeing those who struggled and didn't contribute for anything    Sorry  I didn't want to damage your idea  I still think it's a good thought  But I can't fully embrace it   I will try my hardest to become successful and overcome my disadvantages  I think that my pain is a part of my motivation Dont worry about others  Focus on what you want to achieve  Hope you reach your goals Oh that's awful  I'm so sorry  Losing a family member early is never easy Hey want to talk  Feel free to message me  I think we can help each other  I think of it as righteous vengeance  Well  to an onlooker it might seem silly but it really gives me the jollies   If they want to attack me  they should be prepared for the consequences   Edit  How is this harmful  That's AWESOME   I'm felling the same way  No friends   always alone  and playing video games  But the two of us can make it  just do what makes you happy and try to apply yourself to something at least  I know what I'm saying doesn't feel like words of encouragement  but maybe the bad things will come away and good will overflow  With just a couple of steps  I hope you feel better and get through this  I don't or ever smoked regularly  Last time I got paranoid and I could only wait for it to pass  Terrible experience  never again  I don't know  Maybe we're just different  But this seems a tad sadistic to me   Actually  I shouldn't be telling you what you can or cannot do  That's not my place  I just don't relish the idea of killing insects for the hell of it  I realized recently just how much of my music is either sad or negative or serious or dark or gloomy in some way  I used to have a lot more upbeat music but I guess somewhere along the way it started to become hard to listen to it  feeling bad then hearing the line     "I'm stupidly happy      Everything's fine      I'm stupidly happy      My heart pumping wine      I'm stupidly happy      With idiot grin      I'm stupidly happy      it's surely a sin "   just feels awful  And something about songs that are so obviously major key happy doesn't work either  I've been unintentionally gravitating strongly to slower  darker songs  Something about hearing     "The sides are steep the waters deep      From bank to brae the water's pouring      And your bonnie grey mare she sweats for fear      She stands to hear the water roaring       And woe betide you Annan Water      At nights you are a gloomy river       And over you I'll build a bridge      That never more true love may sever "   where you can  feel  the mournful  aching sadness of the words just clicks with me and feels 'right' when I listen to it  where the happy songs cause some kind of dissonance or discomfort   I'll be a friend matey  0  Sounds like more of an issue on their end to me  Wouldnt she be hurt by losing you too   I hope you know this isn't your fault You were

instead I'm glad you did  gives me a little drop of hope for humanity   I wouldn't say I kill them for fun  I kill torture them because they have the intention to hurt me  This might come as a surprise to you but I love insects in general  spiders too  reptiles    Fishes    Not so much for mammals  I wouldn't dream of hurting any of those mentioned above  but if they strike to kill  I should repay in kind  I tend to gravitate towards music thats  dark  angry  depressing  and or chaotic  That music resonates with me  and happy music makes me immeasurably sad and uncomfortable I hope somewhere deep inside you realize that these things don't have shit for brains  Do you really think they are out to try and hurt you  These little pests are living their lives  they don't even know what it means to be inflicting pain on others  This probably wont make you change your ways  cause depression turns people into hopeless  stubborn fucks  and trust me  I know  But hopefully you'll maybe learn to empathize a bit for these pesks  You're getting revenge on them for something they don't even realize they do  Take your anger out on something else  whatever it may be  just not something living  no matter how much you hate them  Hope you read this   You are not ugly  fat  gross  a slut or disgusting  Men use these words to control women  To make you feel that way  so you DON'T tell anyone  They want to bring your self worth down  Please  don't let them have that satisfaction   Seemingly yeah she was  But it's the best thing for their relationship  its not just any guy  it's just me  It's crazy how similar our stories are   I have mild OCD  anxiety  and depression  My OCD is much better on venlafaxine but my depression is still there  Let me know if you end up changing meds  I am desperately wanting to change up what I'm taking since I feel so out of it and just dull  I have the same condition but I faint randomly  Roughly 5 10 times it happens to me  I feel you  We can maybe talk here  or pm's  Do you feel like your depression is completely gone  How much venlafaxine are you taking  yes it happens to me less though it has so far only happened 3 times in my life i'm 11 by the way  in 6th grade now    I read all my comments   I understand that they have no concept of malice despite acting out like a bunch of tiny barbarians  doesn't change the fact that they are inflicting pain on me  Don't get me wrong  I don't mind the black ones biting me since they barely hurt at all  but the red ones can cause me to yell and wince when they bite   As for living things  I try to have empathy for them as long as they are friendly with me  I've had pets and I treat them like my babies  I wouldn't dream of hurting them  even if they bite me  But red ants you see  they swarm  they are territorial and they are in my way  I can't safely relocate them without them crawling up my hands and giving me a world of pain    But  I'd also say this  I don't value the life of any creature  perhaps only mine and my family for practical reasons  This is silly to say but those ants can either be my friends  be neutral  or suffer consequences  I feel like more people need to be open to talking about their negative traits  As a person with depression  I've had trouble in the past talking about things I hate about myself and if someone brings them up I'd just ask them not to talk about it  This led to a lifestyle where I was able to understand why I was unhappy  but unable to do anything about it as I didn't know how to change it or who to talk to  to change it   I'll give a personal anecdote for this  I've always been pretty awkward  I never really knew why  I just though that was how I was supposed to be and there was nothing I could do about it  The more I talked about how awkward I was  the less awkward I became  It shed new light on things I hadn't even considered before  it led to me understanding the root of my awkwardness and how to effectively combat it  It turned from me hating my awkwardness  to me embracing that I was awkward sometimes  but I could improve my social skills and become more outgoing   Introspection can only get you so far in the end  You really need to talk to someone to truly understand how you feel  as an outside opinion can often by the tipping point in the end to understanding yourself  It's a constant battle between having to want to get better and the depression  however when you start to improve your life in any way it can lead to you wanting to get help and not being content with just being nothing   I suppose first you need to understand what makes you unhappy about yourself and actively want to change that  You can't just want other people to fix your life  it won't happen  but they can really help you keep on track with self improvement  You have to do a lot of soul searching and introspective thought before you can even begin to understand yourself and I don't think I truly understand myself to this day  but I still know a lot more than I used to and I'm happy about that   This is a bit of a ramble  but I wanted to share because you seem like a nice  good person  We're all a little fucked up  but being able to confront our demons is how we better ourselves and you can only take on so many demons by yourself  Congratulations on staying sober for three months  It's a true accomplishment  even if there was a relapse  You seem like you can conquer if  if need be and if you need any help feel free to talk to me  Have a good day  I like to pretend my future self has life figured out  I live out fantasies about how successful I am and how well I handle situations  I have dreams like this as well  appreciate the concern but iv been getting drunk 2 much  cus i cant handle shit 5 more days  D  concern isnt the right word but appreciate the kind words but something i need to do probably not the best decision i will make but will be my last and will be mine  D ill leave one thing tho money for my famley they need it so thats something     Do you go to any therapist  I'm curious as to how this has manifested elsewhere in your life   I remember the dark days when I couldn't even do a single one  and now I can do 100  in a single sitting and 300  over the course of a day    I need to go through a period of psychologist and psychiatrists to get medication for this  Well I promised her that we would have a place to stay so she wouldn't have to drive home drunk or close to drunk  I'm trying to do a running streak this year   ultimate goal is running at least 1 mile everyday this year so 365 days of running  but I'm also setting lower goals because this is my first attempt and I may not get there so I'm running today  3 365   probably going for 3 4 miles

Post feedback in  r ToMetric"  Yes I do visit a therapist for depression and anxiety  I was also described as having difficulty working with others    Which I'd say I've outgrown the latter   What do you mean by 'how this has manifested elsewhere'  This makes me really happy  I don't know you at all but this makes me proud   Good luck  man   I hope it works out     I empathize with this  but what I will say is that these ants won't be friends with anyone  That doesn't give us a reason to break their limbs off one by one just for show  The mere concept of wanting to savagely massacre such insignificant beings kind of manifests a lack of human emotion  I'm not one to be telling people about having emotions  but if I were to become my ideal depression less self  it would be someone who knows how to control his barbaric side  especially on such trivial ants      That said  I know it's tough and I empathize because I assume you deal with these ants on a regular basis and I can imagine how irritating they could get  Take what I said above with a grain of salt  but maybe you could try and deal with them in less morbid ways  And I know it's really hard  especially with depression  so I'll leave it at this    Thank you  this is the kind of thing I was looking for   If that's what you want to do  then that might help you  Do you think that you will only feel better once you get medication  You've mentioned elsewhere that you find going to the psychologist psychiatrist a waste of time  why is that  What sort of support do you think would help you  and not be a waste of time  Most likely  it's a side effect  I used to take in the evening but had to stop due to muscle weakness and light headiness in the morning  I take it now at 19h max in order to not have morning sickness and muscle weakness  Good job going to see someone  that's really an admirable thing to do that I know I've even struggled with  You are never alone  there is always someone for you to talk to  whether someone on here or someone in person  Keep on pushing through  I am so sorry for your loss  My thoughts and prayers for your family  Perhaps you're right  I do what I do because I want to instill fear and establish dominance over them  but those little critters probably won't understand my intentions  That's not to say I didn't take joy in getting my revenge   Less morbid huh  Maybe a quick splat  or smack them half dead  That's kinda the thing though  I don't know what I want out of life  You can tell me to get out there and search for it  but it just doesn't work like that for me  Lots of people here are depressed cause they broke up  they lost a loved one  hate their job  etc  But I'm one of the people that literally don't understand their existence  I don't know why I'm even here  Gaming just makes life go by faster and there's no real passion or interest in reach  Even if I go to community college  what do I study  How will I even have the mental state to survive through more schooling  It's all just a blur to me  my future and my past  My present is just me wasting my life away   I don't live in America bro You are years ahead of Poland    Oh man  dude so heartbreaking  man I wish I could do something for you but I can't  I wish I was religious so I I could at least say a prayer for you but I can't even do that    dude this is not in any way your fault  this is life it's how life works  it's a fucking cunt  and that's just what it is    Please know that    from one internet stranger to another  much love mate  Kia Kaha  be strong  this post is everything  thank YOU LOOOLING Get proper medical health  Panic and anxiety attacks are easily solved with the right medication  That is one of those incredibly excruciating pains and suffering than can be actually very easily avoided just with a few meds for some time  But that kind of medication must be prescribed and controlled by a proper doctor  This is very important  Once that issue is solved you also should start looking until you find a therapist that suits yourself and can help you with the depression  Or smack them full dead  so they don't have to endure it  Do what you gotta do to get your job done  If you gotta kill em  kill em  Just don't let the barbaric side take control of yourself  That's my invitation to you   Sorry to hear about the stomach bug  Today was chest and shoulders for me  and it was a hell of a workout  I'm really pleased with my progress on the bench so far  It is quite astonishing really how much everyone who is depressed has in common with the symptoms of the illnesses  and as has been said  it's good to know you are not alone  and you are not  It is also good to know people like you and I are trying to understand and will beat it or make it become a minor annoyance at the least    Good day to you too Sir  Take Care   Fuck  fuck I think you're actually me  It's like being an untethered buoy in the middle of a tornado  beaten within an inch of your life but just  not  able  to sink  I have no one to grab my hand either  Only therapists who I pay to pretend to care  Once you've considered suicide  it's hard to come back from that place  It's hard not slip back into that headspace  I self medicate to sleep my life away also  Hoping for something to lift the grief off my heart because it's too heavy for me to lift and it's crushing me   The only reason I haven't done it is because I have this stupid fucking thing inside me that I hate deeply that clings to hope  I wish I could just do it  But that part of me just won't stop saying  'soon'  Soon it will be bearable  Soon there will be relief  and hope  I'm looking up from where I'm laying  on my back at the bottom of this god awful hole I've fallen down  been falling down for 20 years and there's no logical reason for me to see light at the top  but a little piece of me is saying there's a pinprick of sun up there and I can't ignore it  I wish I could  It would be so much easier to quit  It's like that cartoon that says   depressed people are the most hopeful people of all  A depressed person is like an unarmed soldier behind enemy lines surrounded by people trying to kill him with a trillion weapons and the soldier is crying out  "I'm outnumbered  but I can survive if someone just handed me a stick  just a stick and I would fight through every one of these men with guns  I just need one sign that someone is rooting for me against these awful odds and I will be okay  I'll manage  It's just me against a million but I'll be ok if I just had something to fight with" That is some crazy fucking optimism  It sounds insane  But it's how we are living our lives  in our minds  I wish I could find that cartoon  it says it better than I did  I'm just rambling at this point  I don't know what my point is  You're not alone  I'm rooting for you  I'm in the same situation  except we are both on different battlefields but we're fighting together  There's lots of us out there  Many of us only have our fists to fight with  fists against machine guns but we're still alive  That's a vicious  perverted kind of victory  but it's something  We have touched the limits  we have felt rock bottom and made our beds there  If we can do that then we make the long and bloody crawl back up to sunlight  just out of spite and defiance and the knowledge that we've climbed out of hell with half our limbs chopped off and our hearts shattered and we didn't fucking die  That is something  That's a stick I can grip on to       Edit  this is the cartoon

anything beyond my computer screen  and venturing out would be a nightmare  If I can barely squeeze through high school  how do I expect myself to live through life and develop a work ethic  I sound

still in that "wait    what day is it again " I agree with myceli yum that it would be important to get checked out by a doctor just in case  But if that does not lead to an insight  I would try a number of experiments if I were you  Try different exercises to see if the nausea occurs no matter what you do  for example what if you just go swimming for a change  Or go for a jog  Or even a walk  Try a much shorter and easier workout and see if you still get nauseous  Try it with a different trainer and without a trainer to see if it is something about your interaction with the trainer that leads to anxiety  Try working out on your own without anyone present  Also try to take the trainer's advice an increase your caloric intake significantly  and see whether that helps  Try different things and keep track of any times when you are not nauseous and figure out what could account for it  Once you find a way to work out without nausea  then you can start from that and see how much you can modify it to be more like your preferred workout but still without nausea  That's how I would approach it anyway  thanks for answering At least you have something you want  this is a blessing  Because the illness could be so bad  you don't even want anything    I used to be in your shoes  All I can say is use that desire to drive other changes  Maybe starting with looking at things from the bright side  Try to make little progress towards success  and change your belief that what you do is bad  My prayer is with you  around the same age as me  Acceptance is the first step of recovery  I am so glad you have reached this first step  Good luck to you and if you need to just vent it out  feel free to pm me  Sorry to hear that man definitely sucks this year so far but you got your whole life ahead of you to look forward to  Its what any mom would want for his son   Just over a year ago I split with my partner  she took my daughter and moved out  she let me stay in our home  that she owned  for a month while I looked for accommodation  I swear if she hadn't left me my dog I would have taken my life  I have to admit I didn't treat him how he deserved over that time  Sometimes he didn't eat  because I couldn't get out of bed  he didn't get all the walks he needed  because I was in bed crying  or on the couch crying  or on the floor crying    But god damn that good boy greeted me every day with a big face full of doggy saliva  and gave me unconditional love when it didn't come from anywhere else  He lives with my ex now  he's got a HUGE fenced in yard and all the toys in the world and my little girl to play with so I couldn't be happier for him  but Dougy  I want you to know I love you buddy  from the bottom of my heart   I wouldn't be here without you  I am still continuing the Core de Force workouts which are martial arts themed DVD workouts I got for Christmas  Today is supposed to be one I have not done yet called Agility Power  And because it is Tuesday  I will also go to folk dancing in the evening which I am eagerly awaiting  I resigned last week partly because my boss decided to record my time off to attend two medical appointments as 'lateness ' I mean a few hours  Despite medical certificates l couldn't switch shifts to attend a brain scan or see my psychiarist to get meds  I would tell a psychiatrist  This sounds like a few other disorders  Yes and no  Who we are a collection of our memories  We start wiping stuff out and we begin to lose ourselves  Humans learn from mistakes  If we forget our mistakes then we might unwittingly repeat them  Forgetting negative events in our lives could help us move forward  but there is a price to be paid   Ever watch the movie "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"  I was hoping there would be a silver bullet for this but that doesn't look to be the case   You've all given me a lot to mull over  I'll get back to you all after work  Thank you so much   Nausea is a pretty typical symptom for me but I definitely feel nauseous before I feel confusion or I start shaking   Has anyone had success with systematic desensitization on something like this  It's really worked well to get me into the gym and able to be around other people  I just don't know if the trigger is an internal physical sensation but I think if I lie down as you suggested  myceli yum  instead of just exit the situation the symptoms would at least stop worsening even if it's not a circulation issue  It's just that the nausea is so bad and the anxiety is kind of meh that I tend to just get home asap   Thanks again  all  I'm so sorry  Please don't give up hope  I was on it for 1 5 years and had no dreams  also lithium though   When l was coming off it l had dreams for a week  2 years ago  Did that 2 years ago  I will never return to it  Good idea though    I would go crazy if I had FB   It's cool to see someone else recommend that book and I'm happy shrinks are out recommending it  I constantly talk about it here and in real life   I've been talking about it for a decade because for me it was my "yes " moment  Good luck for you  I will also seek help this year  after years of battling with my inner voice  Thanks for sharing Call the police  Give me updates to ensure that you did  I wish you luck I smoked most days for about 10 years  from college to my late 20s  Most times when I took a break I would move to hypomania after a few days  which at the time was a great motivation to take a break  Of course  this was before I was diagnosed   My last binge was a couple of months after I was prescribed Wellbutrin  and when I stopped I came the closest to a full manic episode that I ever had   In retrospect  the prescription alone had already put me in hypo territory   After that I had my diagnosis and prescription changed  and started regular appointments with a pdoc   Now  I smoke on the rare occasion  a couple of times a year  and it is not a problem  Looking back  it certainly helped me cope before I got any professional help  and it certainly held me back from accomplishing a lot that I could have  including getting help   I never had the option of choosing strains  so I cannot say what effect that may have had   I really miss smoking weed  but I can honestly say my life is better now without it  dude congrats   I started with very little pushups too  now I can reach 40   5 months later  Now I fell in love with calethenics  I'm addicted to pushups because there are many variations of push ups  keep going   Here is how to progress if you cant do 1 push up   Warm up your wrists  important   and do negative push ups  If you dont know what that is  You put yourself in the push up position with arms straight and go down as slowly as possible    repeat until you can go down and then up afterwards  Yourself    your past    reality  Maybe it's time to confront whatever it is and work with it and not against it  This sounds like rape      If it were not rape you'd have described a feeling of honestly  wanting  to have sex with all of them  That is some people's kink  I'm sorry but as one woman to another I want you to understand the difference between not wanting to have sex with someone and regretting having sex with someone   I never wanted my boyfriend to take my virginity while fingering me at 16  but he never asked  I regret having sex with my coworker because now it's awkward and I wasn't over the moon about him so it ended quickly   You are absolutely NOT terrible  ugly  a slut or any of those things  Go to the police and be strong  then lawyer up   It's not that though care  it's that they don't know how to help you  Depression is one of those things YOU have to work on  Other people can't solve this because they will never fully understand what the problem is because you probably don't understand it all yourself  If you just need someone to hear it  tell your friend or mom to just listen and not speak  Get it out  I guess it's hard because with whatever mental illness I have  still learning about it    had for about 2 years at a degree in which I am dysfunctional  I have been unable to function   let alone move forward   Previous to that  I graduated high school with honors  went to junior college and after doing incredibly well there  was accepted to my dream university and graduated there with honors    It absolutely blows my mind how much I have changed since then  I cannot even imagine the energy I had and how much I got accomplished every day  And I was functional    I was normal  Now my brain chemistry is fucked  So sure  it is comparing myself to others     But it is more because I feel as though I am being left behind  I want to move on to the next stage in my life  and I am getting much older too boot  where the hell did this come from    too boot lol         and feel absolutely and entirely  stuck     Stuck  in that I cannot even keep my living space anything less than disgusting and trashed   Stuck  in that I go through periods of time that I  cannot for the life of me prevent  in which I become antisocial  cease all physical activity  creativity  basic work     I can't deal with stress  Make bad decisions  Pick my face bloody  And I  don't  want this  I am sincerely trying  But something is wrong  and   yea      All the best brother   Gosh  you make a good point   You say you  used  to be in my shoes      I suppose you can venture to guess what I am going to ask now   How did you get out of these shit shoes  Why is this past tense for you    And thank you so very much  I would like to believe in a higher power someday  No  you won't ever get over it  Go to PTSD program because those programs are there to help you cope with your experiences  We all believe in you and support you here  Go get yourself some well deserved help  Not only does it take years to get good  but your eyes get better faster than your hands  So  while what you draw now might be good enough to past you  your current perspective sees so many more problems  ok so I dont know what day of the week it is     Please don't  Stay with us  Call a Hotline   Talk to us   Almost everybody here is saying the wrong thing Drawing isn't about perfecting a skill You must sit down and approach drawing valulelessly Never chuckk anyting you have ever done  drawing is just a bunch of lines right  Nothing can be better or worse they are are only what they are I guess that might be a small shame in drawing in a style that is the same as everyone else's  even tho most people would take a large pride in that if it was considered a style of high value like realism or something  But if you adopt this valueless style and just try and draw as fuck as much as you can then after a while or so you will develop something independent or that feels a reflection of yourself possibly But still you must follow the valueless rules  and just draw the first thing that comes into your head  don't worry about what to draw Because otherwise what's the point  right  I'm really sorry  Please don't lose patience  That's what my father always says  Don't lose patience  Don't break down   Wasn't you're fault  Stay strong and take care of your family  Cry if you want  do anything but do not give up  Do not do that   Just keep at it  Don't let yourself stop improving because of doubts or a rough time  Like when you feel worse then usual  take some time for yourself  Take a relaxing bath  watch one of your favorite movies  take a walk it is ok to avoid people if you want   I do   eat something yummy  eta   Important things Sleep   not enough can make it worse Maybe you need more then average because during sleep you work through some of your emotions   Exercise  It releases the good neurotransmitters in your brain Also proven to be very effective in helping with depression   Get Sun Vitamin D is needed "Unexplained fatigue" and "difficulty thinking clearly" are some symptoms caused by  lack of Vitamin D  https   en m wikipedia org wiki Vitamin D deficiency    Eat   Eat well A bad diet can affect everything   I've been where you are my friend  Things will get better  When I used to feel that way I play some uplifting music and do some Hobbies that make me happy  I always try to remember tomorrow is a new day where I can do better than today  It helps an I hope it can help you     "aren't we all a little depressed "  Maybe they're clinically depressed too and in denial   Dysthimia is a mild but persistent depression  It may not cripple a person but it's still a poor way to live  What's worse is that SSRIs don't appear to do much for mild depression  Do barbarians do that   Invitation  been sick for 10 days   picked up the virus from hell at the hospital when my mom was admitted  she's out now   the plan is to either do bodyweight exercises at lunch or swim  we'll see  That's very sad that your parents do not believe your depression is real  Well  I believe you  and I don't think you are acting badly through being depressed  It means that you are hurting and that you have needs which aren't being met  and people need to care for you and respect you  Your parents are probably unable to empathize because when they were younger  their parents  or other adults  didn't empathize with them  That would explain their behaviour and maybe help you to feel compassion for them  but know that it's also okay to be angry at them    What exactly is the bedroom situation  I said it was waste of time since I have still go through many many times before I get any medications  It fucking sucks to buildup a courage to get a time for one and only to be told "we will have to take further meetings   "  I second what was already told  I suffer from depression and anxiety too and had panic attacks before  I always have with me a bottle of a mild anti anxiety med that was prescribed from my doctor and it saved me a lot of times  best course of action is to inform your doctor and see what can be done about it  Wish you luck   3 SNAFU  situation normal  all fucked up   I don't have any motivation for anything anymore  not for even the most basic things  Anyway  I'm going to bed soon  and I just want to say again that whether you feel good  bad  or ugly  I care about you and am here to talk to you  in public or in private  For now I wish you    onnea   good luck   It is my belief that we can heal from any disease  mental or physical  and live in utopia  But life can be a huge struggle too  What you've said about how your family treats you sounds devastating  and again  it is very much understandable that you'd want to do whatever you can to end the pain  I hope your parents will understand how much they are hurting you and that they will want to figure out how to communicate kindly with you  In the meantime keep doing whatever brings you peace  whether that's playing a game  reading  going for a walk  sleeping  and try to be gentle with yourself whenever you are suffering  You're not just faking  you're a good person  and you deserve to be loved completely  always  Take care     I don't agree with the "women live on easy mode" thing  but using a joke as an argument is idiotic as the thing op said  This isn't even true  just look the statistics  On a personal level  I am able to put up with humans  but I hate humans as a collective  I love my late hamster very much     My heart aches for you  man    My condolences to you and your family    I guess the best advice I could give you is to be there as much as you possibly can for your father and sister    Be sure to go through your grieving process  get through it however you can but be sure to cherish the life your mother gave you  she'd want you to be happy no matter what   It is NOT your fault  It will NEVER be your fault  Please  please  please do not feel guilty  It will only make you feel worse  It is shocking what has happened and it seems surreal losing a parent like that  I wish you the best  the next couple of months will probably be harder as you adjust  But never stop  Keep going  Deep breathe  exhale  clear your mind  you've got your whole life to live  Keep going for her   Hey  I've been taking 200mg of sertraline a day for 9 years  It takes a little while to work  but it makes a huge difference  Good luck  stay positive I love it  as long as its done with moderation  Flaming around on reddit is quite entertaining   You should try it out  I also want to help you  if you want to talk you can send me a pm  Agreed  it's a hell yes from me  I read many books about cognitive behavioral therapy and law of attraction  Collectively this led me to make the decision that  1  I am not a victim of my condition and I will get out of it  I take 100  responsibility for my thoughts and actions   2  I change my thinking habit bit by bit from negative to positive   Making decision means you really decide to do everything you can control for change  I would like to give you a magic trick but there was none  I just made a decision and start to change  You can do this in the next minute  And if you can flip that switch once  you can do it again and again  Next thing you know  you are normal  Btw  I am new to Reddit and need karma to post a question  If my answers help you  please upvote       If you have more questions feel free to ask  Yes  I've had these thoughts too    A lot of it always goes back to the government for me  They are trying to poison me and everyone else and downplay our abilities    And the Truman show is just a mind fuck  Lolol   Can so relate  I'm too busy living in my imaginary world to participate in reality  It's hard  Sometimes even think why go outside and do something when my fantasy will always be 10x better  To make my point more clear I will give you an example of taking responsibilities for my thoughts and actions and change them bit by bit   Suppose you caught yourself thinking  I am depressed therefore I cannot be successful  my brain is messed up   You will then take a piece of paper and write down the thoughts  Then you will write a counter thought  For example  write "If I want to be successful I have to stop entertaining this belief that I cannot be successful because my brain is messed up  People with that type of beliefs cannot be successful  In fact  I believe that although I have not figured it all out yet  there's a way for me to become better  To have better attitude  To love myself again  And if I keep changing my thoughts deliberately  I will build the necessary mental habits  I will be alright "   At first  it's like forcing yourself to write down things you don't believe in  but over time  trust me  the positive thoughts will become your new normal  i am in the exact same situation  even 10 years  you know that corny cliche saying   when one door closes  another opens   but were too stuck looking at the closed door    i think that applies in this case  baby steps  This is one of the ones I'm having a harder time getting over  Where I think our mental illness is actually a strength of some form  Or something completely different than an illness  and more of an unlocked special ability    Really really glad this post helped you   3 I really hope it works but I also hope you don't get your hopes up to much on the first try  It can take several weeks to find the right dosage and maybe the right combination of drugs  Good luck though I hope you find what you need   3 Whatever you do  don't mess with your dosage   stick to it for the next 2 months diligently   FYI  From the national alliance on mental illness   "Sleep  energy  or appetite may show some improvement within the first 1 2 weeks  Improvement in these physical symptoms can be an important early signal that the medication is working  Depressed mood and lack of interest in activities may need up to 6 8 weeks to fully improve " Same here  I managed to clean up somewhere from August through to November  But December has been a massive come down  So here I go again  I need something I can stick with which always keeps me going  I already exercise sleep well and eat well  but I need that extra belief in something that'll move me onto the next level of living and experience  It's a mix of being envious of them and feeling that they are empty for finding happiness in such average things  Hope you feel better soon   Today I'll be swimming 3k and then going to my first martial arts class in years  I'm excited  Deepest condolences on your terrible loss  I know it's hard to do  but try to be kind to yourself right now  Allow yourself time to grieve in your own way  Take care  Again  I am sorry for your loss  I'm getting back into jump rope this year  I haven't done it in at least 4 years and yesterday  Monday  I had my first session to re familiarize myself with it  Boy  I had completely forgotten how demanding it is   For Wednesday the plan is to lift weights at home but depending on how things go I may go for a run instead  My anxiety was triggered this evening and it has me worried for my future  I've sent my therapist a message to schedule an appointment  I hope he's back in town  but if the anxiety wave doesn't subside by tomorrow running will be easier for me to get into that weights   Backup plans    Oh man  I can't begin to imagine how you're feeling right now  We had a similar situation some two years ago  my mom had a blood sugar level of nearly 800  but she survived  However  I was too much in shock when I heard about it  to call  visit or even talk to her after she was back home  To this day I keep hating myself for doing so  BUT I believe she understands  And I believe  no I'm sure  your mom understands too  wherever she is right now  Noone ever imagines such a situation  and if it's there  it's all too quickly for you to react  Please  don't give yourself any fault in this  and rest assured your mom is not mad at you or anything  She's still loving you the same  and will be very proud of every little achievment you accomplish in your life  I'm so sorry you have to go throufh that  A friend of mine attempted suicide  but he fortunately didn't succeed  You may also want to visit  r SuicideBereavement   I find that dogs are even better They love you so unconditionally  have you tried switch meds or upping the dose  I repeat  THIS IS NOT YOUR FAULT  It's normal to feel like you do  but please please please understand it is not your fault in anyway  Go and tell someone   Jacqueline is right  practice is key  I could barely play in tune when I started  I've known people with dyspraxia learn to play guitar  even helped teach one or two  not that I'm a magical teacher who knows everything about guitar    Start with power chords and slower songs then pick up the pace over time  incidently metal core with all its 1s and 0s can be an okay place to start    I'm prescribed Wellbutrin SR 150mg  Setinin 25mg  and Lamictal 25mg  When I take any type of medication  I usually don't experience drowsiness but these make me tired  Really tired  I'm supposed to take the last 2 at bedtime but that shit makes my body so tired  I can't even describe it  Like my mind is awake and active but my body becomes progressively number and number it becomes incredibly frustrating  I can't go to sleep at all when I experience this  I despise taking meds so I think that's affecting it's effects on my progress   Several other people are saying the same  And even if she's telling the truth  no  especially then  she should be advised to seek help from trustworthy adults and or the police  Letting her post here for hours while any potential evidence of the crime is decaying isn't doing anyone any favors  Especially not the next victim of those guys  Same  I can't think of anything that would satisfy me  which I could live off of   With that said  it's not like I know for sure things won't get better  It would have been easier if I was never born  but since I'm born anyway I think it's better to live on even if it sucks because things might get better and it would really be a mistake to not go further by killing yourself  I mean  some people are living a happy life right  I'm sure there is a way somehow for us too to live a happy life  we just haven't found it yet  Kind of funny story I want to add on here about what helped me realize my delusions  and what delusions actually are    So  when I went to the doctor to get on my meds I was talking to my psych and I was saying  'I have delusions  My delusion is that I think every person in my life at some point hates me  My mom  my boyfriend  my friends  everyone doesn't want me in their life '   And he said  ' Those are not delusions  Delusions are things that are out of possibility  Something like the government is following you  aliens  conspiracy theories  alternate realities  Those are delusions  Everyone not liking you is a real possibility'   And I know I sat there with the blankest look on my face after that because 1  He just told me everyone very well may not like me    Which is actually true because of the path of self destruction I continue to go on in my ups and downs  I do things to make people not like me sometimes   But obviously that didn't really settle well with me upon impact  So 2  I'm sitting there like  'Well this guy is brainwashed idiot '   It took SO LONG for me to start thinking      Maybe I should think about that some more  Lol  Like I say it's still very much an issue  but I'm on my meds and working through it  And maybe my psych's definition can help someone else out there  Love you guys  And Happy 2017   3  Hey  I imagine you're getting enough 'I can't imagine how you're feeling's and 'remember it's not your fault's  so I'll just send my love and most positive thoughts I can muster in your general direction  I hope you all have the strength to keep each other going  and even if we're just a bunch of faceless usernames on the internet  we still care a ton about you  Hang in there friend     Well  any suggestions   Seriously   I'm completely lost in every direction    This is the closest thing I can afford to therapy    So  I figured I had nothing left to lose    Also I appreciate you taking the time to read everything   I'm so sorry to hear that  sending my love your way  I hope you manage to stay as strong as is reasonable given the circumstances  And thank you for your words as well  honestly  I find it so easy to worry about the state of my life and what I'm doing and how I'm not improving  but I guess it is important to just   exist  even if I can't do anything else  Just hang in there bud  hopefully tomorrow will be an up day for you  You're really going to throw your life away for a girl    think with your head  not with your heart  It takes 2 weeks on average for most anti depressants to build up enough in your system to start working  Keep at it  even when it feels like it isn't working  You should start to see some improvement after 2 1 2 weeks  I can't wait for the day when we can send physical hugs over the internet  but for now a virtual one will have to suffice             Thinking of you  hope you're doing okay    Please do discuss it with your therapist   There are lots of different meds available and hopefully you can find something that works for you  Call the police first  I know this sounds like a very standard response  and I understand if it annoys you to hear it  but have you seen a therapist psychologist  I say this not because it's a default suggestion for mental illness  but because I think it can actually help with working through where this stuff is coming from and how you can change it  I've found myself more interested in super violent and gory films and videos recently  and talking through why I'm drawn to these things and what I feel it gives me with someone professional I hope is helping me to address whatever it is in my mind that's underlying this I was a way chronic smoker as a teen  also drugs  First psychotic episode at 22   it was bad  I didn't feel like myself for almost two years when I gradually started smoking weed again  It definitely led to my next psychotic episode  hospitalized 3 months  No weed for 20 years  functioned ok  Started smoking  felt weird at first  bad reactions  but kept smoking  after a year  another severe psychotic episode   bad  I'm positive weed led to these  2 bad psychotic episodes for me  I learned my lesson and won't smoke ever again  I'm on disability for life  Every psychotic episode does something to your brain  makes bipolar worse  I can't have another one   I wish I never started weed or drugs  I'm sure my bipolar wasn't helped by it   BTW this comes up a lot  I recommend using the search feature  May I ask why you are switching  Because it took so long for me to get diagnosed I can honestly say without marijuana I don't know where I would be today  I understand where it can make some peoples paranoia way worse  but I've learned to deal with the paranoia because I know it's only because I just smoked  And even if I do get paranoid when it goes away Im calm and it does what I need  And it's really is all about the strains too  Sativa strains are great during depression when you need to get up and start doing something  Indica strains are great when Im all manicy and need eat  go to sleep  and need to chill    I'm starting my medication now though and hoping that I might be able to ween off once I'm not going up and down so rapidly anymore    Really do love it though  Wish they would legalize it and do more studies on it   Actually  one of the things I hate most is when people say "Just get rid of those thoughts  be happy" and then just ignore real problems or make them worse   Thanks for sharing this  it actually helps when people show empathy  is because of people like you that I don't give up  there's a world worth fighting for  not all are assholes    it did nothing much for me it felt kinda chill but boring chill  I was on wellbutrin and it didn't do anything for me  I'm also on lamictal  which is my life saver  it has truly changed my life and has helped with my moods You can try writing to make your characters come alive  I've been doing that for some time and it's helping to distract me from life even though I suck at writing lol Hmmm  I wanted an IUD again and my GYN said skyla is easier less painful and he prefers the for women who haven't had children  I didn't have a very good time getting Morena inserted so it sounds nicer I suppose   The mirena was inserted in    2010  2011   I have been on the pill since I had the mirena out and I'm not a fan of it  tbh   I had the mirena out because it was almost time and I was getting cysts that were benign but painful  I think the skyla is also lower hormones  don't quote me   which should help the cysts    Hmmm  I wanted an IUD again

for me in the first place  I have a good cup of coffee or tea  I read  listen to music  maybe watch an upbeat show or movie  I make plans and goals   Sometimes it helps just to remind yourself of where you are  and what you have   Chances are you're better off than most of the rest of the world's citizens   Sometimes just being thankful you got through another day without being a "statistic " Yeah  Since 2012 I don't go out much  I'll go out when I need food or quick stops to pick up something I purchased but if it can be avoided I'd rather not  Not really convinced that I'm missing out on much with the way the world is these days  Scary to even drive in my city anymore with how crazy people are  I'd probably go out a lot more if I could afford to live somewhere I'd like to live   Yeah  I do think it is lower in hormones  But it also lasts less long and is less likely to stop your period  My gyn was all "um    I am supposed to tell you to get skyla since you've never been pregnant    but    personally I think that's a bunch of crap and I insert mirena for women who have never been pregnant all the time " I agree with this comment  You never know when your hypomania could turn into full blown mania too  So just make sure your talking to your psych about it    And yes  I'm triggered by movies  television  youtube  news articles  pretty much everything  Worst one is youtube for me  Lol Sorry you're hurting  The fact that she's dating somebody else already makes me think this has less to do with your shortcomings and you're blaming yourself too much  Obviously she's too afraid to ever be alone and show some respect to the marriage that isn't even officially over yet if she has to be with somebody else already  So gross when people do that    Realized I misread your post at first and having a son taken from you was a previous situation  not this one  Sounds like you could also benefit from committing to spending a few years single and worrying about getting yourself feeling better before you find yourself in another relationship    Read about No Contact and why that's the best thing for you right now  If it's over it's over  Communicate with her only as much as you need to in order to get the divorce over with  Don't keep tabs on whatever else she is up to with social media or anything else  Are there children from this relationship  If not  make it a clean break with as little drama as possible   As far as how to feel better  it's all too fresh now  but you'll get there  You'll get there faster by doing No Contact and getting the situation sorted out as quickly as possible  Treat it as a business deal that needs to be done  don't get emotional or share any feelings with her  There's nothing to be salvaged in a situation where she's already dating somebody else   It's not a case of it being hard to win as it is the crime being hard to prove unless there's sufficient evidence   The system isn't in place to screw victims over but to be as fair as possible and sadly rape is hard to prove unless there's DNA evidence and or witness' or recorded evidence or other such open and examinable things to show beyond a reasonable doubt the accused is guilty   fan  It's great that you have a process that works for you though  Setting a minimum is a great way to challenge yourself of the days where its extra difficult  The point is you're sticking with it   Very nice  I agree with the sentiment  Most times trying to remain calm and peaceful and letting the crazy world go on around me is enough to keep me going  but sometimes the darkness still manages to creep in   It's the best series I'll ever see   You should really consider watching it Good luck   I refuse to believe that  Thats depression talking  Impressive list of things you've already tried  but then to get to the end and see your awareness that you don't like the path you're on and don't care to finish the 7 months of classes you have left  I would imagine that might be why all those other things didn't work  Diet and exercise might improve the mood of somebody who is just generally down in the dumps  but has little to with realizing you don't like the path that you're on  Simplest solutions are usually the best  You don't like where you're going  so aim elsewhere  Doesn't sound good to me trying to medicate yourself into wanting something that you don't want  Beyond that  I don't know how to address the lack of motivation to make the changes  That is something I struggle with too  I do things on a daily basis that I know aren't taking me where I want to go   Always something I have struggled with  When you have very few friends from the start  it's easy to keep forgiving bad behavior when you feel like it's either bad friends or no friends at all  But obviously there's no point in keeping something in our lives once it has a larger negative effect than a positive one  so you just have to try to gauge that somehow   If someone is hurting your feelings or disappointing you more often than they bring any light into your life  it might be time to let that go   As far as what to do about it  sometimes nothing is best  You don't really have to make it a grand official gesture and tell them that the friendship is over  If they've been a crappy friend in the first place  chances are if you just distance yourself and talk to them less they probably won't even notice you're gone for a while  Unless you definitely want the certainty and closure of knowing that bridge is burned for good  then you could tell them or message them somehow and tell them why you feel the way you do and what you've decided to do about it   Of course the middle ground in there somewhere is that you could try to tell them how they hurt you and see if the relationship can be salvaged somehow  but that depends on if you think they're the type of person who will give two shits to listen to what you have to say   Getting out into nature  Which is hard to do since it requires time and effort  Hiking some trails or going to sit by a river has never failed to make me feel better  Kind of a limited option during the colder months   In those times  just remember  you are loved and important to somebody  Even if you don't know it  Your small talk or conversion with your local grocer could be the highlight of their day and the thing they look forward to in their job   You have an impact on more people than you think and there is nothing wrong with reaching out to others when you are weathered by the hardships of life   Hang in there mate and I wish your aspirations and dreams come to fruition in 2017  I've been trying to do this as well by speaking positivity into existence  I tell myself daily I'll have a great day and won't let anything get me down  So far  my mood has been better    Best of luck on your journey  friend   Sounds like he's living a pretty awesome life for a bachelor  but yeah that's a bit strange for a married man  But depending on your age it's not really your place to say anything  If you're living with them or they pay for things  you have even less of a platform to stand on    It's not really up to you to try to figure out what label or disorder you want to apply to him  Saying you want a surefire way to resolve your issues with him once and for all  this isn't really the way to go about it  As you alluded to  him having a willingness to attend therapy or something like that would probably benefit everyone  but if he won't he won't  Nobody on Reddit should read a few paragraphs from you and be able to say "yup  he's depressed"  Any number of things could be going on  If he's successful enough that he's bringing in money while living that lifestyle  well damn  good for him  I'd probably tell people to leave me the hell alone too if I could get away with living like that   Ultimately the person more in a position to be trying to figure out what's going on here is your mom  It's her husband and she should want to figure it out of it's making the entire family unhappy  Your only choice is get along in whatever way makes that possible  If he's that wrapped up in his computer all day  go about your own business  worry about having a good relationship with your mom  and keep things short and sweet when you see him  I guess  They'll always have that trump card that if you complain about things too much  to tell you that you just shouldn't be living there then    Relationships are 2 way streets  There's no way you can aim to repair this all by yourself  He'd have to want a better relationship with his family as well  All you could do is maybe write him a letter or something and tell him how this troubles you and how much you'd like to have a better relationship  as much as he doesn't exactly sound approachable about something like that  and then it's out of your hands   are you envious of their ability to find happiness in average things  honestly i wish i could give you advice  i wish i could tell you to just run away from all of this and start over  but i dont know if that's possible   or is it  http   well blogs nytimes com 2010 06 16 exploring the links between depression and weight gain  I completely relate  Everything appears to be great on paper but all I can seem to think about is being let go or replaced  I still need to figure out how to explain my diagnosis to HR but my fear of it being too late to disclose is pushing me in the direction of a talk with my therapist about it soon    Keep being awesome at work and sorry for the fear  You're not alone  I remember losing my Dad four years a go  It was just before Christmas  He was ill for a long time but we had convinced ourselves he would get better  I had the same reaction as you  I was in utter shock but knew I had to keep it together for my family  I feel for you and hope you have the strength to soldier onwards  We all know we have a limited time here and that's why we need to make the most of it  Please don't let it defeat you  instead use it as an energy to fuel your way through life   maybe you're right  Thanks very much  Interesting read     honestly same escaping depression  i think  its a long  arduous journey but seeing my gf complete it inspires me to keep pushing too Ouch   I wrote this a few minutes ago to somebody else  But I think it may apply to you as well        In these times  just remember  you are loved and important to somebody  Even if you don't know it  Your small talk or conversion with your local grocer could be the highlight of their day and the thing they look forward to in their job   You have an impact on more people than you think and there is nothing wrong with reaching out to others when you are weathered by the hardships of life   Hang in there mate and I wish your aspirations and dreams come to fruition in 2017          If you ever want to talk  just hit me up  I am slowly working through my own problems and have been battling depression for some years now   I am only 25  so I don't have much in the way of life experience and may not be able to provide you with the advice needed or what you want  but I'm objective to your situation and I am happy to help in whatever I can  even if you just need to vent or talk to somebody  Currently on 100mg of sertraline  don't give up hope if it takes a while to work  Pay attention to how you feel while on it  side effects can happen  shouldn't be major though   Also  at least for me  do NOT forget to take it when you get in the habit of taking it daily  When I forget a day  I get this buzzy like dizzy feeling  and get extremely nauseous  Good luck  Oh please  as long as there is another person on this planet she'd take them over me  i could probably draw anything with enough references but i wouldnt draw it good  that's for sure   if youre determined  my submitted history has some various art things submitted to subreddits Hey fuckface  you still around  heyyy that's one more gf than I've ever had  Audiobooks  I think most libraries can loan out audiobooks now   Damn  that's impressive  I've always wanted to write but just haven't gotten around to it  Sounds to me like you've worked your way through a good chunk of this journey and maybe you're just too caught up in wanting this to be the end already when you aren't quite there  You have the insight to be able to list the improvements you've made and also the things that you know you haven't tackled yet  At least having that information gives you an advantage compared to somebody who might be feeling down but can't pinpoint why    You're two days into dropping another bad habit  you say you're still uncovering and working through some abuse experiences  you know you have room to improve in diet and exercise   As they say  you have to try to appreciate the journey and not just yearn for the destination  No  I don't think where you are now is "as good as it gets"  I think you are well on your way to it continuing to get better and better  But in life there probably never is a distinguishable end zone  aside from the grave  Don't look at this as some end point that you're trying to get to  You'll be on this journey for the rest of your life  You have a pretty long list of things you've already improved and it sounds like your mind tends to downplay those things and instead focus on whatever else hasn't happened yet    I've dealt  still dealing  with narcissism in my family and sadly pretty much understand it'll be an emotional scar for life  It is hard to connect with other people when you know they can't ever understand what it was like    Getting the blood work done was a really smart idea as many people never make the connection that there can be something physically wrong that contributes to moods and mental states  Getting any information back about any deficiencies you might have is just one more big step you're taking that will continue to make things better    I think you're doing awesome  Sounds like you just have that all too familiar negative attitude that comes from having lived in the shadow of a narcissist    I really need to get to work on watching what I eat and getting back to exercise  As expected  it's January 3rd and I still haven't gotten started  You're not the only one not looking forward to making those changes  I'll see if I can make an effort today  maybe you can too  Even if it's just going for a walk  A lot of times getting your heart rate up and getting some oxygen to your brain is a huge boost for mood   It's different for me  I see a lone person  and I immediately get curious about them  The quiet ones are often the most brightest  But I get scared that they might not want someone prying into their lives  And the other thing  what if they get dependent on me  I won't be able to handle that  I don't cling  I don't want anyone to cling to me either  But just that feeling of having people to back you  while you back them as well  Sometimes  rarely  I do end up making small talk  hoping  that if they are interested  maybe they'll ask me a question or two  back as well   I need them   But nobody will give them to me   Cutting myself helps though so that's the only thing I can do right now  You need to do what you believe is best for yourself  If that means a ptsd program  fantastic  If it means having your parents turned over to the authorities  so be it  Do whatever you think will help you  That being said  look into every option  Examine the pros and cons  I'm sorry that you are suffering and I hope you press on and prevail through this situation  Good luck  god i hate having such a brilliant idea in my head trapped in a prison that my hands cant unlock  its so deeply frustrating I'm from Canada  P but seriously  don't worry about finding the dream job and then everything is solved  There are always problems  It's okay to have a job that sucks with decent coworkers that puts food in your mouth and to live for your hobbies   I was going through something like this yesterday  but I don't know how I snapped out of it  Sometimes I'm sure that my own depression is linked to my diet  the more I eat a balanced diet the better ability that I have to get out of the fog  I appreciate your post and I thank you for sharing such  I'm glad you were able to feel better  even if momentarily  If I had this advice when I was young   I wouldn't feel this depression I have  I would be racing away to escape this broken lie of a society and live my life as full as it can be     With all its sham  drudgery  and broken dreams  it is still a beautiful world   It is a beautiful world and I can't deny this beautiful piece of literature made me remember why it can be beautiful  That said  I pity the children human society molds and breaks them into something they'd rather not be   Of course they will say that  they are trying to watch out for themselves  I have tried my friend   been off of them for a month now but no luck  Why will no one give them to you   It's always been one of my favourites  I watched it again recently for the first time in a while and cried like a baby  It's a really beautiful story  Sorry that your friend never took the hint though    Thank you  That is really helpful  I DO get hung up on the destination  And I DO get hung up in negative thinking  Mostly I think everyone is better than me  Especially all women  I need to recognize these as toxic thoughts that are not true  I really appreciate your support      Your school may have a person you can speak to there   I have been there  i left half way through year 11  goes to year 12 before uni here in aus   Anyway  go see a psychologist or psychiatrist if you can  tell your parents how you really feel  it is hard but it may assist if they don't want to take you for whatever reason   I regret dropping out  but it was the best thing for me at the time   Seriously  talk to somebody at school if they have a somebody there for students  But honestly it would be best to see somebody outside of school   I am sorry you are stuck in this shitty cycle and as much as i can say it will get better  I understand that it is today that sucks  Speak to your mum and dad  not about leaving  but about seeing somebody to help you through this that is objective not subjective   Your mum and dad are subjective because of your relationship with them  Be open and honest  if you really need to then mention you are contemplating taking your own life if that is what it takes for them to take you seriously   I will check in in 9 10 hours to see how you're going if that's cool with you     I lost my father the day after his anniversary last year  7 months ago now   edit  to cancer  so it was not entirely unexpected   I know it feels terrible  like you're drowning and you can't seem to figure out what you can do to catch a breath  and that's okay  It's natural to be overwhelmed right now  and if you could somehow stop feeling that way  you're just kicking the can down the road    You may have lost your mother  but you've still got a father and sister who love you very much  You're all going to need each other in the coming months  and as hard as it can be sometimes due to how we process grief  remember to try your best not to push them away  Be open and honest about how you are feeling and encourage them to do the same    I subscribed to this sub a long time ago when things were much worse for me  and I mostly avoid posting because I've gotten better over the years  which I mention now because it's important to realize the effect that surrounding yourself with other crushingly depressed people can have on you  Seek out positive elements and do your best to make them a part of your life  now more than ever  Try to smile on a daily basis   even if everything seems wrong  there's always something to look forward to  so set your sights on that  pick yourself up  and keep moving  If you remain static you run the risk of becoming paralyzed by your grief and your fears    Finally  a bit about grieving that I am going to shamelessly steal from another  much older and wiser  redditor     u GSnow   Alright  here goes  I'm old  What that means is that I've survived  so far  and a lot of people I've known and loved did not  I've lost friends  best friends  acquaintances  co workers  grandparents  mom  relatives  teachers  mentors  students  neighbors  and a host of other folks  I have no children  and I can't imagine the pain it must be to lose a child  But here's my two cents    I wish I could say you get used to people dying  I never did  I don't want to  It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies  no matter the circumstances  But I don't want it to "not matter"  I don't want it to be something that just passes  My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person  And if the scar is deep  so was the love  So be it  Scars are a testament to life  Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut  or even gouged  and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love  And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was  Scars are a testament to life  Scars are only ugly to people who can't see    As for grief  you'll find it comes in waves  When the ship is first wrecked  you're drowning  with wreckage all around you  Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was  and is no more  And all you can do is float  You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while  Maybe it's some physical thing  Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph  Maybe it's a person who is also floating  For a while  all you can do is float  Stay alive    In the beginning  the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy  They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath  All you can do is hang on and float  After a while  maybe weeks  maybe months  you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall  but they come further apart  When they come  they still crash all over you and wipe you out  But in between  you can breathe  you can function  You never know what's going to trigger the grief  It might be a song  a picture  a street intersection  the smell of a cup of coffee  It can be just about anything   and the wave comes crashing  But in between waves  there is life     Somewhere down the line  and it's different for everybody  you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall  Or 50 feet tall  And while they still come  they come further apart  You can see them coming  An anniversary  a birthday  or Christmas  or landing at O'Hare  You can see it coming  for the most part  and prepare yourself  And when it washes over you  you know that somehow you will  again  come out the other side  Soaking wet  sputtering  still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage  but you'll come out     Take it from an old guy  The waves never stop coming  and somehow you don't really want them to  But you learn that you'll survive them  And other waves will come  And you'll survive them too  If you're lucky  you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves  And lots of shipwrecks      I seriously just panicked that I'm a day late returning to work    Made me euphorically manic and had me discussing sheep with anyone who would listen for some reason    but it didn't trigger it for long  only smoked the one night   Effects may depend on strain and dose and susceptibility so use with caution   Starting off anything you're going to be the worst at it  You're the one with the least experience of course    I was an absolute shitty athlete  but if you work hard you don't have t be good for people t respect you  I was terrifible  The worst player in the league  and my team still encouraged me to get better and I was an all around liked guy    Don't give up  you'll get better   It is not your fault  What they did is criminal  Love and best wishes your way  3  3  3  You can do it   hugs  And that fantastic  fuzzy feeling you get when they eventually die  from an accident or age  Came here to say this  Also you might have to to try a couple different medications before you find the right one  so if you're not getting better  having side effects  etc  tell your doctor   Congrats      "Too many have had bad side effects"  So I can't get anything anymore  The burden of depression is hard to carry  especially when everybody wants you to pretend you're fine when you're not   I hope you can shed this burden or at least lighten the load you carry by yourself each day   There is no shame in reaching out if you ever need to  I hope your depression is gone or at least eases this year   Remember life has highs and lows  depression mutes the highs and amplifies the lows  but you are important and loved  I vividly remember the morning in 1997 when  after 4 weeks on an SSRI  I woke up feeling     not euphoric  but     normal  fine  okay  No feelings of dread or despair  or wishing I could just sleep forever  There was morning sunlight coming into the room  and I lay there for a bit thinking how nice that was  and realizing that it had been months and months since I had been able to notice how nice the morning sunshine is  I've had recurrences since then  and I've had to adjust my medications numerous times due to side effects or a specific med becoming ineffective for me after a few years  But I've had good psychiatrists who 1   Listened to me and took me seriously whenever I felt there was a problem with my medications  2   Were knowledgeable about a wide range of medication options  and 3   Were flexible and creative with adjusting doses or combining different medications  I talk to a lot of people who went to a general practitioner  or a second rate psychiatrist  who prescribed the latest "breakthrough" drug  or some old standby medication they always prescribed  and then when the results weren't good  the doctor would basically blame the patient  So these people went on suffering terribly with depression under the mistaken belief that "antidepressants don't work for me " Ooh  I could just throttle the quacks who treat their patients that way  if any practitioner tells you you're out of options with medications  or that the side effects you are experiencing are "not typical for this medication"  i e "you are imagining things"   find another doctor  You can feel better  Non chemical strategies such as cognitive behavioral therapy are important  too  and can be very very helpful  but in my experience I couldn't use those tools effectively until my underlying biologically based depression was under control  I wish you luck  Do not give up    You are going to have a good  fulfilling life    Take a shower  wash off the day  Drink a glass of water  Make the room dark  Lie down and close your eyes   Notice the silence  Notice your heart  Still beating  Still fighting  You made it  after all  You made it  another day  And you can make it one more  You're doing just fine   Hugs  ive gone from 50mg to 100mg in bad times recently  and i find myself suicidal every morning   its been about 3 weeks   should i keep going  You should buy a pet that will keep you company and love you    and also finding a girlfriend over time  D good luck hope all works out for you  3 I second what  u leap2 has already said  I used to have extreme panic attacks very often and it has been going for a while  but therapy really helped  Note that therapy doesn't always mean "go take a bunch of pills"  there are many kind of therapies and a lot of them what you could call "talk therapy"    I underwent Cognitive Behaviour therapy and it helped to reduce the intensity and frequency of panic attacks  It also teaches you how to help yourself without the need for distracting yourself  with video games for example   I'm just throwing this one in as an example of non pill taking therapy  I know there are many more but I have no experience with them    So the best thing to do would be to consult with your doctor and take it from there  There is an important distinction that needs to be made here    'Ideas of reference must be distinguished from delusions of reference  which may be similar in content but are held with greater conviction'  13  With the former  but not the latter  the person holding them may have 'the feeling that strangers are talking about him her  but if challenged  acknowledges that the people may be talking about something else'  14  https   en m wikipedia org wiki Ideas of reference and delusions of reference  A delusion is fixed and false and cannot be reasoned through despite evidence to the contrary    I assure you not everyone hates you   and I bet you can find some examples for yourself to counter this  idea  and  feeling   It is a cognitive distortion that can be reasoned through  If you  believe  everyone hates you  you may provide elaborations for your delusion like you are damned or a mastermind villain    I think the gray area or spectrum for this may be if there is a great delay in your ability to reality test    We start wiping stuff out and we begin to lose ourselves    Which makes memory loss during depression even more fun  Nothing I do these days makes me feel any better  I go outside  listen to music for a bit  I feel momentarily alive  Then I come back inside  and I start dissociating again  I think "Oh  if I watch a movie I like  it would motivate me to get going again " Nope  Maybe I feel kind of good for the hour and a half of movie runtime  but then I crash into the ground again  I'm "out of it" practically 24 7  I don't even feel like myself anymore  if that makes sense  I don't even have energy left to contemplate suicide  which I did until fairly recently  I feel like I'm hurtling towards  something  awful  but I don't even know what that is  Hey thank you  that made me feel better  What have you done for your social life there by now   The most straightforward thing would be for you to jump in the cold water and try to talk to people until you find someone you get along with  but I suppose you already did this Ask your teacher if she could place you somewhere else  this always worked for me    And if this won't work  I would still talk with someone about it  Either your parents  a trustworthy teacher or someone you trust  Maybe they can give you advice I always struggle big time this time of year   Nice to know I'm not alone   I'm starting to think that CBT is not working for me as it should  as you have mentioned  It has helped some  but the constant negative thinking and terrible flashbacks still get to me  Maybe I'm just not trying hard enough or maybe I just need to see a psychiatrist and get put on medication  Yes this is the typical approach  DBT is a special form of CBT   Hang in  there  Take the pills  Do the therapy  Focus on what makes you feel things  And do your best to not forget that you are wanted and needed  no matter how your brain tries to tell you otherwise  I encourage you to tell a friend  but only if and when you're comfortable  You're putting in the work  and that's commendable on its own  Keep it up    Sorry for such a long reply  The short version is  if by any chance Sertaline doesn't work  don't give up and find a good psychiatrist who won't give up on you  either  Life  Is  Good  Sorry to hear this  Sadly there just doesn't seem to be anything promised in this life so it seems we're all picked off pretty inconclusively  I think in some sense  at least he's not hurting anymore so that's good  It's a cold world and we're all huddling towards any trace of warmth we can find   I hope you find some warmth xx I guess we are similar  Personally  I just tried my hardest to talk to people  Phases in where my depression was weaker than usual were very useful to me  It was extremly troubling  but I managed to get into discussions and being part of a normal chat can build up a lot confidence  So from there onwards  my anxiety got smaller and smaller and I think I can defeat it   Hell I'm 23  never had a boyfriend and I know that I will end up being a crazy cat lady  For some reason the thought of getting old and living with cats alone isn't so bad to me  Yes  but I wouldn't worry for this occasional and yes  legitimate use of sick time    I haven't been to work since before Xmas due to an episode that landed me IP  Will not be going back until PHP is done  Work doesn't have the details and as a temp employee there is no way for me to interact with their HR    scared   I smoke weed very casually  I was told by a psychiatrist once that it could have a similar effect on my mood as alcohol if I used it extensively  I trusted her  She was an exceptional physician  and this wasn't in a part of the world where marijuana was really stigmatized  I have heard it can worse mania    Generally  though  I think the research about bipolar disorder and pot is pretty inconclusive at this point though   There ARE long term consequences of smoking marijuana  though  They are well documented  and don't forget about them    My general opinion is that pot is great for anxiety and mild depression  It is probably better for your body than an antidepressant  and CERTAINLY better for your body than taking benzodiazepines regularly   Why did your parents think that your franchise idea was mania  Mania is normally marked by other things rather than just grandiose ideas  If nobody ever had grandiose ideas we'd never get anywhere   Edit  also lithium isn't most doctors' first choice when it comes to a mood stabilizer  Usually they'll try you on something milder like Lamictal  I've been on plenty of meds but never lithium  My doctor just does not want to put me on it  and I understand why   IF you are bipolar  trust me  the right combo of meds is the best thing compared to living in your "normal state"   Having ADHD also has a tendency to be comorbid with bipolar   Don't give up please  You might just meet somebody someday who understands you  You can take comfort in pets if you like  but just don't rule out that there is somebody out there please   Be careful  it won't make you happy Can you please tell an adult so they can report this to the police  This is not your fault  Those guys deserve to be punished  I have considered it    Especially since I hold out hope she will change her mind    Since she just went 180    Maybe she figures out everything I did was for her    This hope however is destructive    It has almost completely shut me down   However   I plan to add to this post for more details   It might sound sad  but I pray maybe someone reads it that can maybe help     Sadly  I didn't post a lot of the craziness      I can be your someone to talk to Dude that is freaking awesome  good job  Keep going  you got this   Remember   You are smarter than what they tell you  Stronger than you think you are  and Braver than you believe   Have a nice day  You have to dig deep and try to figure out if this just isn't the right thing for you  or if you're wimping out of something that could be really good for you  Forcing yourself to do something that you dread won't lead to anything good  but avoiding something simply because it's uncomfortable isn't good either  I just saw some quote in the past few days along the lines of "the comfort zone is a safe place where nothing ever grows"    Being humble and vulnerable enough to admit when you're bad at something is really freeing  You could choose to have a good humor about it  tell the class leaders how inept and silly you feel  compliment the other students who are better than you and learn from them  Maybe you could approach one of the leaders separately after a class and tell them how you're feeling  maybe they'll have an idea whether they think you'd be better off sticking with it or not    If it's not where you belong  that's fine  but try to replace it with some other pursuit then  Maybe just working out in general where it's not a group activity   Nobody in my family was ever athletic or helped me understand how to be so I know that's frustrating  I did come to find my own love for weight lifting  although I've ignored my own health for a few years now    Giving up is only self sabotage if you're giving up too easily  Nobody wants to have a class scheduled that they dread thinking about for the entire week  If you don't want to be there  don't do it  But just challenge yourself by asking if you're giving up for the wrong reasons   1  It doesn't mean that  You definitely will see literature saying antidepressants are not useful for bipolar disorder  This is because research is not definitive yet  Lots of people with bipolar II disorder  probably bipolar I as well  take an antidepressant  Very common  They don't work for everyone  But having efficacy on an SSRI doesn't rule out bipolar II   2  My reaction is usually "you'd know " I have bipolar II  I wouldn't sleep for days  like 3 hours across a week  and would feel euphoric  talk so fast I'd choke on my words  Afterwards I'd be like    yeah not normal  Even though hypomania isn't full blown mania and you can function  you're still abnormally up up up  With that said  I didn't know at first and was only diagnosed when I was 23 after being treated for depression since I was 19  Things just kind of kept getting worse  Just talk to your doctor about highs you have and see what they say   3  Mild is a weird word because different drugs effect different people  But yes there are treatments that require less of a "commitment" than lithium  i e no blood work or being careful with liquid intake    4  Something that we cannot tell you  but I have heard it is normal for your body to have mood swings a bit until it readjusts to not having the antidepressant  Generally  though  you shouldn't have just stopped without a doctor   5  Not sure  Yup  I told my nuclear family about my awful time in out of state college  how I got to the point of suicide  and how I barely recovered through the college counselors   It was really hard  but really good for me  Now that my parents know  they have drove me to the therapist  psychiatrist  and I can tell them how I'm feeling   However I only tell my dad some things as we got a lot closer after I told them everything  For example  at one point during my time back home  dropped out because suicide and they agreed  I practiced hanging myself in the garage  Fortunately I didn't go through and told my dad about it later  I don't want to tell my mom because she won't be able to handle it well   good luck to you man  this world is more interesting with someone like you in it You should contact your doctor immediately and talk to him her  I would defiantly get someone with authority involved it sounds like they took advantage of you which is not ok  Well done  I don't know you  but I'm proud of you for seeking help  Remember that that help is there even when you're at your worst  This is not your fault at all  Please tell an adult so they can notify authorities  I am so sorry this happened to you  Thanks  I appreciate it   Your words mean a lot   I'll try my best to keep writing and persevering   A vent is a vent  it shouldn't matter if it's good  so long as I can get things off my chest  I got on sertraline about 10 days ago   I was on 25 mg the first week and then up to 50 mg since then   I would talk to someone that you trust  if you can   Other people can sometimes notice symptoms that you cannot   I definitely have noticed side effects and effects  but they changed from day to day at first  but now things seem to be stabilizing   The side effect were generally mild and tolerable  one day  no sex drive  which is unusual for me  another day  light dizziness  another day  a nice feeling of calm  another day  heartburn  another day  diarrhea    Good luck   When I'm feeling low  I buy computers and computer upgrades  In the last few weeks  I've bought a surface tablet  16 GB ram and an SSD hybrid drive for my desktop machine  and I just bought my dad a chrome OS machine  Thanks  that means a lot   I really appreciate it  You have depression so it's normal that you don't want to participate in these social activities  They  parents  school  society  might drag you by the collar  telling you this and that  and you might kick and scream in retaliation  your life may just be a constant fight because of this tragic condition that you  like me and so many others have to take shit for   But I think it may comfort you to know that regardless of what anybody may say  you're definitely NOT wrong or unjust  Stay safe and PM me if you wanna talk xx Congrats    I hope they help you  I have depression and finally started taking meds for it last year  They helped immensely for me and I can live almost normally   whatever that is  Best wishes dear  What was the subject you liked  Maybe you can bring something nice for yourself to eat or drink if the day starts to get bad or lonely   Tbh with you I can't tell  I do dread it all week  I just don't know  I like how aggressive people are in there  It's the only place where I got that outlet and actually feel like a man  But yeah  idk    My gut is telling me that I would like it if I was brought up knowing how to be physical and all that stuff you described   Formatting doesn't fix a broken computer    Not always  I'm sorry for your medical condition and for the fact no one has tried to help  But frankly I also understand your classmates school admin for their reaction  Sure a passing 'are you better' would have been nice  but this happened before the holidays  Half of them probably don't even remember what happened  Hell  I don't remember half of what happened the last day of school either    And I'm sure your teacher meant the best  They can only do so much   Tackle this problem one issue at a time  You'll overwhelm yourself if you focus on all of these various things that are causing you anxiety and depression    There are two things that you can immediately work on with little to no risk of making your social anxiety worse  your parents being overbearing and trying to control your life and your porn addiction  You should confront your parents about them pressuring you to get a girlfriend and tell them that they need to realize it is only making things worse for you  You should also explain to them how you are feeling    they are your parents and will love you unconditionally even if they don't understand  I would   STRONGLY   recommend seeing a therapist to talk about these issues  That is something that has no negative side effects even if it doesn't work for you    For porn  I would at least recommend cutting it down  I know it's pretty hard to break an addiction  but if you can really put your mind to it and tell yourself why this addiction is bad you will be able to break it    So what if you're a virgin  I was a virgin until I was 25  It's not a big deal  Trust me  I hate seeing myself in the mirror to this very day  And I have a woman that wanted me  It will get better  you just have to take the necessary steps to start beating it  Therapy being the biggest one    Have you considered taking medicine for your depression anxiety  That would help in a big way with your university program and beating the social anxiety associated with that    Please feel free to PM me  i'd be glad to listen to you if you need to say anything else   I rarely eat  food makes me feel sick  Unfortunately  I'll try with the drink though  thank you  Art  it was actually really helpful for a while and I felt like I was working through some of my problems but now I just cant seem to even start painting drawing most of the time   Hey  if you want to talk  you can always PM me Yup  I told my dad I needed to talk to him about 5 minutes ago  he said "About what  I need to go somewhere now " And my mom also went with him  and they will be here in only 3 hours  then they make up excuses like they are going to sleep already although they stay up for more 3 freaking hours or something   I don't really have anyone to talk to on school  I'm infamous there because of how bullied I am  people just dont want to talk to me   I don't know what to do anymore  if I really go to school tomorrow I'll just come back home after the first class and make up an excuse  I see  Maybe you are missing the relationship with the teacher or your classmates    I'll talk to you  I would much rather be helpful than sit here and continue wasting time  Opposite for me  I spent most of my years partaking in social nonsense I now feel embarrassment for  I don't know why but my voice has this really grating aspect to it I can't personally stand and I feel like I used to whore it around pretty shamelessly under the false impression it carried significance  Well it doesn't get out as much as it used to and I'm okay with that for now at least  I see  Yes  you could bring your favorite soft drink  if you have one    10 49 right now  Went to bed at 11 and just woke up  It's strange how when the moment I wake up all my problems seem to vanish  Then 5 minutea later everything comes back  I just really want to stay home  I hate school  all my friends are online  and I can barely see it due to our time zones and because of how much time school takes away from me  Well there is that pineapple soda I drink all the time  my friends think I'm addicted  Probably am   It's often my only source of sugar haha I think partially yes  With my class mates  I've never really understood how to make friends with people so I think they're really nice but dont know how to start talking to people out of class and making real friends  I think they think I'm too weird to be honest  Thank you for replying by the way  I really apreciate it   I'm not quite on the same page but I think I can relate somewhat  Quite a while ago now I was dating my best friend  First girl I swear I was falling in love with  I felt I would actually like to spend the rest of my life with her   Unfortunately though  shit didn't work out  I was already depressed but losing her hurt me so much  Today I'm not looking for a girlfriend or love  Thats too much work  Really I still miss my ex and think of her time to time  Except it doesn't hurt me anymore   In terms of love  it was amazing but hurts at the same time  It hurts not being able to see that person  getting in fights  and when they feel sad  It's totally worth it   I think I still love her and would get back together if we crossed paths again  However  I'm not interested in anyone and not looking  It's too much work  I have too many problems  and it's just easier to go straight home  Pineapple  That sounds nice    You could bring that  It's really hard xx  Are your friends from online forums  Hey  don't beat yourself over the head too much  This entire break this has been my sleeping pattern   Fall asleep at 3 4 AM Wake up at 6 7 because of conditioning Go back to sleep till 9 10  Force myself to go back to sleep to avoid reality Roll around in bed till 2 3 PM and finally get up  Honestly that made me laugh because it sounds like dark humor  Whats your new years resolution    I want to die   D You're welcome      Okay  I'm sorry you feel that way  It's nice to have friends    Maybe you are concerned that they will reject you    I pull out Mind Over Mood and do a little  It's never enough that I feel great after  but the book makes it clear that it'll be a while before seeing real results and I feel good about taking my life into my own control and actively working to make myself better  A sense of accomplishment is decently effective and pulls out the hopelessness a little for me  It's also usually easy enough to do   Also going for a walk  even a short one  but I don't really do that as much in the winter  Real easy to do though  No  they're friends I met on Steam   Gaming plataform  It does get better  I promise  so please keep fighting and don't give up and if you ever want to talk to someone I'm here for you  hugs   Yeh  I think so  I think I just assume everyone already has as soon as I meet them and they just dont want to be rude  Do you think it would be good to ask if they want to do something art related  I have anxiety issues so I find socalising makes me nervous   I think the general rule is that most of the side effects fade off after the first month  and you just basically have to tough it out   Most of SSRIs don't even reach their peak benefit until after 8 12 weeks  I will thanks    I'm with you guys on that for sure  1 moment when you wake up you feel great then the next moment you're like  dang I need a couple cans of Pringles to crunch my problems away This certainly wasn't your fault and don't ever think it was  Like all other comments  contact authorities  You aren't you when you're drunk  you're easy to be manipulated  that happens to all of us  but those boys took it way too far  All I can really beg of you is to not be embarrassed or feel like you're less of you because of this  Right now embarrassment shouldn't prevent the important issue at hand  So far it seems they did three things capable of getting them in trouble  they gave alcohol to a minor  they had sex with a minor  which is bad enough on its own  but they also seem to have done it without consent  and they proceeded to harass you afterwards   I've been on sertraline for 1 year and it has changed my life  Six weeks to the day after I started taking it  I woke up feeling like someone I hadn't been in 2 years  I no longer wanted to die  I almost cried when I realized I was myself again  Don't give up if it doesn't work right away  You might get physical energy back before emotional energy  try to be patient  I still have days where I want to crawl in hole and hide  but it's not an all consuming feeling anymore  it's easier to keep going  Taking things one day at a time became possible  I hope things work for you  As someone who just a few months ago had basically no future  now i have my license  my own truck  and a job helping the developmentally disabled  It can be done  good luck we all know you can do it  I see that it makes you nervous  But I think it would be a good idea to ask them if they want to hang out or do something art related as you said  You could get together and draw and have tea  or go to a museum or something   Maybe you have thought about that already  It's not easy  In this world it's clearly an important skill to be able to love ourselves because we can't depend on other people all the time  Everyone is just broken in their own way and it's broken people depending on broken people  Sometimes it helps me to be kinder to myself if I imagine a separate person  with all my problems and faults  and realize how quickly I would be kind to that person and tell them that they still have worth and value   The things I absolutely hate myself for  that I haven't been taking care of myself  I keep breaking promises to myself  etc  any other person that sat next to me and told me that  I'd so easily be able to tell them that they are still worth while and they just need to try again  Try to be friendly to yourself   She's a minor  it doesn't matter if it's consensual as long as this happened in the U S  or any other place with an age of consent over 15  which is most places   If she's in any place where the age of consent is over 15  which is pretty much almost every place on earth  it's rape  there's no excuse  I too am having social anxiety  Recently someone send me this  article  http   waitbutwhy com 2014 06 taming mammoth let peoples opinions run life html  about understanding it    I am not sure if it's able to help me but I wanted to share it nevertheless  I have and I will give it a go  its just a big step for me to do something like that   Sounds like this happened at least two days ago  sounds like she would've cleaned up in that time unfortunately  though I'd be willing to bet that the site still has evidence   Yeah  I try to sleep as long as I possibly can  only get out of bed when it physically hurts to be there any longer  Then I take two steps to my computer chair and spend the day here   Shit   I argue with my subconscious a lot as well  Yeah  when you've built a life with someone for 5 years and it all comes crashing down around you  you're willing to do a lot  if you're in school I guess you are 15 17  I'm quite confused that your parents don't intervene  Have you clearly stated that you tried to kill yourself  that an incredibly bold statement and it just seems odd that they ignore it  if it is the case  maybe you didn't get the point across  I'm hoping your parents care for you  and I guarantee they do   I struggle incredibly when talking to my parents about these topics  they hardly know anything  I say you should see a doctor as they are someone you can talk too   I'm hoping it's free in your area  and can at least give you guidance  If it's like the UK  you should be able to get counseling for free since you're a student   Anyway  what else are you going to do  you're not going to school so go to the doctors  just see someone  Remember that although you should go to school  if you sick then you should take a break  It does wonders  I'm certain  I still do the same now and again in college    Lastly  for the bullying  I'm not sure what to say  I was lucky and never had to deal with it  Just talk to your school  I'd recommend your nurse or tutor first or whichever teacher you like the most  ultimately  they are there for you no matter what  The bullying is just one more factor which is holding you back and it will not resolve itself    Remember that karma can be a bitch and I hope they get screwed over for bullying you   P   unfortunately  even if School wasn't compulsory  you still need it and you should keep going   Happy new years to you  It will be a rough start but I hope the best comes your way      I totally get  it   I have cats too   One of my cats loves to spoon   He's the little spoon obviously     Almost always we lay on our left sides  he's on my arm with his head on the pillow just below my chin   Sometimes  he lays his head on my face   He fits perfectly and he likes to curl his back feet into my arm   I love it   Dealing with severe depression  I still sleep more than I should and having my cuddle buddy helps make things better   He's 16 years old and has lost his hearing   I'm going to be devastated when his time comes  not that I argue it's more like theres someone else in my head  I talk to them often and even during daydreams or thoughts I refer to it as sub  That's good  I think it is a good sign that you want to give it a go    Of course you'll have to expect that some people will turn down your offer  but I hope your former class mates will say yes    If you haven't been encouraged to find friends and to socialise by your parents it is a little more tricky to learn it on your own  but it  can  be done   If you think you're going crazy  you're not  Crazy people don't know they're going crazy  Hang in there man   Go for a walk  Fresh air always makes me feel better  Do you by chance play Pokemon go  Try to walk to a spot to get more pokeballs  Yeah it's been a slow and brutal process of trial and error for the last six years however  So I've slowly been increasing my doses over that time frame to where I am now    It wasn't like I just suddenly jumped up to it in a span of a few months   Friend I've been there before  There are other people  It may not feel like it now but I promise you there are  Life isn't worth ending over one person   Not sure if you have ever tried to kill yourself before but if you try and fail well  the next day is no walk in the park  I have attemped multiple times about 7 or so times over the past 10 years  Well the next day is a very odd feeling all your seritonin is gone and if you thought like you felt like a zombie before this is a million times more zombified  Watch some motivational videos on you tube it helps me when i feel down i reccomend a video called why we fall  Get your GED   I see   that's great that you have these friends xx  I'm not much of a gamer but you seem like a cool kid   I'd be your friend    Sure you can  You don't have to be constantly down to be depressed  Even depressed people can have good moments or even days  For people with MDD  major depressive disorder   the pattern is they'll be in a relatively normal emotional state and go through depressive episodes which last 2 or more weeks   I have pretty much been doing the same thing you have  I'm happy to talk to you if you can talk to me May I call you Pat  You can call me Erico  if you want to   Pat  are you taking any medication  Also  are you going to a therapist  I've been facing depression for some years and sometimes even the videogames doesn't help  What is taking me away from the bottom are meds  constant visits to the therapist and a new set of behaviors and mindsets I want to adopt from now on   If you need to talk about strategies to cope with depression  you can PM me anytime  it's all very first world problemy  which makes me feel worse for feeling like this      i'm an assistant to the head of a company in an industry i'm not passionate about  i'm constantly over my head even after a year and the pettiness and passive aggressiveness of my inexperienced boss just isn't worth it if there is nowhere for me to go in this company  the goal is to find something in the right industry because thats the whole reason i moved to this dang city in the first place  it's just a hard industry to break through    as for living   currently share a one bedroom with my roommate  she has the living room  and we've had a wealth of problems with our landlord  she's stuck up and self involved  bedroom door won't shut  had no power for a week  shower constantly leaks  no bathroom faucet for the first two months  just blatant neglect on her part  especially considering how much we're paying   the goal is to move into a cheaper part of town and find at least a two bedroom  but a three would be great cuz we could get a third person and pay even less  but since we're looking at the lowest tier of pricing and we're both girls who would very much like to avoid gang territory  almost went there last year   it's stressful    it's all just very daunting and when mixed with the existing depression and anxiety just sends me into a spiral    okay  vent over  will continue waiting in the dmv for some rando client of my boss now      You are an amazing person and everything will be go alright I promise   hugs  Sounds like a Tulpa  It's exactly what you're talking to  I tried forming a Tulpa but gave up quickly  but that's cool how you formed it naturally  They're not harmful  they just act like humans but instead are inside your head  I'm around that age  I just don't like to tell exactly how old I am  well  my parents just tried to calm me down when I said I wanted to kill myself  and then after a big bullying problem I had with 3 guys I had to go to court or something like that  and when they asked why I wanted to kill myself  and before I could even end talking about one of the many reasons the "therapist" said  "That's not a reason to commit suicide" I got really angry but I couldnt do anything   Well  bullying  I remember this day  2nd June 2015  I was on my bike while going back home after school  I lost control of it and I fell  I had large cuts on both my elbows and knees  half of my face was red and burning  and I broke 2 teeth  instead of people being normal and fucking helping me they just laughed and walked away  I didn't go to school anymore until september that year  Im still really angry at those who laughed at me  and some times my class even makes jokes about that  which I don't take really well  I just wished it happend to them aswell  I had the wounds from the accident for a whole month  and I didnt go out during all that time because I didnt want people to think I was a monster  and that was during summer time     I really hate that I NEED TO STAY IN SCHOOL  but eh I cant do shit about it  Thanks  same for you  Therapy is good  if you can get some antidepressants try them  If you find yourself having serious suicidal thoughts  call an ambulance    Also  in order to have a healthy relationship  you will also need to have friends other than her in the long run  I'd try joining a club   finally finding real friends was what got me out of my depression almost two years ago    I know it seems silly  it's just that on top of my growing depression it just became too much to bear  I was starting to picture we would have a future and he basically just told me the next one has to be the one and I'm not it    And that's the joke isn't it      Depression is something only we can face on our own  I'd rather be told that then be comforted with lies by my family and friends   that they'd be there for me no matter what   No   I am important and loved by myself  By others  I don't believe so  I have so few reasons to believe that  I'll not sugar coat it   I depend on myself for so long   the only light I do see is my own dim light  Until the day human beings can truly connect with each other by sharing real memories  feelings  thoughts and more   selfishness and narcissism  and yes  the global wide spread nature of depression  will be major obstacles in humanity's drive towards a better tomorrow   How can we start to build better societies so far away when people at home suffer  neglected by those they called loved ones  family or friends  Do you see the punch line  It might seem stupid  but I dont know what that is  It doesn't matter if she was forced to drink or not  It also doesn't matter if in the moment she resisted because she didn't have her proper faculties to consent  which wouldn't matter anyway because she's under 18  Seriously  what the hell  I'm glad you think so  thank you    hmm I didn't know that they had a word for it   You have to allow people to "take your side" while still being able to accept some things you might not want to hear  I am on your side  One thing has to be crystal clear  you are correct  it is not okay how those people treated you  Nothing else I say means that I am defending them  It was not okay   On the other hand  you did allow yourself to keep getting into these situations  In your last paragraph you specifically listed the things you don't want to hear more of  like that you're overreacting or that it's somehow your fault  Well    you can't ask for advice and then tell people what response you want from them  Then it sounds like you think you already have all the answers  so you shouldn't need help from others   There is absolutely nothing in the universe that a human being should be able to say to somebody over a telephone that makes that person think the next 13 years of their life was ruined  Rejection is painful and once again I am not saying that I defend however she treated you  If she said something horrible she is an asshole for doing it  But letting that wreck you for the amount of time you claim it did means there is something missing in you    No matter how other people treat you  harassing them and breaking windows is clearly not okay  You just played into their trap  After all they did you to  it ends up being YOU getting the police called on you and looking like a manic   All I can say is that at this point I certainly hope you understand to have no contact with any of these people or that specific family  If you would ever let this happen again then it is your fault  If that woman called you today and said she wanted to fuck your brains out and marry you and to please forgive her for everything she did  you'd deserve whatever happens next if you fell for it    She sounds like a psychopath  Somebody who is so miserable in their own life that she entertained herself by messing with someone else's feelings  What kind of grown person calls up a man  agrees to meet with them  acts flirty  all so later on they can laugh at you over the phone with two other guys  She's an idiot  But you're an idiot for ever talking to or agreeing to see her again    You've experienced a lot of emotional trauma  no doubt  But the way you titled this post  I expected to come in and read about someone who had battled cancer 5 times and lost their legs or something  There are people who have had worse lives than you  too  Your life got ruined by one stupid group of people that you just should have distanced yourself from as soon as they were mean to you    You did not deserve what happened to you  But what more can be said to help you move on  It's great that you already haven't talked to her for a while  Don't ever do it again    I do understand a lot of the other stuff you talked about  I haven't had any social media either for the past 5 years  and back when I did I only had a few friends too  Since 2012 I have hardly seen anybody  I sit in my house and don't do anything  People mistreated me and the way my friendships and relationships ended caused me to sit around and be miserable for many years of my life too    Everything you spoke about is in the past now  You have to move forward and if you feel like you can't then you may need to try to speak to somebody who can help    Believing that you have the worst life story ever and that people should bookmark this so they can show it to other people who are feeling depressed and snap them out of it  is not a mindset that is going to move you forward in life  You did deal with a lot of bullshit and mistreatment from other people  but you also haven't experienced other types of suffering that people in other parts of the world might be dealing with  But most importantly it just doesn't help you  As they say about anger and resentment  holding onto it is like a grasping a burning rock that only hurts you  It's a poison that only kills you  those other people are living their lives and moving forward    I'll say one final time  you did encounter some very unfair treatment and some sick sick people who got a thrill out of messing with you  You don't have to let it define the rest of your life and you don't have to give up hope  On this planet of billions of people  so much of your mortal existence has already been wrapped up in this stupid woman and what she did to you  That's a real shame  Try as hard as you can to not let a single other day of your life go down the drain ruminating over the things that happened with her    I do believe you're a good person who acted out of frustration and feeling like nobody was on your side  You have to have some self love and self respect that will steer you away from situations like this in the future  You have to be able to like yourself based on a set of standards and ethics that you define for yourself  You can't let your opinion of yourself be defined by other people  because good friends are almost impossible to find these days and there are a lot of predators out there looking for victims  Try to be good to your mom if that's really the only person you have in your life right now    Try to have a better future  It's up to you to want it  Nothing that happened to you has to have any permanent effects  She didn't take your legs from you  she didn't take your life from you  You were embarrassed in some stupid situations but embarrassment can be survived    If you want to cling onto this story and believe that it's impossible to have a life now  you can make that reality come true too   Which workbook do you have  I'm looking for one now but there are so many   When I'm feeling down and alone  I listen to a song called  Shits Gonna Be Okay  by I Fight Dragons  It helps a bit    hugs   Yeah basically  I dunno  I'm just annoyed that I can't be happy  I have spent all day in the weight vest I got for Christmas  It's adjustable up to 30kg  I've filled it to 15kg which doesn't seem to make much difference to anything  really  But it's too restricting at 30kg  Not worth it  All I can say  Learn from your mistakes  better yourself  Killing yourself solves nothing  same here so many bullshit happened today to the point  that i feel like dying from it  Read your post  heartaches  I feel truly sorry  I wish you strength  because it's the only thing that can make hard lives easier   And remember  when you're on a downswing eventually you come back up  You just need to keep on going until then  Have hope  and take care of yourself  You have to allow people to "take your side" while still being able to accept some things you might not want to hear  I am on your side  One thing has to be crystal clear  you are correct  it is not okay how those people treated you  Nothing else I say means that I am defending them  It was not okay   On the other hand  you did allow yourself to keep getting into these situations  In your last paragraph you specifically listed the things you don't want to hear more of  like that you're overreacting or that it's somehow your fault  Well    you can't ask for advice and then tell people what response you want from them  Then it sounds like you think you already have all the answers  so you shouldn't need help from others   There is absolutely nothing in the universe that a human being should be able to say to somebody over a telephone that makes that person think the next 13 years of their life was ruined  Rejection is painful and once again I am not saying that I defend however she treated you  If she said something horrible she is an asshole for doing it  But letting that wreck you for the amount of time you claim it did means there is something missing in you in terms of self love    No matter how other people treat you  harassing them and breaking windows is clearly not okay  You just played into their trap  After all they did you to  it ends up being YOU getting the police called on you and looking like a manic   All I can say is that at this point I certainly hope you understand to have no contact with any of these people or that specific family  If you would ever let this happen again then it is your fault  If that woman called you today and said she wanted to fuck your brains out and marry you and to please forgive her for everything she did  you'd deserve whatever happens next if you fell for it   She sounds like a psychopath  Somebody who is so miserable in their own life that she entertained herself by messing with someone else's feelings  What kind of grown person calls up a man  agrees to meet with them  acts flirty  all so later on they can laugh at you over the phone with two other guys  She's an idiot  But you're an idiot for ever talking to or agreeing to see her again   You've experienced a lot of emotional trauma  no doubt  But the way you titled this post  I expected to come in and read about someone who had battled cancer 5 times and lost their legs or something  There are people who have had worse lives than you  too  Your life got ruined by one stupid group of people that you just should have distanced yourself from as soon as they were mean to you   You did not deserve what happened to you  But what more can be said to help you move on  It's great that you already haven't talked to her for a while  Don't ever do it again   I do understand a lot of the other stuff you talked about  I haven't had any social media either for the past 5 years  and back when I did I only had a few friends too  Since 2012 I have hardly seen anybody  I sit in my house and don't do anything  People mistreated me and the way my friendships and relationships ended caused me to sit around and be miserable for many years of my life too   Everything you spoke about is in the past now  You have to move forward and if you feel like you can't then you may need to try to speak to somebody who can help   Believing that you have the worst life story ever and that people should bookmark this so they can show it to other people who are feeling depressed and snap them out of it  is not a mindset that is going to move you forward in life  You did deal with a lot of bullshit and mistreatment from other people  but you also haven't experienced other types of suffering that people in other parts of the world might be dealing with  But most importantly it just doesn't help you  As they say about anger and resentment  holding onto it is like a grasping a burning rock that only hurts you  It's a poison that only kills you  those other people are living their lives and moving forward   I'll say one final time  you did encounter some very unfair treatment and some sick sick people who got a thrill out of messing with you  You don't have to let it define the rest of your life and you don't have to give up hope  On this planet of billions of people  so much of your mortal existence has already been wrapped up in this stupid woman and what she did to you  That's a real shame  Try as hard as you can to not let a single other day of your life go down the drain ruminating over the things that happened with her   I do believe you're a good person who acted out of frustration and feeling like nobody was on your side  You have to have some self love and self respect that will steer you away from situations like this in the future  You have to be able to like yourself based on a set of standards and ethics that you define for yourself  You can't let your opinion of yourself be defined by other people  because good friends are almost impossible to find these days and there are a lot of predators out there looking for victims  Try to be good to your mom if that's really the only person you have in your life right now   Try to have a better future  It's up to you to want it  Nothing that happened to you has to have any permanent effects  She didn't take your legs from you  she didn't take your life from you  You were embarrassed in some stupid situations but embarrassment can be survived   If you want to cling onto this story and believe that it's impossible to have a life now  you can make that reality come true too  what if I was crazy before because this feels like a sample sized version of that  A couple things to note about sertaline  I take 100 after titrating up to it from 25   The side effects won't come on for the first few days  if you're lucky  you won't notice any  You might get a bad headache for a few days and maybe some urinary retention  After 4 weeks  you'll start to notice the positive and negative results   Your anxiety will fell like it has faded and you'll feel better inside  Most SSRI's  with the exception of Prozac  take time to start working   Good luck  I think you'll be happy with the results  If not  talk to someone about it  Try something out  A lot of picking the right meds is careful guesswork  You're not insane  Insane people don't know they're insane  or that they're going insane  Therefore you're either overreacting or need help  I suggest you figure that out and work from there   Well if you want to add me on Steam my nick name is Twyger  I'm sorry this is happening to you  It sounds very similar with what happened to me  I internalized a lot of other people's bullshit and it really messed me up good  I still think back and wonder how people could be so cruel  I left my town  I don't talk to anyone from there anymore  I don't talk to anyone from high school anymore  I barely talk to anyone from university  I went home for the holidays and I realized just how toxic my family has always been  even though they don't understand that they're being toxic  I try to stay away from them as much as possible because they have so much influence over my feelings of self worth   I still have my really awful days even though I'm medicated  I've had a school therapist for a bit but I'd like to find a really good one for dealing with my childhood issues and whatnot  My school therapist suggested I try self compassion meditations   they're a little goofy  but they seem to be working for me  At least  they don't hurt  Maybe they might be helpful  I'm so happy for you      It may be a rocky road  but at least you're walking down it  You've got this    you really should  it's one of my favorites and i'm sure that as a drummer you'll like it a lot too  and i'd be sad to hear if you quit drumming  i bet you're really good at it and not pursuing something you love is always a tragedy ykno You are not a piece of shit   Lost access to my steam xD    Perhaps there's a better way of phrasing this for a 15 year old rape survivor   I've always looked at my mental health as a war that I'm fighting  I think it helps to imagine a tangible enemy    On that note  good luck fellow solider  Don't be afraid to ask for help   Pm me im always up for a talk      I guess I'm a little weird  I don't feel loved either but it really doesn't bother me  Guess I'm just kind of a loner  I have friends    but I don't see them often  except for one  I guess all I can really say is get out there more  When I found who is today my best and really my only friend it really changed my life  because looking back  our friendship almost didn't even happen  I was too shy or introverted or maybe even stupid to realize how amazing our friendship would be  in the end  it was him who kept texting me  He kept texting and texting and texting and I hated it  but without that friendship    fuck I don't know where I'd be  Get out there  make some friends  and don't let anything hold you back   It isn't about whether or not they care  I'm sorry to say it but if you're only doing it because you want people to care then you're only getting help for the attention and that isn't the point  The point is to make yourself a better person  to be happy  to make a difference  you name it  The point is to have control of your life  That is it    'Those are not delusions  Delusions are things that are out of possibility  Something like the government is following you  aliens  conspiracy theories  alternate realities  or magic powers  Those are delusions  Everyone not liking you is a real possibility'  Heh   This is good information but perhaps could have been communicated more gently   it's bad enough thinking everyone hates you  who needs a professional saying "yeah  that might be true"  If you think by telling your family that you're depressed is gonna make them sad  then what do you think they will feel if you kill yourself   Pm me tho  im always up for a talk   I was admitted at the advice of my psychologist  The best advice I can give is to try and stay open about what people are saying  Although I was in a 7 hour outpatient  it took me 5 days to start to listen and be willing to talk   Give them  and yourself  a chance  it's going to feel tacky  Love is a gamble sadly  It can crush you emotionally if you partake in it    I wish you much love and want you to know you're definitely no less valuable as a human being regardless of what anyone else may think   Stay safe and PM me if you need to talk xx Yeah kind of  My depression comes in the form of me just not wanting to do anything  I just kind of waste my life away in my house  but I think I'm a good person  I guess all of that alone time gives me time to think very philosophically  so I never really give in to that sort of  "I hate myself " shit   You have kids  How old if you don't mind me asking  If you're uncomfortable answering you can give a general idea of their age   Thank you  Simply thanks  I have loving people in my life but they just don't understand  Your words give me hope that maybe someday they can  and without having gone through this   The most hurtful thing someone can say to me is "just get over it" without knowing     I always felt worse if I did nothing productive on a day that I was down    On days when even getting out of bed was a battle  I got a sense of accomplishment from even the smallest things  It may feel impossible  but maybe you should go to school just to do it  To prove to yourself that you can    And who knows  maybe today is the day where you meet a new friend or hear about an interesting club  Or  its just a normal day  Either way  you'll never know if you don't take those first steps out the door     Not at all  Please  pretty please go talk to your parents and or the school councilor asap  Was a waste of 25 years eh  I'd say you're about to waste 55 years but hell  that's just me  When you're upset  cry your heart out  and then you will come a point when your tears dry up and you cant cry anymore  Nothing will affect you anymore    That's the point  your weakness will equal your strength  and from that point you can only grow stronger  So  never stop yourself from crying out loud   My apologies  Yeah that was really the only thing I noticed  but I may just be acting overly protective so take my comment with a grain of salt      Edit  I have ADHD and I feel as though I often have trouble with communication as well so I somewhat understand  but in no way am I trying to diminish your difficulty by mentioning mine   I simply wanted to say you're in good company  Everything is going to sound like worthless bullshit  But try to be open when you can  and remember that everyone there is trying to help  Best wishes       I'd totally be willing to try that instead of wanting to die   I've heard that consuming certain kinds of mushroom can come close to "reseting the brain"  But I'm really no expert on this so you might want to ask other people who know more about it   Thanks    I just have been hit with the worst new years    My wife is filling for devorce   We just had a baby and I'm a wreck    I don't know what to do with my self  That sucks  its never fun to feel alone    Try to look for love outside of romantic relationships  Friends can offer just as much  if not more  love as a SO  Its just platonic     One day at a time    My mom is similar  She'd always be on my case like study study study   I feel like it just served to make me hate studying which sucks because I've always believed studying could be enjoyable w the right approach but it feels like she never cared about that aspect of it   When I help my niece w her homework  she doesn't enjoy it  but I try to do my best to actually make it somewhat meaningful for her instead of just being some chore she has to do    I'm in the same boat as you and have an exam in under a week that I'm not fully prepared for but I'm just like fuck this fuck this fuck this  I'm sorry tho   it sucks for sure   Stay safe and PM if you need to talk xx Im with you   Take a shower  It's like magic  I swear  or like  u d co said  go for a small walk  Even if you don't feel like it   Theres nothing shameful about needing meds  I've been on three different SSRIs  and have a couple Xanex for when my anxiety gets bad  Mental illness is often caused by a chemical imbalance  and medication can help fix that    Also  I think you would benifit from visiting  r anxiety as well   Thank you  I hope whatever is bothering you sorts itself out  X Thanks  I just feel incredibly stupid and blindsided   I was feeling it yesterday  I stayed in bed till 3pm and even then it was a struggle  I just didn't want to deal with the world   Why did you stop taking them  Did you consult your doctor before doing so  Then the important thought is that you realize how to build yourself up from your past   I'm already home  I had an appointment with a psychiatrist that was set up by my physician  It was a month away and was the earliest available time  Going to the ER successfully moved my appointment up to tomorrow  Had they not been able to get me an appointment they would have admitted me  I basically promised not to "hurt myself" before tomorrow   I've got that feeling today where you can't even be bothered to talk   you know what you need to do to feel better but it just requires an inhuman amount of strength  I really hope you feel better  Thank you for commenting  X Hi again   I'm really glad you're taking positive steps to get healthy   Being willing to seek help is a huge step   and I'm proud of you   even if I don't really know you   So   What are your hobbies  I'm pretty nerdy   I play a lot of video games and read a lot    Yeah  I have to fight the surge of anxiety when he asks how my day was and it was bad  The easiest way for me is to take a deep breath and try to say "not good" or if anxiety is really bad shake my head no    Maybe try texting him about it  It can be easier to get thoughts out when you can see them before hitting send  Is there any school counselor you can talk to  Might help with some of your problems and even make finding friends easier  Yuup  You're literally fighting your own brain and it sucks ass    I have days where I feel 'normal'  but they can be a battle to reach  I keep myself going with promises of  one day  and  someday  and  eventually  I'll be okay every day  but why the fuck isn't  someday  today     slams head on desk  good point  I am the exact same way  Nearly every minute I'm living in a fantasy world where all my dreams have come true and I'm surrounded by people who make me happy and totally understand me   I know it's not the most healthy way to live and spend my time   but it's the only way for me to survive and not go crazy in this world  I don't know why I have a tupla but the fact I formed when I was a younger and the was only kid on my street might play a role  I feel better today  I let myself feel like shit yesterday with the understanding that I would get to the gym this morning and be productive at work  Going to the gym in the morning is a huge part of my fight against my depression and I am still riding the endorphin buzz  I'm not being too productive at work but that's mostly because we're slow right now   Here's something I do when I'm feeling overwhelmed  I think of one simple thing I can do and call an accomplishment  Maybe it's taking a shower and brushing my teeth on a really bad day  Maybe it's do a load of laundry  Or maybe mow the lawn  But it's one simple thing  8 10 I wind up doing more than the one thing  1 10 I just do the one thing  And  of course  that last 1 10 is the times when it just doesn't work  But  I'll take those odds    Hope you feel better soon   First days can be very bad  Patience  You can easily change your steam account id via the Steam site   I'm also looking for a new community and I heard good thing about guild wars 2 i bought the new expansion and started playing but working full time is hard on a gaming lifestyle   From what I hear the guild wars 2 community is really good so I would suggest that  Sorry about that   Have you tried to distract your mind by thinking about other things while brushing   I'm guessing you already tried different flavored toothpaste  It sucks doesn't it     I feel like shit when people assume that I lay in bed a whole day or eat cereal for dinner because I'm lazy  And that if I "just" put a little effort in I wouldn't be so sad   "Just think positive " "Why are you so negative all the time " "You create your own happiness"  If it "just" were that easy I would already have done it  Does people really think that someone would feel like this if there was a choice  Do you like coffee  Go put a pot on  and make yourself a cup  The ritual of it  and the caffeine  helps me get motivated to do    something    Also  an easy thing would be to go grab a book and read it in your livingroom   Life sucks  It's true  BUT you don't suck  YOU are AWESOME  You know why  Because 9 years with this illness makes you a God damn HERO that's why  Believe it or not but many many people don't even make it 5 years let alone 9  You are amazing and powerful  Keep at it depression can be beaten  and you can do it  Try and get some help somewhere  a Doctor or try making one of those friends a little closer  People might not understand but they instinctively want to help rather than push away someone who is honest in their feelings  You are amazing and beautiful keep at it  One day at a time  Im here to talk if you want    It's short for General Education Development   It's a program available for drop outs or people tired of the drudgery of the institution  which in the continental United States must be respected at the same level as a high school degree  Basically  take 6 months of class  take a test  so yeah it's still work  but you can do it on your own time and your own way  My brothers been struggling with the same lack of motivation to complete the drivel monotony of high school  so he's taking steps to move past it on his own terms  in a practice way  You can claim the independence you want  and still have the basic education credit needed to succeed in society  Would strongly recommend you check it out   Good on you  I started that this year too  and honestly feel like it has helped me maintain a baseline in a way I don't normally  or haven't since I hit puberty   Best of luck  and I'm happy to PM if you want to talk about anything  This is what I want to feel  Setraline didn't work for me  but I really hope my new Wellbutrin will   I had this happen except it was a customer  I told him my friend commited suicide and he still asked for help rather than leaving  I was so embarrassed  I helped him and he left without a word  I take a very low dose of Xanex as needed for my anxiety  but you may want something thats more chronic    I am of the opinion that going off your meds because you feel okay is a bad idea  I also come from a family of people with lifelong mental illnesses  like bipolar   so my opinion is likely skewed   Well he didn't leave me because of my depression  or at least I don't think  I didn't really get a clear answer from him  but it certainly didn't help the downward spiral I was headed in already  I'm sorry that happened to you I'm glad you're feeling better  That's great advice  I think my one thing I'll set myself to do is tidy my room as it's a mess  I'm seeing my counsellor tomorrow which I'm really hoping will help  I know so many people have it worse but I'm just in that mindset today where you just think 'why did I have to get depression and anxiety ' How different my life would be without it  But I do believe there are positives to it too   even on the worst days like today  Thank you for your kind words  I really hope you continue to feel better   I know about it  I even do the rhythmic motion too  usually throwing something up and then catching it  It gives me a rush of excitement and makes me forget about my problems  but I worry I'll never do anything about them because of it  Somehow we're in the same boat  Sometimes i hate being shy and have social anxiety  bcs people tends to take advantage of me alot  And i just let them  However  i try to overcome it by downloading chatting dating apps  At first i just talk to people in there  even when people asked to meet up i didnt go  But as more and more people i talk to  few people make it easy for me to step up my game and meet them in person  And that is actually how i overcome it  Meet them in person as a way to challenge myself to beat social anxiety with baby steps  familiarize myself with communicating people from different backgrounds  different way of thinking  etc   somehow you learn alot from different types of people you'll meet   Well I might check it out  Oh that sucks    I'm not having one of those days  I'm having one of those lives boy   I'm literally too much of a pussy to do anything except sleep  and even that I probably only do because it's the most passive thing possible  All I've been doing for weeks now is sit on my pc and sleep  and yet I'm still so tired that even taking a shower takes 3 days of motivation and working up to it   The thing is  I wouldn't mind if it only affected myself  but I'm directly hurting people who I love with it and affecting their life too  which fucking sucks man   I know that "I can clean for others but not for myself" issue  One website that has helped me is  Unf ckyourhabitat  http   www unfuckyourhabitat com     Progress will come slowly  be patient with it  Good for you to take the first step and I wish you well  You're not a pussy  you're dealing with a mental illness and you mustn't punish yourself further  I know how that feels though  I hope you can find something that helps motivate you and you feel better   Thank you  I haven't cried in months  I was also hoping it would make me cry  Didn't work Hey friend        The love of my life  my fiance  kicked me out before Xmas   and said she feels like she had been living a lie    That she didn't want this life with me        Im broken   I'm sad   I have not gotten out of bed much   I've contemplated killing myself       Then I think of what I could be missing   I love her so much   and I'm tore into little pieces but I remember all the good times we had   The end wasn't good   but everything else was wonderful and that's what makes me miss her so       I am learning to love myself and realize there is a whole world out there   Maybe it's not at your door   but it's out there      Please don't end it friend   Be sad   be broken   but know it will pass   Know that this gives you perspective later in life       If you want to talk   I'm here   I'll even call you   Lord knows I could use some friends as well   Just know that even though it feels like it   you are not alone      I think your right  I was just using that to show that I didn't even think about the times where I saw Aliens as being a delusion  Lol  Or my belief that my Bipolar is actually some form of a magic power  Or that we are all God and through mediation and reaching enlightenment we too can walk on water and heal the blind  and have made important life choices based on these beliefs  Didn't even cross my mind  lol  And even after he said those things I still didn't think they were delusions  I just thought I was more enlightened then him  Lol    I do think though this idea feeling that everyone hates me is definitely a grey area and a prominent problem in my life and I do need to go to counseling to work through how much of that is real and how much it is in my head for sure    I'm sorry for your loss    And I also thank you for your words  I needed to hear them    First of all  I'm so sorry this happened to you  Don't feel embarrassed  As a mom I can tell you that two adults acting the way those men did is disgusting and probably criminal  They are the ones who should be embarrassed and feeling like they want to die  not you    The most important thing is to protect yourself from STDs and pregnancy  You can call a rape crisis hotline  1 800 656 HOPE  and ask about local treatment options  Planned parenthood or a women's health clinic can also help you  Some local crisis centers can connect you with a trained adult who can help you through the exam  and through the legal process if you choose  so you aren't alone   If you trust your parents  I recommend talking to them about what happened  And definitely speak with someone anonymously on the hotline  Even supportive parents sometimes can't relate  or don't know how to support you    If you get a rape kit done  you don't have to decide today what to do  It's there  in case you decide to press charges later    You are not alone  And the most important thing to do is guard your physical health  and your mental well being  The police can help you with a restraining order or pressing charges  but they aren't always trained to be sensitive and understanding about trauma  If you go to the police and they are insensitive  don't take it personally  or as a judgement on your worth or honesty  They're just doing their job    Best of luck to you  I'm sorry you went through that  and I know sometimes the embarrassment about your peers talking about you can be the worst part  But it's not your fault  Reach out for help and support  It's there for you  What if others are dealing with it too but they just don't cry about it on reddit like me and actually push through it or whatever  That's what I think   I was going to let this conversation drop as I have to get back to pretending to work but something you said struck a nerve with me    "I know so many people have it worse   "  Nope  nope  nope  This is a very unhealthy thought process to ride  There is always someone who has it worse and if you start comparing your problems relative to others then you'll just feel like shit for feeling like shit  I spent my teens and 20's in this spiral  I finally learned that my problems matter  The things that make me feel like shit  external or internal  are important because they are impacting my life  My depression isn't as bad as my friend Robyn's but she's still there to help me when I'm down  My friend Jeff is bipolar and his lows are way lower than mine  But he still listens when I reach out  Don't negate your feelings  And for damn sure don't let anyone else    Sorry if I sounded like a dick there  Bit of a pet peeve of mine that fucked my life up pretty bad for a long time   Do update us with the results    Please dont    Fuck man that's rough  People are going to tell you that they only want to help  but it depends on the hospital  I know two of my friends were unwillingly admitted  we're minors  after suicide attempts  The one I'm closer to told me a bit about it and it was awful  Absolutely awful  She told her mother that if she ever put her in that ward again  she would kill herself just to prove a point  Hang in there  Hopefully your facility is better   man the parents which do this are the worst  my childhood where my friends used to go out and play  I used to spend studying  and now they and I are same place no difference  only difference is in everything else which they can do and I can't   Agreed  It did lead to a total emotional breakdown in this meeting too  He's actually kind of an inconsiderate and insensitive doctor  I'm starting back up my counseling and Meds again after a hiatus  and think I will be looking for a new doctor and see how it goes   Just got back from my doctor  got my first Lexapro RX  really happy to come here for the first time to see this post at the top   I'm nervous too  I've never taken anything like an anti depressant before  are tuplas able to affect me physically cause that happens sometimes   Remember to be patient with it  Sometimes drugs like this can take some time to really show what they can do for you  Thanks for the response  Your sharing of your positivity and experience helps  if just to know that someone hears me that understands  Looking at your comment history you help a lot of people and don't get a lot of comments back  You are appreciated friend   Yes it was     It was actually really genius in terms of how most of Mac's arguments go  I also love the "donkey brains" thing with Frank    I just love this show period haha  I can't wait till the new season   I personally think the worst thing you can do is make yourself feel worse when you're already really low  but I also understand the mentality where you can't help but beat yourself up  I know how it feels to feel like you're a burden to everyone else  And to hurt other people who so want you to be happy  If posting on Reddit makes you feel better  then absolutely do it  I'll edit it to say 'Which could possibly be true   '  I needed this today  Thank you  you don't sound like a dick  this was a really helpful comment x I think most people get put on that first   I was unable to orgasm while on it lol   So I went on another  Doooo it It's legit Sweet     I have to say I think season 7 is one of my favorites  I also love the episode when the gang decides to go on a road trip and Dee gets shitfaced in the car  picks up that teenager  and tries to convince him not to run away to California  where she thinks his future will be a male prostitute  by singing that "Runaway Train" song to him  Every time that song comes on over the radio at my work it makes me think of that and I crack up   Thanks  Reach out if you ever need to talk  Good luck at your session tomorrow   I thought for a second you just called him a piece of shit  I was seriously about to go into battle against you  Hello      I'm so glad your life turned around  It sounds like there are some really good things in it right now     I completely understand the thought of "my life's good now so I SHOULD be happy " Try to reframe that thought      The wonderful things in your life right now can't erase or cancel out the effects of your past trauma  The trauma was never processed so unfortunately it's still "trapped" in your nervous system and your mind  I'm not sure if you can ever "get over it" but you are absolutely capable of reprocessing the trauma and healing from it       Your history will always be your history but through therapy it won't always sting  trigger you or have a hold over you      At the moment since your PTSD has not yet been addressed  OF COURSE you feel depressed and anxious  You are not wrong at all for having these feelings  It's a perfectly normal response  The depression and anxiety you're feeling has to do with your past  it is NOT a reflection of how appreciative you are of the good things in your current life     I understand the nervousness about your upcoming therapy  That also is natural  Yes  there will be uncomfortable moments in therapy  Maybe think about it like you're taking care of a wound that you've had for a long time and has become infected  The healing process is going to hurt a lot in the beginning  taking the bandage off  disinfecting the wound  Very painful      but necessary if you'd like it to heal  Know that going in  that way you're not going to run away or quit therapy when you feel anxiety during therapy      The beautiful thing is that when you start healing  you will be able to feel more joy from the good things in your day to day life like your husband and child  Try to envision this  what your life looks and feels like when you can "access" that joy  Keep a mental picture of it in your mind  Recall this picture whenever you feel nervous at any stage during therapy       It's not easy or quick but it's doable  You're a survivor  You survived your past so I already know how strong you are  You can do it  You are worth it  Life on the other side of therapy is worth it      Much love to you  Have courage  I'm here if you want to talk yeah SSRIs typically say 4 weeks to feel     Did your Doc test you for Thyroid problems  Mine recently found this and it was REALLY affecting my energy as well  Most Doctors don't think to test for this on men  as it is more commonly diagnosed in women    but she tested me because I have family who have the same problem  I can't say that it's a huge improvement  but added with my other meds It is a lot easier to work at least  Prozac takes time to start working  too  Well your appointment is today  but feel free to shoot me a PM with absolutely everything you want to complain about  I know what it feels like to want to tell someone  anyone   something  anything  It's tough  But you're not alone  I found that doing some intensive therapy in an IOP really helped me to counter the social anxiety   paranoia I experienced  If you have the time for something like that  I'd highly recommend it   Wow that's really freaking harsh  I'm sorry he changed   You're the best thing that's ever happened to someone  You might not feel that way  but you are  You are loved  you are cherished and each day is a new day to start over    Give em hell  friend   I appreciate your post  Thanks  The question "am I delusional or not " can definitely be inadequate for understanding your beliefs  When I'm trying to assess a problematic belief or thought process  I think about it along three axes  each scaled from 1 100   First axis is probability  where 1 is "this is a proven  verifiable thing that is currently happening " and 100 is "this is impossible " Second axis is degree of belief  where 1 is "I do not believe this" and 100 is "I believe this with every fiber of my being " Third axis is degree of distress  where 1 is "this doesn't bother me" and 100 is "this is so upsetting that I'm in a constant state of panic and unable to function "    Very few things are impossible  but some things are so vanishingly improbable as to essentially be the same thing  "I can teleport to Mars this afternoon" can pretty easily be rounded up to a 100  Whereas  say  "the FBI is keeping close personal tabs on me" could span more or less the entire range depending on your political activities     When your second axis doesn't square with the first  there's an issue  and it helps to discuss with a trusted third party    a therapist  a close friend    to try to figure out what's up  If I am 100  convinced that the FBI is following me  but it's objectively unlikely that they'd be so invested in my activities  I want someone to persuade me of that latter part  particular if this belief is really upsetting to me or keeping me from doing things  Which is the third axis     You can also believe in things that you  know  are impossible  which sounds completely contradictory    but human minds are  I believe  and I'm not being facetious with this  that I could speak Russian in an emergency  I have never studied Russian on even the most elementary level  but I believe I could do it in the same way that a mother can lift a car off her baby    fueled by adrenaline and  in my case  an ability to tap into the collective unconscious and draw language from it  Do I  know  this is ridiculous  Yep  Is it  to quote the language of religious discrimination laws  a "sincerely held belief"  Yep  And since it doesn't bother me at all  and isn't dangerous   that should probably be a fourth axis   I don't feel the need to try to reality check my way out of it     Your belief that everyone hates you sounds  using the language of psychology  anyway  more like a cognitive distortion than a delusion  but I think what matters more than the terminology is how you are able to disprove or minimize this belief  and decrease the amount of pain it causes you      Anyway  I hope you feel better  and it is extremely unlikely that everyone hates you     What is IOP   Same thing would happen with my but i'm too scared of being alone to stop messaging or talking to them  I wish life was kinder for the both of us     please don't give up    not just yet  I'm still alive because some part of me still wants to live  to feel  to give myself a chance at happiness    but right now all the pain in my system overrides the happiness I can envision  I hope you find peace   I hope I do too  I hope we make it through this    I hope we can get rid of our demons and start living the life we have always dreamt of  I really hope we do   Girlfriend  theres nothing you can do except to really put yourself out there  If youre not comfortable meeting people outside  theres alot of apps nowadays that can help you  However  it comes to the issue that its not easy for you to get close to people  the only key is to never give up  Even if you have talk to 20 people and you cant find the chemistry  you never know the 21st would be the one where you clicked  So my advice is to really put yourself out there    Less time with close friends  we cant really run away from this problem  Bcs people have their own life  especially when theyre in a relationship  married  have kids  etc  But maybe you can suggest a fixed meet up  for example every Sunday for breakfast  However  it doesnt hurt for you to get new friends though  It doesnt mean you will forget your old friends   Best is to get chatting dating apps  Doesnt mean you have to date anyone from there  but its a good way to practice on how to communicate with people    also way of learning more about life through people from diverse background   This reminds me of when my mom passed when I was only 3 years old  and I never got to know her  You are lucky that you got to spend time with your mom  cherish those moments and never forget them  "Have you then deciphered the beginning  that you ask about the end  For where the beginning is  there shall be the end  Blessed is the man who reaches the beginning  he will know the end" Understandable question to have  However  no one here can give medical advice   citalopram and other SSRIs do indeed have the potential to have problematic interactions with alcohol  but it's important to check with your doctor for recommendations specific to your medical history and situation   I went through this too  I was 26 and had only dated one person   You should be extremely grateful to be going through this pain  It forces you to be independent and figure out who you are as a person   It sucked balls for me  some nights I'de go to bed and cry but you know it's all part of the learning process    Plus  relationships are not all what you would want them to be  After 4 years of being single and going to bed every night wishing somebody was next to me I finally started dating someone new  After a while I just wanted my free time again and I broke up with her  We want want we don't have right    I'm on sert 100 mg  i think it helps  It gives me low bp though  Just yesterday slept for 13 hours I agree with everything you just said  I have 2 furry boys    Well  no one can diagnose your father here  However  his behavior does seem similar to certain personality disorders  The only thing that would really help in this case is for your father to see a psychologist  But given your fathers behavior I doubt he would be easily willing   Is there any way you can go to a psychologist  For one thing  a father being absent can have a great effect on you  And as such you may even have problems you aren't even aware of  A psychologist would also be way better equiped to give advice on these matters    Regardless  connecting with empathy can usually help anyone going through issues like this  although it will not solve them  Have you ever watched  this  https   www youtube com watch v 1Evwgu369Jw  video  Hi there  It sounds like you have a lot of things on your plate right now with your family  I'm sorry that's so hard  But it also sounds like you have a lot of great things as well  which is awesome  Starting medication is a huge step in the right direction  so WELL DONE YOU  Unfortunately  from my experience  new medication can absolutely exacerbate issues for anywhere from 4 8 weeks  You sound like a really strong person  Try to take one thing at a time  What also helped me when I've started or switched meds was reminding myself that my feeling so shitty wouldn't last  that the meds will eventually "even out " Hang in there  I'm here if you want to talk  Best of luck  Generally you won't feel much better  except placebo  for about two weeks  And the first one you take might not work  I hope you get lucky and this is the one for you though     Lol before you can even have a go at me  i think i would punch my face off first for ever saying that to someone  I've printed this off an put it above my bed  Your words are so kind  Thank you so much  It's people like you that save my life every day Would you like advice  or did you just need to vent   any small things that give you happiness  just small things Omg I'm currently watching the show  It's helping me distract myself a bit  It's hard to say  He might just be really lazy and not in charge of his life  a personality thing  If you find he has times when he just lazes around and doesn't do much or eat well  doesn't take care of himself  and then times when he has a lot more energy  maybe cheats on your mom during that time  gets very angry and is impulsive  you might consider bipolar  Then again  I have bipolar so I tend to see those symptoms when they might mean nothing   If all those things sort of occur together  I'd say it's just how he is  but I'm by no means a professional  Sometimes people don't take care of themselves or behave well and it's caused by a disorder  Other times it is their own fault  Thank you so much  I take medication for the depression but sometimes it is not enough to stop the pain  For you to recognise the effort it takes to carry on for so long is so so comforting  I'm so grateful to you I did the same thing today  I told my grandparents last night I was feeling severely depressed over the holidays and I still hadn't recovered  They flipped their shit  took my possessions from me and told me I was doing it all for attention and they were going to get rid of me    Oh  how much I love living  '  I am at a complete dead end  School's finished but no idea what I want to do  Studying business law right now and hating everything and everyone there  My parents don't understand my lack of motivation and simply get angry  I'm in no relationship and I can only open up to my friends when we're all drunk as they brush my problems off and say 'Just study something you like'  they don't want to help me  I have a 30kg vest too and I know what you mean  I only put the full weight in it when I am wearing it for press ups and things like that  It just becomes too awkward otherwise    It doesn't look wearing mine out in public really    It looks suspiciously like a suicide bomber vest Dude  if you want someone to talk to  I'm always at my PC when I'm not at school   PM me dude  I feel you  I am in a very similar situation  What I am trying to think of right now is that there's ALWAYS another option  You don't have to do something you feel completely overwhelmed by  Right  I know there's some stigma surrounding using the word 'trigger'  but some people do have actual triggers  mine being being in the same room as a man who abused me and my sisters   I hope you feel better soon  I feel very alone also  If you are able to get some professional help  that can actually help but it doesn't get you any real friends  For that you need extracurricular activities like hobbies  clubs a hangout  volunteer work  etc where you can meet potential friends and connect  Although it isnt a bad thing to make internet friends also  I am 53  I have very little family I live in my senile mother's house  I love her but she is almost deaf and pretty senile  I hate living here  I am not sure how to encourage you when I am struggling myself but the good news is that I am better than I have been previously so I know there are effective means of treatment  I send you hugs and encouragement and love  My name is Eileen  Best of luck  friend   Small victories  Holding onto anger is like grasping a hot coal with the intent to throw it at your enemy  You are the one who gets burned    You've been holding onto that phone call for over a decade and it's hurt you emotionally  physically  and mentally    I agree that you deserve to a have a happy life but I'm confused as to why it hasn't happened yet  Are you expecting other people to make your life a good one  Me too actually  I'm 23 and have never had a boyfriend  I went on a date for the first time a couple months ago  I was into the guy at first but when I had another depression episode a while later  I convinced myself that I should never share this burden with another human being  Idk  I just want a friend who I can cuddle with  And accept me and my depression  But I know my depression would suffocate my partner and I'd feel guilty for that   Glad you're planning to find a more considerate doctor  hopefully one who will address what you're trying to say rather than critiquing your terminology    Hey  I'm really sorry you feel that way  I hate school too  I can pretty relate You are 28  Your partying and slooting it up days are over  People change and you're getting older  Its fine to slow down and become an adult  If I were you  I would quit weed  It makes people lazy  and if you are an adult you can not be lazy  Get some dating apps  they are the single adults best friend  Just remember its okay to not be the same person as you were in your early youth   Same  Exactly the same  Hmm that's true  It's not your fault but thanks for helping  Adding to my spotify now  thanks so much for the recommendation    It reasuring to hear someone say that  Thank you  Thank you for making me smile  much love and hugs On 100mg too  Barely get more than 5 hours of sleep and get the weirdest dreams too  But that maybe because I'm also taking other medications too  Some things help others differently I suppose I don't have a good math tutor too      Don't be so hard on yourself  Everyone deals with anxiety in different ways and  I agree  it's not easy  It requires a ton of work and support which isn't easy when you're anxious and feel isolated    I get cut off a lot too  even by my bf  It's sometimes because I'm trailing or not making a point but a lot of times people get swept up in conversations and just have to get their thought because they think it's more important than what you're saying  Humans are all about the power dynamics and I'm a pretty meek person naturally  I have worked a lot on being strong and independent by meditating  thinking before speaking  and dealing with feelings of inadequacy and anxiety    Another vapid quote which may ring true in getting respect   If you don't respect yourself    I'm a joke     hopeless    Insignificant    No one will learn to respect you   Thank you so much  It's nice to feel like I'm not alone  Thank you so much for this  Words like this keep me going   You added a smile to my face Godspeed    What one man can do  another can do   Just done this and had a cry  I feel so much more human  Best suggestion ever  thanks so much  Hope it helps Me too  But for now I really appreciate the thought  I feel a little better after reading this I hope so too my friend  and the same for you Sending hugs to you OP  I wish for speedy retrieval of the criminal scum  They need severe punishment   Thank you Eileen  It is comforting to know that others are struggling too  makes the world seem less lonely  My name is Josh  and i'm very grateful for your supportive words  3  You can always PM me if you need to talk about something  Psychiatrist tried switching meds  seemed to only make my mood worse  As for dosage increases  originally I was taking 20 mg  Was upped to 40 mg and then again to 60 mg where it currently is  I also was given adderall for a while  and we concluded that it didn't seem to change anything whatsoever  When I tried Viibryd I went up slower than the introductory packet suggested to avoid the digestive problems it's known for  That worked  Unfortunately the Viibryd effect  and it was good  only lasted for 3 months  That was the end of that  I am actually content with my low entry jobs  I like not having to be so responsible  I'm a care aide  and a cashier  It's the bottom rung on the nurses spectrum and I'm happy to wipe butts  I don't have to deal with all the technical stuff  life altering decisions  and full fledged responsibilities    Thank you for sharing that page you linked  it was a like psych profile of me  I never heard the term 'self esteem attack' and now I have a word for all those terrible moments of panic that weren't really related to anxiety  It resonated a lot with me  I had the unfortunate luck to have to deal with all those problems without knowing what they were or meant    Don't beat yourself up though  It's something that page doesn't really include  I am brutal with myself  I have said things to myself that I wouldn't say to my worst enemy  I'm a learning to be more compassionate and gentle to myself  Try to forgive yourself for failing and try again but this time with a gentle approach to academia and yourself     I wrote at length about it  here  https   www reddit com r BipolarReddit comments 3vonfd marijuana cxpgdkh   and  here  https   www reddit com r BipolarReddit comments 3wwp7l weed and meds cxzrsmv    but my relationship with it's changed since then  I guess a super condensed TL DR of those comments is  weed helps my depression but can make me psychotic   Since then I've come to realize that the more I smoke it the lower my motivation becomes and the harder it gets to cope with stress without chemicals  But it definitely makes me euphoric  fantastic thing  and gets me to eat  problematic thing given my propensity for overeating   Food tasting amazing  unbelievably good orgasms  satisfying sleep  and a reprieve from dark thoughts makes it ideal for getting me out of a crisis  But I also abuse substances and overuse them  so it's definitely contributed to the 10lbs I'd gained since mid december   I recently learned that while it's gotten me out of suicidal depression  it had also caused psychosis that I thought was someone else's fault  That someone else had shared their super potent weed induced psychosis  but what I think had actually happened was that I'd hallucinated that  too  So whether the guy hypnotized me to believe it or I hallucinated him doing that  weed's at fault  And that psychosis is behind every time I've been inpatient and at least half of my suicidal episodes   It can make us manic  and with heavy use it tends to bring on depression  although the causality on that is still being investigated    For me  I use it to relax and escape depression  I also prefer it to alcohol  because alcohol makes me depressed but weed leaves me feeling better for awhile  My biggest issues with weed right now are the legal status and implications for employment  I'm on the job market   It still induces some psychotic symptoms if I'm careless  but I've got them extremely well controlled and am no longer afraid of them  I figure any significant changes to my beliefs I'd consider while I'm high need extreme circumspection  and I'm already able to identify and largely dismiss the hallucinations that made it dangerous in the past     TL DR  Weed is      nuanced       It's dangerous  but also lifesaving     PS  redditors   can we not  downvote every discussion about weed  Seriously  this shit has gotten old  It disappoints me that what's probably my most upvoted submission to BPR is about how weed causes psychosis  yes  it does  but every time anyone asks questions about it  where you'd have the opportunity to say it yourself   you guys downvote rather than have an actual dialogue about why you think it's bad  Downvoting silences discussion and keeps people from having conversations where you can tell them why you think it's a bad idea  Dialogue is how people grow  not downvotes  Listen to a podcast  I love listening to podcasts and the radio when I'm really uninterested in doing anything  It feels like I am part of the conversation and I don't feel as lonely  Seems like to me you've already risen above some of your demons  The sort of things you described from your child hood experiences destroys most people and you seem to have risen above it  You've proved that you're a strong person and that you can rise above some of the immediate issues that are now heavily weighing on your mental health  How are you a terrible mother  is a path  i was in treatment for almost a year and leaving them was difficult  but i managed with the support of my family and friends   i had a crisis 2 years ago  but i managed without drugs  i hope this experience helps you   The drugs are not the end of the road but small tools within a system I had a coworker come into the break room on a day that I was extremely stressed  She saw me trying to hold back tears  and failing  and asked me if I was okay  I burst into tears and said no  She asked me what was wrong and I told her that everything in my personal life was stressful  She told me that she'd be there if I wanted to talk more  I finished crying and felt so much better  I wasn't okay  but I was better   I thanked her the next day  It's so strange to see so many people who care  They care and show it and it's wonderful   Lost my sister 11 years ago and the one thing I regret is not talking that much about it with my family  They are going through the same thing as you  They are one of the few people that will understand  I am sorry your loss  Best of thoughts to you and your family and everyone who stod her close Thanks   I am so confused but maybe it's the best option  Why stay on a med that makes you paranoid anxious if you already deal with anxiety  Did you discuss this side effect with your doctor   Any changes you make you have to talk to the doctor first  Ask them to help treat the underlying anxiety and obsessive thinking you feel   When in doubt  just sleep it away  Not like stressing over nothing will lead anywhere  What the fuck They held you down and forced it on you after getting you drunk enough to be unable to fight back  Go to the hospital  file a police report  and report it to your school administration   I feel like I have known you  even though I don't know you   I'm 47 and when I was in college  I belonged to a RPG fantasy scifi etc club   I knew a lot of guys who were quite introverted  and what you describe about yourself sounds like you are too and that's not a bad thing   So this would make it more difficult and more frustrating and quite possibly less rewarding for you to socialize than it might be for others   Just guessing bounce these words inside your head and see how they sound   I also want to point out something not directly related to depression  but another mental illness   When I was thirty  I moved and had to get a new psychiatrist  have been seeing them since adolescence  long history of depression    When I told him my life story  one thing stuck out   I told him that for most of my childhood  I often felt bored   Long story short  sometimes  when some people use the word "bored" when describing social settings or life in general  it cooouuuld be  very tentative  not projecting  don't jump the gun   that the person is suffering from undiagnosed ADD   Mind you  not the hyperactive part  but the just the deficit part    So  when you couple someone who is naturally introverted with a touch of ADD  you get a person who WANTS all the pleasures of social interaction and WANTS to be involved in the dating game BUT said person also gets frustrated quickly  that's an ADD trait  and finds that the pleasures they can find on their own are easier to come by yet wholy different from the pleasure of social and dating things   As far as depression goes  your words don't suggest that to me  but maybe someone else can offer better insight   Good luck either way  Hug Thank you  yesterday was one of  those  days and I needed to hear that I'm still young and have plenty of time to do whatever I want in life       I met with my therapist this morning and actually did mention that some of the exercises seem bogus and like I'm trying too hard  He basically assured me that not every exercise is for everyone and that we'd eventually find one that worked  for me   i only buy online which is what makes it so hard  its easily accessible and always there when i feel anxious or my day is getting bad   That stomach pain sounds serious  I'm sorry you're in so much pain  Alcohol is an anaesthetic so it does numb pain    I don't know how to help but I think you should give yourself some love  I read so much self hate  I had a lot of self hate and experienced the same wild anger and frustration  Not knowing why I felt like that until I was much older  I still don't like myself very much but learning to stop hating myself really helped me deal with anger towards myself  I used to like going for long walks just to do nothing  think about nothing because I had that same feeling of not being able to deal with my own existence  Nowadays I tend to browse online shopping and play Candy Crush when I just can't deal  It's mindless fun   I want to hug you just so you can hug me back  Same issue same boat  Another year of no health insurance  That's pretty unsupportive advice  I get that it may not have worked for you  but that's not the case for everyone  OP took a big step today  and that's really important   There are limitless options when I comes to healing  and it's not going to be one size fits all      Be patient   You may feel worse the first week  but then it will most likely get a lot better  Best of luck  I lost my dad almost the same way 8 years ago except he collapsed from sepsis and died later at the hospital  Never got to see him  say goodbye  etc  Its a shitty  awful thing that hits you out of nowhere  and I feel for you    The only advice I can give you is try not to bottle it up and forget about it  Experience your emotions when they come to you  I felt nothing over my father's death for the whole 8 years up until recently when I had a huge breakdown because I finally realized he was actually gone  I would hate for someone else to go through that    I hope things get better for you     it's fine no worries   i appreciate your idea tons SSRIs do not make you happy  They block negative emotions  that is all That doesn't matter that much though  you're the only one who can see it and you only use it for logging in  All I can really say is that it affects some people really really badly  I have witnessed this in multiple close friends   I think  r Gaming4Gamers would be a better place for this  Congratulations  SSRIs have been life changing for me  but they take a little while to kick in  Give it a month  Try getting online courses  That's a lot for just saying how you feel  your grandparents are kinda idiots to do that  hey  thanks for reading and responding  Im not bummed about not partying or having to change  My issue stems from some deep seeded narcissism  When I was younger  and still today  I put too much self worth in how I look  I've smoked alot of weed and spent alot of time by myself in the last 8 years  and now when I look in the mirror I see a substance abusing  ugly  soulless  expressionless face  I feel emotionally underdeveloped  especially compared to my peers  which is causing me to feel like damaged goods because I remember how relaxed and easy going I used to be  but now Im trapped inside my own head thinking Im constantly being judged I can only imagine    I'm pretty new in learning about CBT   I find journaling the thought process is helpful  I recommend How To Deal With Low Self Esteem by Christine Wilding  I believe there is also a less specific version about CBT as well   I picked this up because everything was very simple and logical  She gives exercises such as keeping a thought catalog to help rewire your thinking  It's really helped me change my course but I still need lots of practice haha  hugs  We should be able to quit school whenever we wanted to    Why do we need to learn those fucking insane math problems and stuff like that    Waste of time  I wonder if CBD oil has the same AchEI action  I was having a hard time understanding some studies because there are so many different cannabinoids chemicals in cannabis  and it might depend on the extraction method used on the CBD oil   Well lets just talk man  Do you have a job  Parents  siblings   I'm impressed with all your sustained efforts       Have you tried Neurofeedback      Maybe the part of your brain responsible for motivation isn't as active as it should be  They'll be able to tell when they map your brain and help you uptrain it if necessary      I've been doing NF myself since September and it has tremendously improved my PTSD   anxiety  I've just moved on to the next brain spot which deals with motivation and it's going well      The downside of NF is its price  it's cost prohibitive for many      I first heard about Neurofeedback back in 2006 from a fellow research assistant  She was using it for depression  although it couldve been non brain biofeedback   TBH I just wrote it off as hippie dippiest nonsense at the time   Privately to myself  not out loud to her   The next time I heard about neurofeedback was last January when my physician recommended it  I still was resistant skeptical about it but I finally came around in September  I go to two treatment sessions a week and have seen great results   So have my husband and kids   I really wish I with more open to it back in 2006 or even this past January     Feel free to PM me if you want me to share more details  Actually that's exactly what I did when I was trying to learn more about it  I asked another Redditor    is there something you'd rather do  than isolate yourself   I'm fucking great at isolation  I'll stay in my room all day  I'll eat animal crackers and drink water from the bathroom sink if I think that would spare me pain or social awkwardness  But after a couple days doing that I'm so drained that I have to make myself do something  talk to someone  even if its a stranger  force myself to run  go outside   Not because I feel like it but because I NEED to feel alive again  for my own self  I dunno  it makes me sad to know you are isolating yourself  and you believe thats the only way  Yeah but it's cool    You can still PM me whenever x  Have you tried switching doctors and advising them of your self harm  Have they provided you any alternative options  Hi there  I'm really sorry you feel this way  I suffer from severe anxiety and panic attacks too  A while ago someone sent me  this  https   d3twuufqrfygff cloudfront net img qa how can i calm down during a panic attack 582 zmZjfXeW3ZOdzJdrV4Y  jpg   I found it quite helpful     Just hang in there  it gets better  I promise  You just need someone to help you   It is too bad that depression and suicide are so taboo on TV  It would be a wonderful medium to explore these issues that literally everyone deals with  Like when kids shows deal with heavy stuff like pets dying or divorce   Was on a great 2 3x a week gym streak  strength training and running  until the election  Then couldn't do anything for a month  Am going to the gym this afternoon to start back up again  good luck  Unfortunately I don't have it with me right now but I can try to look it up   The title is super generic like "dialectical workbook for anxiety " 8 years to get diagnosed  It was't difficult for me at all  I told my doctor I thought I had bipolar  he asked me a ton of questions  then agreed with me  That seems strange to me  I guess it would depend on the doctor  Goodluck  They've helped me a lot  Used to cry and feel anxious almost every day but since my doctor got me on mine  I haven't cried since and I can function much better during the days  Maybe that's a good idea  I just need to quit school  Sure  Hug They may block all emotions  People may report becoming numb on them  dead inside  dull  like zombies or robots  me too  hope it goes well for you    25 mg sertraline  going on my third week  They definitely help but be ready for some insomnia and loss of appetite  at least that's what's been happening for me  I honestly think moving is such a good idea  I want out  I literally hate my town  my college  the people  My family made one a big decision for me that I wanted to make myself in which college I wanted to attend  I now go to a socially desolate community college where its just like high school  I'm wasting my time here  Parents won't let me transfer and now I've missed out on key years of making friends at college  I may as well throw my remaining years in school in the garbage  Nothing will come out of them  My parents ruined any chance of having a good college experience  I had a horrid high school experience so I thought "hey college must be better " Nah  it's sucked  I legit don't want to live anymore  I haven't had friends in YEARS  These last 6 years have fucked me up and I'd rather kill myself then live through the remaining two years of college    I am medicated and in therapy but nothing is helping  Literally have done nothing but lay in bed and cry for the last week  My comfort zone is fucked so I'll never really ask people for plans  Every time I ask the answer is "sure " I text them and they don't fucking answer  They never contact me  Nobody ever texts me  Nobody ever wants to hangout  Loneliness  past experiences  my small comfort zone and the list goes on  All reasons I frankly just want to die  Hope so   I might be hyper at the moment for unknown  undiagnosed reasons  and it may be compromising my rather minimally effective judgement    As I contemplate crashing a couple months into the arms of the grim reaper with a sledgehammer  if I don't dare devil myself into a smudge first  this is great may be i should hv started with this Ooh I forgot about this  Good point Thanks I'll definitely look into that   Hey man  I read a quote somewhere that read  "Suicide isnt getting rid of the pain  its just passing it on to someone else"  You can think back to some time in the past and connect the dots of the path that lead you to where you are at this moment but you cannot connect the dots looking forward  you just gotta believe that they will somehow connect  I know that right now this may seem hard to believe but life is the single most important thing you will ever experience  dont give that up    Hang in there buddy    Theres no

unlimited freedom and the pay is pretty good  but Ive lost the passion for my job as well  Its not even something I like talking about anymore  I used to thnk it was a cool job  but it wont last forever and I dont really have a future in this position I have  My job situation is definitely a lingering issue  I have 2 sisters in their twenties who have their own lives doing their own thing with their boyfriends families  Im kinda left with my 2 parents in their early 60s  I dont live at home  but I stop by often to see how they're doing   My dad is the same as me  Hes been battling depression for most of his life  and in the last year 18 months hes been in a really low place as well  My mom smokes a pack a day and drinks wine almost every night  These are things I wish she'd quit  but shes been living this way since she was 18  She tried to live more healthy but she was a nervous wreck and didn't feel like herself so she just fell back into her regular lifestyle  Our family has alot of love in our hearts  but not enough tough love to identify problems and try hard to fix them   My dad never really listened to me as a kid  He would sit and listen  but offered pretty generic advice and not much guidance  For a long time I felt like I couldn't be myself around him becuase he was the man of the house  I dont really know how to explain it but I hope you can understand that    Welcome to the club  Give it a little time  you'll probably get side effects this week  and good mood effects in a few weeks  so don't stress if it doesn't do anything for your depression right now  just keep taking them on schedule and reevaluate in a month I don't see what's so unusual or freakish about your situation  to be honest    You met a shitty woman who proceeded to manipulate you and make you suffer    You held onto her words because you were manipulated and suffered a long time because of it    It has shattered your self image and you can only find sexual release through escorts    It's unfortunately a very common thing to be manipulated by people  It's very common to only have sex with escorts because other relationships are too difficult due past hurt and poor self esteem    None of it is hard to believe  It's just a really long series of seriously fucked up events people that led you to where you are now  It doesn't seem highly unusual or freakish to me  People are can be horrible  manipulative  liars  cheaters  and they get away with it while being happy as clams and having loving families and friends  Life is really unfair    It takes a lot of mental training but if you commit you can learn to let these things go  It's not easy but being miserable isn't easy either  it's just familiar    If you need some help or support I would recommend therapy above all and then r relationships  Those guys are harsh critics but they can have some really good insights and support  My advice would be to simplify and try to make your diet more anti inflammatory  For example  buy or grow broccoli sprouts  sulphoraphane  instead of the store supplement  which is less effective  That way you don't have to worry about supplements that could hurt you in the long run  because good quality food couldn't hurt you in the long run I'd really like to just leave them and never meet them again but I keep running into them  i had to stand behind my ex in a queue for lunch and she was with like 5 mates all giggling and whispering and I was there behind just silently wanting to kill myself   Nothing wrong with being comfortable with where you are in life  Hell  I love video games and TV  I binge watch so much   I wish I had something more than a generic response to offer you but man  fuck that bitch  You gotta do what you feel is right for you and try your best to shrug off the things you can't control  I started a great new job in the fall only to quit come winter after finding out the manager was a complete ass clown  I powered through it for as long as I could but at the end of the day it wasn't worth walking on eggshells all the time  and I got another job offer anyway so it was no sweat  If I were you I would take some time to evaluate the pros and cons of the job and make a decision if you want to stay or not  Unfortunately only you can make that decision but I think you will make the right choice  If you love the work and think you can tough it out until you get promoted or she gets fired then by all means go for it  No sense in living a life of regret just because other people get in your way  Good luck  I know you will come out on top of all this  What do you mean  I made a post a couple of weeks ago about me wanting to change because I don't want to be myself anymore   I'm mid twenties and between the money and the lack of effective treatment  I've just come to embrace what my life is   I hate how ducking much I depend on my friends   even though I have a few   I wait all day for a text or call and when it doesn't happen I worry they are out having fun with others who actually progress through their lives    I wasn't always like this or maybe I have been like this and just noticing it now  Buddy i feel you  I come from a messed family too  When it comes to family its the ones who you can count on who matter the most  not the ones who make a negative impact on others  You have a good job too  When you are 28 its not about how fast you can chug beers  Its about how stable you are and about your job  You got one of the two down so just work on the other  Like i said dating apps are your best friend  If you don't meet up with any girl just chat with them  If you fake it for long enough you will start to become what you are trying to be  chat with anyone man  Talk with friends and go to a bar with them  Do not dwell on the past  Especially don't dwell on who you used to be because no one can become who they were back in the day  Literally no one  Everyone changes as they get into adulthood  Just wanted to echo this  A lot of people prematurely stop ssris because it feels like it's not working  You may have some effects before then but it typically does take a few weeks for the true action to take hold   I felt like that a lot in school and it was because I was self sabotaging myself  I would psych myself up and then do absolutely nothing  The method I used to do anything at all was to go really slow  Just write down one sentence and then go get a snack  One more sentence and then watch TV for a bit  Eventually  I would find a good source or have an actual train of thought that would result in a paragraph or two  Don't be so hard on yourself and just write while being out of it    I'm feeling pretty out of it myself right now  I was planning to go to the gym but I've been on the computer for hours and I'm contemplating another cup of tea for the motivation   I know the real motivation won't come though  I just have to shut off the computer  put on my work clothes  and jog to the gym  But that cup of tea is signing its siren song    Understood   SSRIs are just a step that some people take with varying degrees of success  They will probably not single handedly solve someones problems without taking additional steps  or they may not prove helpful at all  but blocking negative emotions can be helpful in taking those next steps   I just think that given the forum we're speaking under  it's important to provide constructive support not just blanket remarks stating something won't work  Probably  I go through bouts of depression  Usually in 7 8 month sprints and I get it worse in the winter  That's called SAD  how appropriate   No  I forgot setting an appointment with the psychiatrist and could only set one up a month ahead  It didn't seem urgent for them so much and I just let it be  I thought I could be fine without them since I was very anxious from living at home with my parents but I've moved to a private apartment since then  thanks man  even a simple interaction like this is making me feel better  tbh Im not worried at all about my party life  Ive never been very social unless alcohol is involved  Lately Ive been thinking about how cool it would be to find a nice girl and escape from reality with her  Move away and start a new life away from everything I used to know  The problem here is I feel so insecure and its hard for me to pursue woman without feeling like Im being creepy  especially because I look burnt out now and expressionless  Its a real mess in my head right now  I could literally feel like a god with alot of confidence one hour  Then maybe an hour later I might feel like a piece of shit creepy low life failure who's life has already peaked This is really interesting and helpful   I like the way youre thinking about it with your axis model   Im wondering how awareness fits in  though   The first time I experienced a delusional manic episode before I was diagnosed  I knew that other people would consider what I was thinking doing crazy  so I lied and hid it and did what I wanted secretly   But it never once crossed my mind that I could be delusional   I just thought that I knew something that other people didnt   I wasnt able to reality test at all because I had no idea I needed to   Now  Im diagnosed and on lithium  which helped me to realize that I was delusional previously  but Im again struggling with some irrational and bizarre thoughts   The difference is that this time  Im completely aware that my ideas could be considered delusions while at the same time believing that they are true   This is a much more confusing situation than when I wasnt aware that my thoughts could possibly be delusions  and Im having constant debates in my head about whether my thoughts are true or not   Im also comparing this to earlier when I had no such debates because I was 100  certain   How do you think awareness of the possibility of delusions factors in  I don't really know what to do with my life either  I screwed up with school and work resulting in a lot debt and working back as a cashier part time    I'm sure you're still good at things  I messed up but I'm still a great cashier and I'll find permanent work as a care aide soon  We all screw up in our life  It's no reason to be so hard on yourself  Give yourself a break  take some time alone to relax and figure out what to do   Are you still in school  Can you talk to a counsellor about a lighter course load  I had such high hopes  I felt like this too  "well I did it "  4 kinds and a year later     no help   Yeah  that's what happened to me Indeed the four noble truths start with  Life is inevitable suffering  But there are answers along the middle path towards freedom  You will be ok   it took me a long time to get diagnosed b c my parents interfered  I didn't know my symptoms were characteristic of bipolar  I hid things  etc  Yea    me too  I thought people chose to be mopey  That they somehow liked it  Josh  if youre going through hell  keep on going   you might make it out before the devil even knows you're there  Keep hanging in there     You are not alone   No problem bro  You gota know that finding a girl like that wont happen over night  It takes so so so much time  but it is worth it  Being able to find someone you would die for is what keeps me going  Maybe if your emotions switch alot could be a sign of some sort of personality switch thing  Im not a doctor but i have no clue  Get out there dude  If you take one thing from this is that you gota fake it until you make it  Good things happen to all that truly want to love  Youre not alone  sweetheart  Please dont end your life  It can get better  please talk to someone  Talk to us here  I'll listen  I will

with someone scares me   and tbh Im not super motivated  I cant help but think everyone is talking shit about me for some reason  Ive been living by myself for 6 years now and I wasn't feeling all that lonely so I never put a priority dating  but now that I moved and my neighbors are a bunch of college kids  my life feels empty compared to theirs  The thought of meeting a bunch of girls sounds great in a superficial way  but Im not very motivated to do it    Its fucked up  almost like im living my life for someone else or to put on a show  I honestly don't know what I want out of life right now  I honestly just want to drive around and climb mountains  go biking  kayaking  etc but I cant live my life like that without some kind of income Yeah  I'll just echo the therapist  they seem dumb

your two situations  I imagine    based on what other people have told me about their experiences    that once you're in the midst of a full blown psychosis  you aren't going to pause and evaluate  "hey  does what I'm experiencing right now make sense " So I think the prelude to any of this is being able to recognize that you aren't in the most rational frame of mind  Don't be too hard on

prescribed 2x1mg day of xanax because klonopin and valium are useless   I started smoking at 30 for physical health issues  and was diagnosed bipolar at 38  Mostly a daily user throughout that time  predominantly vaping flower  more recently vaping concentrates      A Day in the Life     I woke up one day to an extreme anxiety attack  I took 1mg of xanax and after two hours I still felt no relief  At that point I took a couple small hits from a kush oil cartridge and in 10 minutes I was feeling better  Plus  I'd much rather be a habitual cannabis user than get addicted to benzos   I'm BPII and psychosis has not been a problem for me  nor do I experience any hallucinatory features  whether smoking or not  I experience paranoid delusions  and sativas can definitely make that worse  I generally prefer indicas and hybrids for that reason  and try to avoid straight sativas unless I'm in a really positive mental state and I'm trying to get super faded   If I were predisposed to psychosis  I'd be much more wary  This right here is why I wish I lived in a legal state  or just had better dealer  and could buy only indica   About 3 4 of the time I find it relaxing  but the rest of the time I get a batch that just makes me extremely anxious and paranoid   Luckily he knows about what I got going on and he'll buy it back from me when that happens  but I'd rather just avoid that happening altogether   thanks for your reply  did  you try treatment when you were younger or was that not an option  do you tihnk if  you had started treatment sooner it could have been effective   for me   i never got treatment  but wish i had  i now do a lot of running  and physical activity  that helps  a lot but day to day is  different   exercise is a fantastic hobby to pick up  also does wonders for self confidence and has a branch for everyone  i for instance just started cycling  and its doing wonders  I'm so sorry you're struggling like this  Now is a good time in your life to learn some new coping skills  You probably have all this pressure on you about graduating and it can be so overwhelming  People expect you to have it all figured out after college but really no one does  I don't know how you feel about therapy but a type of therapy called CBT may be really helpful for you  Here is a good summary of what it does  http   blog tranqool com 2016 07 05 a short guide to cognitive behavioural therapy  utm medium Reddit utm source Reddit utm term CBT guide I belong to a historical reenactment society   which I call a gateway hobby lol  From there  I learned to weave  which is my primary hobby within my hobby now  But I also paint silk banners  sew  and fight in armor sometimes  Some of my friends make glass beads  some do leatherwork  some make armor  apparently pounding on metal is relaxing for some people   some do archery  including making arrows and such  Does any of that sound interesting  Wow  thank you so much for taking the time to write to me  This really helps   thank you   Yeah  I don't know if you live rural  urban  or suburban  but a change of scenery can be helpful if it's financially viable  especially if we feel stuck in a place we have so many negative thoughts and feelings towards  Cities tend to have better mental healthcare access than smaller places  and more diverse clubs and groups  so if you've got passions they can be better accommodated and you can build your tribe a bit more  you know what I mean  I grew up in a town of 1000  was bullied and belittled constantly  there was never anything to do and I had to be driven around all the time  I now live in a city of 400k and there's opportunities galore  but sometimes my own self esteem makes it hard to get out and take advantage of them  But yeah  talk about the change of locale with the therapist  see if they think it could be good for you  If you like them  they might even consider skyping or whatever in your new location  This is an awesome attitude  It takes so much strength to choose to fight depression  Just remember to set realistic expectations of yourself to avoid being disappointed and becoming demotivated   I'm awful at math as well  I'm sorry to hear you're having a bad birthday OP  fuck school fuck studying and fuck all those students at my college that humiliated me   Holy shit yes   It feels like more than one for me honestly   But it might just be my mind making that up   Idk I often have a set of morales and beliefs and then the next day or even fucking hour they completely flip   And it's so so hard to try and stay course to the person you're trying to be   For me   anyway    I live in the UK now but I was raised in Germany  I did find it a lot better there one thing I've never been able to do is the weird fake smile thing everyone seems to do when they meet some one  Can't do that to save my life  I haven't worked out in over a week because of the holidays and I really hope I get to the gym tonight   Getting back into a routine  life wise AND gym wise  is difficult   I plan to do my normal weight routine on the selectorized machines and then hopefully jog 30 mins on the treadmill   I really need to get

faces  objects  plants  houses  nature  Even if you don't like the results at the beginning keep going  You will quickly create something you'll like  There is also r ArtFundamentals  that might be helpful   Origami also might be fun  It's not too difficult to learn a view plans  And it's nice to give those to other people    Reading also is always an option  You can download ebooks if you don't want to go to public libraries  You can also start reading comics  digitally  there are many websites  Just google "reading comics online"   Those are less tiring than reading long books  Despair is so much easier    It tortures me daily and I claim I want it gone but when the opportunity comes  and there are many   to try and change things   I don't   It's half assed or I give up   It's just fucking easier     Regardless depression is a state of mind really   No matter if you're life is tip top perfect or if you've had minimal trauma in your life   your brain will still tear you apart    Brains are wild   dude    I can't take much credit for it I got it from the book 5 3 1  I don't do that now but it's got a lot of useful lessons  Please  don't just say this on reddit   Say this

everyone that suffers  My guy does the same  buys it back if it causes me issues   He is sensitive to it because he has issues in his lineage  including one of his sons   He gets it all from the grower so he knows the name and its effects   He always has a report for me on each and usually offers 4 6 strains at a time   Before I got married I grew so I was able to only grow what worked for me  I experience adhedonia from time to time  Your meditations sound so boring to me it's no wonder you don't find pleasure in anything    Have you tried sensory mindfulness  I tend to eat fast and it makes my weight suffer so I focus on mindful eating  Take for instance oatmeal with chia seeds and peanut butter  I focus on the smells  I like the way warm peanut butter smells  I like crunching on the chia seeds and sucking them out of my gums  Oatmeal has a smooth mouth feel and goes down thick  Feels so warm and gooey in my stomach  I do this will most meals I eat  I also think about how that piece of food grew  all the people involved  and ended how up with me    I do long walks in nature and focus on the sounds and smells  I love hearing birds chirp and keep an ever watchful eye to spot a squirrel or chipmunk scurrying around    Have you tried tickling yourself with a feather  It feels so tingly and cool   Your solutions are text book and rigid  Have you tried watching your favourite cartoons from childhood  Maybe watch a mindless slapstick comedy    Exercise is good  I love lifting but they're very controlled environments with no room for spontaneity  How do you feel about rock climbing  Are there any zip lines or outdoor adventure courses nearby  How about a kick boxing class  Maybe try your hand at a dance class  Nothing brings about emotions like moving your body to some salsa or disco    The real problem I think is     I do not like my chosen path that I am on  It doesn't seem like there's anything to look forward to after graduation  What do you want to do after graduating   I really miss being a kid and not having a care in the world I am sick of this life too although I hope things get better for you My last job was miserable   I loved most of the people  even enjoyed what I did  but my boss was a complete asshole   The management were all shady as well  tweaking things on our clients' accounts without telling us  like they'd set their spend limits up  and at the end of every month suddenly they'd start getting more than they wanted and paying more than they had set up for  most of them didn't notice  but when they did they were understandably furious and often canceled  which then reflected on us as account managers because we were paid on retention and revenue      If you ever brought it up the reaction ranged from shrugging at you and saying you should do a better job of selling them on spending more to screaming at you and telling you that you were incompetent for not selling them on spending more   If not for the CEO and VP I'd still be working there  but I wound up finding another  better company to work for doing essentially the same thing but making 3x as much   The management are still not perfect  but the expectations are laid out very clearly and there are no surprises   I'm much happier now     My suggestion would be to keep an ear to the ground for new options   With your experience  you will probably qualify to find a supervisor job somewhere else  and get paid more while doing it  of course  oh my good are you kidding me  i got really shitty days on meds  Every experience is differente   family  meds  therapy  whatever works for you  you have to take every approach to get better It only took me a month to get an official diagnosis   I had one two weeks in from a psychologist but I don't count that   I saw a psychiatrist two weeks after that and got my official diagnosis  I just want to say it looks like marker or tattoos  I don't think it looks bad  But good for making it through  and I hope you keep holding on  Tired and frustrated  and embarassed because I'm coming here for support and haven't given a whole lot  I was diagnosed at 38  It took 8 years of ineffectively treating major depression until a particularly insightful doctor identified it as BPII and got me on the right meds  It's five years later and it has not been perfect  As my doctor puts it  meds don't cure the condition  they try to reduce the severity and frequency of episodes  That helps stay more stable and reduces future neurodegeneration   I think the key is to be open with your doctor  I generally advocate against revealing your suspicions to the doctor so as not to put your finger on the scale  but I'm rethinking that position in light of how long it can take to arrive at a diagnosis  If you think you're in an episode right now  it would be good to have this conversation while you're still showing  and remembering  your symptoms  Thank you very much for your insight  The part that you describe about ADD or as I found it to be named now ADHD  without the hyperactivity and me being an introvert  resembles how I feel about my self and the decisions I usually make  I am so sorry   I have no words  I did get treatment in my late teens  but it was antidepressants and I'be been on and off of them for years now  Might as well be sugar pills    Exercise has been the only thing I would consider remotely effective  If you think it might help then absolutely give it a shot   yep its weird  I have the same feelings   All of mine deal with me being an ass and going off on somebody with some being local politicians and local government   I feel like an ass and I want to get out of this area just for some distance between myself and the issues I have created   Now it is possible that nobody remembers it but in my mind they do and think about it often  My condolences   The amount of people who manage to take their own lives lately is scaring me   There must be something to be done  Things cannot keep working that way  Use sex as a motivation for girls  Love can come or go after but sex is a good starting point  You have a stable income so you have all the opportunities to do the things you want  Just get out there and do it  Don't wait  Your not a kid so you gota use your time wisely before you start to get kids and all that   That's one of those things i'd never wish to happen to a teenager  Ones parent dying  I need to call my father now  I often find the kindest and strongest people are those like us  We can be so sick of life and hate ourselves but we know true empathy  Even though life feels like it's shit   So guess what  you're an amazingly kind person and you'e so strong    Also  I try to watch something funny  Even if we don't laugh  it's nice to see others do it     You'll be okay    Start by cutting things down  If you study only 10 minutes at a time  that's okay  But actually try and study    Go for short ten minute walks  It sounds stupid  but it actually does help   It sounds like you had a really great base to start from due to your hard work  You can find it in yourself to be who you were and build upon that  I think cleaning your living space and giving yourself a fresh start before you start aim to set out what you want achieve is the first step  As this has been going on for 2 yrs dont be afraid to seek professional help too I feel like therapy can't help me  I've been seeing a therapist weekly and haven't seen much improvement  My problems seem to be beyond fixing     The difference is that this time  Im completely aware that my ideas could be considered delusions while at the same time believing that they are true      It's a weird feeling  right     Also  Of  course  you were caught off guard the first time  since you had never been diagnosed  and thus never forearmed   Knowing yourself is so critical  I tend to get a lot worse  in that I'm more prone to believing weird and terrifying things  when I'm under significant stress  and also in winter  It helps just to know that  because I can look back and be like  "Does it make sense that shady government agencies ramp up their efforts to fuck with you every February  Is that like  your designated month in some CIA database  Orrrr are you sliding your belief axis way up while the probability axis remains static  Gotta be the latter  right " And I like that because it doesn't invalidate my fears  but it doesn't let me get away with twisting them out of all proportion either  "This may still be possible  but it's also still unlikely  The fact that you're believing it more is unrelated to the degree of likelihood or risk " Hi  It sounds your therapist is not the best person to you  It is true  that therapists can't make anyone happy  but they are helping people to face their problems that person can build their life better  It's something we just have to make by ourselves  but other people's support on this "journey" is really important  But it sounds your therapist was a kind of rude to you  Can you ask if you can see someone else   And please  Don't say therapy is pointless  cause for somebody it's really effective and important  It's always good to try   I REALLY hope you find someone who can help you  Don't give up  I did something similar   I got it in my head that I needed a new car   A few days later I went into a dealership and financed a  40k car that I couldn't afford   That was ten years ago and I still have the fucker   I won't allow myself to get a new one until this one is in the ground  I would do research  Research  research  research   If you get a jump start and take control of your own mental rewiring process  it will make the whole therapy process a lot smoother and you'll make about 10x as much progress as you would otherwise   That's my advice   I used to want to kill myself all the time and I managed to get over that on my own by basically researching and building my knowledge base and mental tricks   My favorite trick is to simply say "irrelevant" when an oppressive thought comes up  It's a worthless thought  therefore it isn't even worth my time  Sure  it might still make me feel shitty  but I can maintain CONTEMPT for the feeling of shittiness  Depression can suck my ass  basically  When it comes to depression regiments  I notice people are looking for the "miracle" pill more often than not  Therefore  a big part of discussion revolves around nootropics  Most fail to realise that food is a drug  in a way  Different ingredients contain different chemical compounds  such as you mentioned  having different effects on different individuals  given their genetic biochemistry  IMO daily food has a much greater effect on physical and mental wellbeing than taking ginkgo balboa  reishi mushroom  or any other standalone supplement  Until we start paying attention to what we eat  it's hard to establish a baseline from which to then introduce supplements for incremental improvement  I'm a big fan of the elimination diet from which to establish such a baseline  which is supported by your post  For all we know  we're consuming something daily that's poisonous to us  and perhaps is the underlying cause of why we're feeling so shitty to begin with   I miss being a kid too  I was a completely different person  I remember years ago when I first started to get depressed  and I look at myself now and see how it has integrated into my life  and slowly crushed and dulled out any kind of happy person I might have been  Lacking motivation is the worst part  I feel like I've already accepted failing any standard  I'm 22   but motivation is something I still try to fight to find  but always fail miserably      Awesome  thank you for sharing  Do you follow any recipe books or meal plans at all  or do you just have your own meals from the foods you allow  Is this mostly like a paleo diet or keto or something like that  I feel like inflammation is what is effecting my depression the most  since I have crohns disease as well  so I would really be interested in learning more  Thank you so much The first month is gonna suck  Lots of bathroom trips  vomiting and well to be blunt lots of pooping  It was worth it for me  That does sound like it could be fun  but I'm not sure that's for me  I'm glad you've found something that you like though  I'll stick to playing age of empires  Pain is relative  so be nicer to yourself about it  It's how you feel and that's valid enough  It's not about whether you "deserve" to be miserable or not  based on what degree of work you think you've put in to creating a meaningful life  If your external circumstances were different due to your putting in more effort  as you say  you might be happier  but you also might still feel like shit  It's a cliche  but ultimately happiness come from within  I'm sure some of the people you perceive as "halfway up the ladder" are struggling with their own issues of negative self perception  I'm not saying don't try to better your situation  but you have to take care of your inner life first  As to how to do that  I haven't figured it out either  I think sometimes chronic low grade misery is harder to deal with because it's functional and easier to hide  It doesn't force you into making a decision  checking into a hospital  for instance   but can still be hell  It might not make you feel better but I feel stuck too and I'm sending you some love    I will have to take out my yoga mat again  Pick up an instrument  exercise  reading books   these three helped me the most when I'm up or down   thats the spirit    Saame   but  Pandora   I read 2 books recently that I really enjoyed  Aziz ansari's Modern Romance  which honestly made me question my relationship  And "Fuck Feelings"  which is helping me realize my depression is not my fault My cat died while I was going into a depressive episode  and apparently my coping mechanism is creating very morbid jokes that makes everyone else uncomfortable   I live in a suburban area and I want out  I'm seriously starting to doubt if I can even make it to Friday which is my next appointment  I'm very picky about games  but I've been looking  Recently downloaded Age of Empires 2  I know how old school that is though   I mainly use the smoking as self medication because I don't like taking antidepressants  I guess I would say it's my only "hobby" Just like that     I was put on the same dosage of the same medication  but had to come down to 25mg due to the side effects  Had an amazing impact on me for the first 6 months  but now I'm thinking I need to get the dosage raised again  Good luck   I'm 27  almost 28 was diagnosed bipolar ii 10 years ago  and I self medicate with weed  Only difference is im a female  Got a great job but I hate it and want to throw it all away  along with my degree  for something completely different  Don't know what yet  but I find myself stuck   Anyway  I think if you try to open up to other females  you might surprise yourself  Maybe try taking a class on something you're interested in  or joining a club  Sorry if this was a useless post  just wanted you to know that you're not alone  Hi  I'm not sure if I can help you  but I will try  I don't think it's normal to have that kind of effects after two months  cause side effects usually last max a month  Escitalopram surely can cause more anxiousnes first  but I think it's possible that those meds are not suitable for your friend    Try make your friend to go see the doctor  Doctor knows these things better and it can be that he she gives some new meds that hopefully are better to your friend  It could also be nice if you go with your friend to see the doctor in that kind of situation  Support is really important  I took the 10mg version for about 7 months before I started the 20mg  and I never experienced anything like what your friend is experiencing  You should try and get him to go see the doctor  and if he continues to refuse  you should try and convince him to at least call the pharmacist who filled the prescription   I actually had the opposite with my Sertraline  Started taking it  felt some very bad side effects after just 2 dosages  Lots of sweating  overheating  trembling  and more anxiety  Maybe I'm just one of the rare cases of having side effects  but it's something that anybody that starts taking Sertraline should be aware of   Just a bit of formatting advice  erase the " " at the beginning of your post so it's easier tor read I feel the same exact way  Doesn't it just suck  Hmm  I want to give "Fuck Feelings" a try  This society makes us feel so damn guilty for depression   I'm so glad that you enjoyed the writeup      I typically make up my own recipes  as it's difficult to find recipes that oblige to my specific dietary standards  I would say it's a pretty strict Paleo diet with the added step of eliminating nightshade vegetables  I'm not sure what exactly to call it yet    Ugh I'm sorry that you are dealing with Crohn's disease  my aunt has it as well and I know how trying it can be  I think you're probably right in suspecting inflammation as a major contribution to your depression  As a side note  I have eczema which is also an inflammatory disorder and I definitely notice that my eczema flair ups often coincide my mood changes  which are typically a result of my food intake    Would you like me to share a few of my recipes  Are there any foods that you don't like to eat so I can have an idea of what to send   Damn    I feel bad for you  I hope you can go through this and feel happy again  Thank you I'd strongly recommend some  r wholesomememes for some anxiety reducing and kind place  I think the best thing to do is either chat to the person that's currently prescribing your meds or get a second opinion  which you really are entitled to do  There are so many variations and combinations now  in the past you would just be given meds and told to deal with the side effects  Thank for saying that  as I was typing this on my phone frustrated and mad  I waesent even thinking how I worded my scentences   Also related   https   www ncbi nlm nih gov pubmed 24414610  https   www ncbi nlm nih gov pubmed 27475725  http   m pnas org content 106 42 17957 full  Good luck  I have never taken medicine for depression  managed to find ways around it  Exactly  I couldn't have said it better myself    I think that food is too often ignored as a major contribution to how we feel as well as how we function  I have tried over 15 different types of pharmaceutical medications for my bipolar  mainly trying to eliminate the severe depression  and none of them worked  Instead of thinking about my lifestyle  including what I ate  I was diagnosed as 'treatment resistant'  I still struggle sometimes  but I'm more stable and hopeful than I've ever been     For all we know  we're consuming something daily that's poisonous to us  and perhaps is the underlying cause of why we're feeling so shitty to begin with    This is so true  which is why I decided to make this post in the first place  I never would have suspected that gluten  dairy and nightshades were having such a horrible effect on my mood   You aren't  even if we can't be there next to you there is a community here that actually cares  I care  I honestly do because I know how you feel and that is why I don't want you to have to go through it alone   One day everything will be OK and you will be happy  stay strong     Thank you so much  u theironyengine I really appreciate your input  And I love the term "squirty water enhancers "    I actually bought some of those and haven't used them yet  That would be a good thing to try for the new year  Thank you   I was better functioning and unmedicated while I smoked daily  Less dismorphic mania and depression still had wreched mood issues and was unaware of the havoc my emotions were reigning upon my SO  but high functioning  I paid my bills on time  went to school 2 times passed my classes with flying colors  got a great job  put myself in a great position to climb the corporate ladder and all I had to do was take 2 puffs and walk out the door  I wasn't getting "totally baked  dude" just getting enough in my system to keep things buffered  Now I take 5 medications daily that TRY to do what a little bit of weed used to do for me  Bull shit I say    weed helped me  I'm not saying it'll cure or help everyone but for me it's unmistakable how much I benefitted from it  I do  I do believe in karma  but sometimes it doesn't always happen the way we want it to be  Karma always hits me  that trash i forgot to pick up off the floor  Someone's going to lecture me for it and make me feel guilty even though someone just left a pile of trash next to it  I feel like i'm always to blame and have to live in fear and anxiety   while others never have to care for the consequences of their actions  It's weird  and hard to accept   I've had both the copper and the meraina and I didn't notice any issues   We've been altering meds every few weeks but nothing is working  I think medication can't solve my issues  Still holding on for some reason  I think only because I'm afraid of death  Although my mom and therapist say they see improvements I am still not functioning  This isn't mbti  but remember you barely have any cognitive functions strong in you right now  besides your first perceiving function  which is the least relatable to almost all other people  As you get older you will relate more to others  Additionally  as others get older  they will relate more to you   Also  some people can't even function without helping others  Also again  some people would be insulted if they found out you didn't go to them when you needed someone  Yes  you're right and some people would feel burdened  but many people are the opposite of that and wouldn't feel burdened at all  Oh my parents have accepted that  they don't talk to me about religion or church at all anymore   I'm very guilty of using dark humor to cope when depressed   I feel you  I'm the same  Im a senior in HS going into uni as a CS major next fall  Im not ugly or anything  but am a super lonely introvert  I hope to God something changes in uni  but being a CS major makes me have my doubts   I've been unemployed for around two years  I made the worst decision of quitting my job before I found a new one  A month later  my boyfriend broke up with me and I've been on a downward spiral for almost a year and half after that   Mid of November  I got in touch with an ex colleague  and things were looking up  I really really like the guy and we've been texting and meeting up for the past two months  He's been having trouble with work and finally handed his resignation today  The problem is that he's moving back to the US in a few months  I'm not an American  and this has put a but 'IF' on our relationship  He thinks this might not lead anywhere because of his move and is thinking of ending it   It's been a while since I liked a guy this much and I really do think this can go somewhere  The thought of him breaking this off is already hurting me  I don't know what I would feel like if he really does end this  I hope he doesn't  guess I'll have to wait till the end of this week to see what happens   He previously asked me if I would eventually move back with him and I said I'm not really sure I would  I'm not sure I would like it there  Now  not so sure   Wish me luck  I really don't want this to end   He was the only thing keeping me going   Finally taking and accepting Sertraline to help me was one of the best decisions I have ever made  I was in a bad place already and I finally took the courage to go to the GP and ask help  She gave me the same dose  Took 50 mg for 1 year and it was the best  But after a year  I needed to decrease the dosage to 25 mg due to side effects  mine was too much sleeping and couldn't do any work done due to sleeping too much  Hahaha  but at 25 mg  Sertraline is still my bestfriend   I was shocked when I found it  we all think we are the only ones that do it  but we aren't  Hey     I'm going to talk about a couple of broad things here  but PM me if you want to chat in a bit more detail about some of it   My experience with depression  and I think a lot of people will share this view  is that it is something you have regardless of how you are feeling  So even if you are joyous  you still have depression are depressed  I mention this because I think it will help to clarify the way you look at the condition  Especially because you said you are motivated for the first month of study and then fall into depression  I think it will help you to rather look at that fall as an expected and manageable change of emotion as opposed to a 'fuck it  now what ' moment   But visiting a psychiatrist is an excellent choice  and I agree that it's scary to start with  Just remember that it's not their job to judge you or your decisions  they're there to help you understand why you made them  And ultimately it's your decision to speak about something or not  but obviously the less you engage the less they will be able to help  Neither my parents ever understood my depression  Dad passed away a few years ago so it's just mum now and she's seen me go through a serious rough patch   cutting  hospital  stitches   but she still doesn't really understand the depth of the things that affect me  Sometimes it's just a case of giving them time to understand or finding another way of explaining yourself  Which is hard  A really lame example is my introversion  My mom is a hairdresser and after one really busy day she said she was exhausted but filled with energy after interacting with all her clients  I told her I feel the exact opposite  social interactions also exhaust me but they leave me feeling down and dark too  It was the first time she started to comprehend how I feel about socialising    I can keep going about everything else you've said too  but let me leave it here  because maybe you think I'm talking total shit so far  Message me if you want to chat  And I'd be happy to read about the other 90 percent of what you want to say    I have Type 1 Bipolar Disorder  and one of the pharmaceuticals that I tried was Lamictal  It didn't work for me and I experienced negative side effects  but nonetheless  it could work for you  Here are a couple articles I've found on the topic     This  https   www ncbi nlm nih gov pubmed 22322995  article is a review which states that lamotrigine seemed to benefit people with borderline personality disorder as well as people with anxiety disorders    This  https   www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles PMC3628173   article states that antiseizure medications are helpful for the treatment of anxiety disorders  They are increasingly being used instead of benzos because of the negative side effects and addictive properties     Lastly  https   www ncbi nlm nih gov pubmed 23945444   this study shows that lamotrigine has been found to provide a benefit to individuals with unipolar depression   I just started too  Side effects are starting to show  otherwise it seems to help with mood quite a bit that's a bit scary but not what I  meant I understand your frustration and am sorry  But please  all this man needs is some support   definitely not a useless post  joining a class or club is a really good idea  Thanks for sharing and responding     Did they 'fix' it for you  Same here  I miss having this 'content' feeling inside me  Everyday is a struggle and sometimes I just think it would be easier to end it all  I really do miss being happy  Or content at least   Just stay calm lil buddy  You should start taking down how it affects you  Present how you feel to your doctor  You aren't trapped taking them and you can get off them if they don't help  If you feel like medicine could help but the one your on doesn't seem to work  Talk about it  Different one's affect different people in many ways  Good luck on life  hugs  I don't know any of you  but I've never felt a greater urge for some strangers to be happy  I want you to be happy  I love you  Thank you  Like many others have said please spread the truth  Call out people who say those things  I admit I was one of them until my disease kicked in  I really wish society would separate the words Depressed  depression from sadness  or at least come up with a more clinical term for this illness   Thankfully mine was is all inward facing so I don't have sex to satisfy the urges   Instead  I have masturbated everywhere you can think of including cubicles  public bathrooms  and even while driving on the highway   The worst part is that  due to it being inward facing  I have no need for sex with my wife and that doesn't sit well with her  understandably  This might not be the greatest view ever and certainly won't work for everyone  so just keep that in mind   I'm a total existentialist and I'm quite firmly of the opinion that life is pointless  absolutely without meaning  As are our lives  But it is in that meaningless void that I do  in fact  find purpose  I immerse myself in my work   I just want to help people so even if I can smile at a supermarket teller and have them smile back at me I feel like I've made a little difference   I'm not suggesting you adopt a position like mine  but maybe start basic  Instead of looking at your life in the greater scheme of things rather focus today on looking for a job  Maybe tomorrow it's simpler  whatever  When you realise that you're able to constantly reassess where you are and what you're doing in life then you'll be able to think about the big picture  Be careful with your goals  you say you want more out of life but what does that mean  You might end up with a boat piloted by little robots  but that will still leave you feeling empty because you don't actually know if that's what you wanted  So find the meaning in what you're doing today  have a purpose that you can achieve quickly  and go from there  They take a few weeks before having an effect Sauce  I've been on zoloft for 3 months Be patient  it takes a little bit to feel the effects  I'm proud of you  I found the hardest part of the whole process was mustering up the courage to get meds  So good job and I hope you're feeling better soon   If there is  i cant think of it   I don't have an outlet like that anymore   yeah it's really weird and confusing  You aren't a disappointment  Depression makes people irritable and people who are depressed tend to seclude themselves  They don't enjoy things like they used to  It can get better  If she knows you have depression  I am sure she understands  For a mother  it is hard to see her child go through such a difficult thing  You can get put on meds or if you are not in favour of that  you can try other methods to help with your depression and things can be good  It is not your fault   I usually would have an anxiety attack and then get nausea but this is backwards  I'm wondering if the nausea is triggering the anxiety  The nausea begins once I've completed my routine  no matter how much time I spend   then I have the anxiety  I can deal with the anxiety but I just don't want to throw up at the gym   Not on any medications  been off ssri meds for a year now   Only supplement is creatine which is a recent addition   There are so many different ways to trouble shoot this I'm actually very optimistic   I'm gonna try to drink less water tonight and maybe spend more time between sets tomorrow  Just make one change at a time until I can zero in on the culprit  I'm here  talk to me I know how that is  I'm sorry   Do you live near a university  Many offer free community therapy programs  You'd be talking with a student  but it might be better than nothing at all  I just want to say I read your post and I hear you  At least this very moment you are not alone  I feel your pain and understand what you're going through  I'm not going to make this about me but trust me that I know how you feel  I will not dare telling you what to do I just want you know that at least right now you are not alone and at least one person understands you   I'm not much of a hugger anymore  but I'd give you one of my bear hugs right now if I could  Breathe deep  No dude  you'll be fine  Obviously you'll need to start confronting your symptoms a bit more but I promise you won't turn into a maniac tearing people apart for their next fix    First thing I'd avise you to do is   get rid of that gun    Seriously  you should not have something like that at home   Now  you clearly have every reason to be depressed  You had a rough life since the very beginning  But there's one thing I think you should consider  do you really hate your current situation or is it your outlook on life in general  You said you feel like another relationship or another job wouldn't change anything  so maybe it is the depression making everything shitty  It might not be  maybe you should push forward and look for new opportunities  Hell  it could even be both    How much do you talk to your wife  Does she know about all this  A relationship doesn't exist in a vacuum  The two of you can make an effort to find more things in common  take up new hobbies  explore new things in bed  If you're not leaving her  maybe you could try to breathe new life in the relation  At worst  it would help you understand what is wrong with it and what you are looking for   Also  I know being hospitalised is not a trivial matter  by maybe you should actually seek it  If you went as far as buying a gun  your suicidal thoughts are probably very severe  you should not be afraid to be helped  Give it some time but you have just taken an amazing first step  Be patient with potential side effects but make sure you are talking to your prescribing doctor about them because it can take a bit to find the right pill dose  SSRIs generally take weeks to months for therapeutic effects  Just be patient and keep taking it while watching for side effects  Exercise is a great one because it has other amazing benefits for mental health  If you find it a little overwhelming these tips can really help  http   blog tranqool com 2016 10 31 5 tips for making exercise less overwhelming  utm medium Reddit utm source reddit utm term exercise Hi OP  I know exactly how you feel and in fact came across another thread you started which I could have posted almost word for word  This made me create a reddit account in the hope I can help   I have felt like this for years and recently it has become intolerable to the point I have attempted to end things on several occasions  I'm taking medication and seeing a therapist which hasn't resulted in any major improvements  As I'm still thinking of ways to end it   It's awful to be in this position and I've said that I wouldn't wish such feelings on anyone  so I truly hope that things get better for you  Please feel free to drop me a PM and tell me about yourself and if you would like to chat  I hope I can offer some suggested actions which help you   Keep moving forward  inch by inch   This is how it works in SA  it may be slightly different in the UK  You doctor can prescribe anti depressants  normally not all that strong  I think I went on Cilift for a while  They won't expect a follow up but If you wanted to increase you dosage or move onto something stronger you'd need to see a specialist  Hope this helps    What's the fucking point g I'm just gonna fail life anyway  This term is my GCSE thing and I just don't care lol  Everyone wants me to succeed but I don't really care  Rather be dead tbh much more relaxing and nothing to worry about    Not that im worried either but I just get so angry when those therapist people or whatever they're called start giving their opinions    'school isn't an option' 'we just wanna see you come out of school with something' 'just go to school you never use any of those support options we give you'   Man I fucking get it okay but I don't give a fuck what you think  only time I've fucking felt happy in this shitty world is when I smoked a joint for fucks sake what kind of awful life is this   And why is everyone so insistent on getting me to haul my ass to school for some paper    Just don't see the point in living anymore  I almost never feel alive  but when I slipped out on my skateboard into the road I felt adrenaline  Loved that  makes me wanna skate down roads onto oncoming traffic and see how fast I can fucking die  Sounds like a good plan   Creatine can make some people nauseous but if you had it before that addition then it must be something else   I love your username  Depression can really mess with your appetite so maybe it has to do with that  It is also really common to develop an unhealthy association with food  many people start to see at as a form of self punishment  as in they are not worthy of food   Eating healthy can help with these negative associations  Try one of these recipes  http   blog tranqool com 2016 11 14 5 low stress recipes for when you want to be healthy  utm medium Reddit utm source depressionsr utm term social anxiety I haven't tried switching doctor's yet   Too busy getting written out of my family's will and getting kicked out of the house     upvoted for visibility  I don't really have an idea  maybe try calling a local doctor and ask them about the clinics       By googling I found this website http   www freeclinics com sta washington  in the top right corner you can look for more and there is a list  I hope you find help  good luck  Yes and then I realized laughing while crying makes you look insane    Edit   more insane  Keep trying  I felt the same way for so long  I thought things would never change no matter what medications I tried  Now in my clarity I can see it was largely the depression talking  telling me nothing would tame it  Realistically the depression may always be there  but if you keep trying you'll find something that can loosen its control over you  Listen to your mom and therapist too  For me I never felt much different or anything for a long time  but those close to me could see small improvements when I felt none for months before I actually started to notice any real difference myself  It's harder to see from the inside   I truly hope you find the right medication s  to treat your depression  and you feel so much better very soon  It's taken half my life to feel like my depression and anxiety don't completely control me anymore   OP if you really hate school  just quit  I am in college rn and I hated high school  if I had to redo it  I wouldve got a GED and enrolled in community college or online college   School was hell for me  so much busywork  sleep deprivation  and the long ass commute  coupled with lack of friends and loneliness   I graduated frm that place and honestly  I barely learned sht there except that I will never enroll my children in public schools   I suggest you see a psychiatrist first tho because they might prescribe you antidepressants  Thanks for posting this  I've had quite a bit of depression since childhood and quitting gluten had one of the largest impacts towards getting better  Other dietary tweaks were made possible afterwards since I had a much clearer mind and body  Increases in good proteins with every meal and a dramatic increase in fats while keeping carbs on the lower end of things has made the blood sugar fluctuations decrease to a minimal amount   Start small would be my advice  Exercise and reading are both excellent and very easy to pick up  You don't necessarily need to hit the gym  Start with a simple bedroom routine just basic movements nothing intense no weights necessary just your body and working on breathing  Meditation also ties in with exercise particularly the breathing exercises  Hell even try going for a walk or hike  Researching programmes and techniques online should get you into the habit of reading  After that pick up a book or comic  if it's been a while re read a favourite just to get you back into the habit  I'd suggest fiction to begin with because non fiction tend to be way more academic   Listening to music is always a good distraction as well  Hanging out with friends and family as well  Has worked for me when I was in a better frame of mind   I've heard woodworking and lego building can be quite relaxing although never tried it personally  This will get buried  but     About 5 years ago  my MIL that I loved dearly died on Dec 7th after a protracted battle with cancer  My FIL was on antidepressants but it just wasn't enough  My MIL had a beloved dog that we bought her a few years prior to her death  We were hoping the dog's loving presence would help her emotionally  and he did  and all of us fell in love with him  After my MIL died  my FIL was so lost  He insisted my husband and I go out with our friends for New Years Eve like we had planned earlier in the Fall  So with misgivings  we went    On New Years Day my husband received a call from his dad  and he could barely understand him because he was crying so much   This is a family of people that don't express emotion  so him sobbing to his son was unprecedented   Turned out their beloved dog suddenly developed seizures within a week's time and died traumatically at the Vet's office in the wee hours of New Years Day   I will never forget standing there in the parking lot of the restaurant  our friends still seated inside  the wind bitterly cold  the crash of the waves from the coast  as my husband and I cried silently  because we didn't want to upset my FIL  The complete emptiness  staring at the too bright sun and hating everything so  so much  What "loving" god could see a reason in taking a grieving husband's last link with his dead wife  It was literally the worst sequence of events in my life  I became a robot and dissociated from my feelings so I could be the rock my husband needed  but I will never forget the overwhelming tide of pain that ensued when I finally opened myself back up   Fast forward to now  my FIL remarried  there was drama initially   both hubs and I adore this woman  they moved to the country and he is HAPPY  He told me last Christmas that he could never have imagined something this good for himself during the darkest  bitterest time of his life    It's like Sam says to Frodo  how can you go on when there's so much hurt  how could the ending be good  Because the heroes of the stories we love had lots of chances of turning back  but they didn't  They kept going    I want you to keep going  It's what your mom would want  You're not alone in your grief  Good things are still ahead   hugs  Mourn and remember her  but don't stop moving forward   3 Yeah I know of those programs   I got to find a great therapist this year who didn't cost much  and I'd like to find some way to stay with this practice  but that might not be possible  That's shitty  but hold strong  It might sound hokey but try getting some exercise if you can   like get your muscle sore  Once things die down hopefully you can get in to see someone who can offer better help  Thank you very much   u throwban Thats a good way to start  if you want to talk  im here   This is in no way just me promoting a channel  I just want a way to speak how I feel without it being personal with anyone  and I genuinely want to help others  I've just started mine as well  I tried antidepressants like 2 years ago  but didn't take them seriously before and quit after about 2 months  recent events in my life really put me over the edge and I hope they help this time around  Yeah I've had it checked a couple of times  Also been checked for diabeties  viral infections  sleep apnea  various stds  and various blood diseases  Physically I'm pretty healthy  which is good  Just wish I could wake up  Thank you so much for sharing   it's very motivating to hear other people being able to change their brain function based on what they're eating  I'm glad to hear that changing your diet has had such a positive impact on your mood and mental clarity   I've been adding more protein in lately as well  since some days I was barely getting any  and I noticed that it greatly increased my energy  I hope things continue to get better and better for you  At the risk of sounding callous  not your monkeys  not your circus  You don't know her  anything about her  her name  and she's wildly unstable  I pity her but it's not your problem  I am totally going through a similar situation  Your reasons are more than valid for feeling this way   hugs  I haven't had a real depressive episode in the three years I've been taking them  except for the time I was an idiot and stopped because I thought I was cured  Not that things are never hard  but so so much better than they were before You're right  you do sound callous  This isn't some random person   this is someone I spent 2 weeks in partial with   a lot of time out of partial under she started getting paranoid and cut people off  I know a lot about her  I don't know her last name because I was manic when I learned it and I forgot  I've met her mom   but I forgot her name too and never had her number    Do you really think of everything in terms of it's "your problem" or not  If you do  I feel bad for you  Not me  Also  something that I heard on my favorite Podcast   Mental Illness Happy Hour w  Paul Gilmartin   if you are interested  is online therapy  It seems to be a lot less expensive than visiting a brick   mortar therapist    I think the one he promotes is Talk Space   Hello Rachxkitty     You are shattered but you can repair yourself like  Kintsugi  https   en wikipedia org wiki Kintsugi    breaks up are really hard  but they happen to lots of people and almost no one can deal with them  just saying you are not alone     I hope you are going to pull through  it won't just go away  the days are going to be harder  especially the first one  try to occupy your mind but as soon as you are "alone" with your thoughts it might come again  I think you already know that  stay strong              I don't know if you know the butter's quote but it really applies in your case   Butters  http   i imgur com ZccuADU png   granted this is a bit clich  but still             Stay strong  good luck  I used this to explain to someone about my life too   I post about this occasionally though not in this sub and I always get quite a bit of resistance to it  diet is a huge factor in mood and mental state   Diet and exercise have been shown time and again to be two of the most consistent factors in decreasing depression and anxiety  Are they a cure all  no  but if it can get us to a place where we are no longer completely debilitated then that's a big leap in the right direction    hugs  That butters picture made me tear up   Thank you for taking the time to write such a sweet message   It hurts but I'm holding on  I have lifted weights and running for 4 months without skipping days  Not a single day has I been happy doing it  Never felt any accomplishment or mental reward keeping at it  Something has to be seriously wrong with me  since other people say they get better from exercise  You absolutely can  If I was able to get through depression  so can you  gratz bb hope i helped a bit luvya papa bless I feel you   I've had a lot of trouble with anhedonia and it's not easy to address without fixing underlying depression   Here's a couple things to try though    1   Adderall or other simulant ADHD medication   It won't cure the anhedonia but I find them to improve motivation which helps get things done    2   Agmatine is a supplement recommend by the folks over in  r nootropics as having some effect on anhedonia   I've seen some minor decrease from it  I don't know what I'm doing anymore  I feel alone and stupid  So much is happening that I should be excited for  but I'm not okay  I'm not excited   I wanted to share my future with him  I can't quit school  the police shows up in my house and I can get punished if I don't attend it  I talked with my parents today and they said I have to go to school and that they cant do shit   I don't know if I will make it until 2018 honestly  I'm feeling really upset and inferior to everyone else    I'm just hating my life  I am experiencing the same thing for a while  especially not eating a lot  for me I don't want to eat at any structured time  like lunch or tea and it's sometimes pressuring to have certain times set for meals and such so I just eat when I can  it's probably not the best thing but I can't force myself to eat food otherwise I feel sick  but if my stomach rumbles I know I have to eat something  I hope this helps  ask if you need any more help or want any more information  I have Mirena   I barely get periods anymore and they are very light when they do happen    Tell me about it  The amount of resistance I receive whenever I post about non pharmaceutical methods to treat mental disorders is insane  pun not intended   Even though it is heavily sourced  many people seem to ignore it right away  I think there is resistance because people like to eat yummy things and don't want to hear that eliminating said yummy things could make them better  so they dismiss it  However  there are some people who are genuinely curious about it  which I find encouraging    It seems so common sense to me that what you put into your body will have an effect on your mood and cognitive function  I mean  look at the numerous studies coming out that show how intricately connected your gut microbiome is to your mental well being  Diet is just one part of the equation  like you mentioned but you're so right in saying that it can help you get to the point where you can better think and deal with your depression   Thanks  It wasn't easy to try meds they terrify me  Last time I tried them I nearly killed myself several times  And now I'm dangerously close to attempt it again  Reaching out on Reddit seems to help in my worst moments  Reading others and leaving comments reminds me I am not alone  I just want this all over  I hope they even me out sooner rather than later  I'm on my second medication already  And I feel so much worse  I was doing better without them  I might not respond right away  but you can message me  If yo simply never try or find anything you like  things will never get better   If you try they might and probably will in the long run  keep in mind long run  talking months and years  It's really difficult to find yourself   Thank you  I'll check it out  OK I will try doing that when I get my emotions together and stop feeling miserable You're the one who posted  I was in an RTC for 15 months  do you really think I don't know what it's like to answer a call from an old friend in the middle of a psychotic episode  Or worse   Do what you want  call her mom that you met once or find her on Facebook if you're genuinely concerned  When I felt bad about myslef or felt myself sliding downhill to my condition I felt that a strong comfort for me was music  certain bands that I could empathise with were my chemical romance  fall out boy  bring me the horizon  etc  they aren't calming bands but they help me channel my pain and help me reaslise that we are all in the same boat  everyone on this subreddit wants to help everyone else  If you want to talk to someone one on one going to the doctors or someone at your workplace  school college etc is a good place to start  even close friends or family is good too  I hope you feel better soon   Yeah I agree but I am really sick and tired of being the 'invisible' kid in my class the one who no one cares about  I'm glad  I was off of all meds during pregnancy   At some point the OBGYN tried to put me on some medication  mood stabilizer and antidepressant  but the side effects made me too sick to work and I had to work so I just went without the meds   Post partum I got depression and psychosis   It was scary and I almost didn't go back to work and I could have harmed my baby   I was aware of it happening though and called my son's dad to come hold him   Shortly after that I was put on medication   I relate to this a lot  In my head I'm still a kid and I'm having issues trying to adapt to adulthood   Can agree with this post  I use to take adderall in college when I needed to do a big project last minute or study  Now I find it difficult to focus without it  Exact same thing happening with me  All I can hope is it gets better  It fucking hurts more than anything I've ever felt  I wrote a blog about some personal depression feelings I had  This was about 4 years ago  and the response I got was overwhelming  People thanking me and stuff  I thought people would think similar things  but sometimes you just have to do it  To quote Carrie Fisher  "You don't have to wait to be confident  Just do it and eventually the confidence will follow " The best place to go to find the answer to whether you are depressed or not is the doctors  I know it's not a particularly nice thing to do but personally I felt a lot better about just going and being diagnosed  it atleast helped me know what I was dealing with   I know this is a scary time but you can trust doctors they know what's best for people as they are trained to do so   I really hope you feel better soon please message me if you want any more help  You could try boardgames   there's a ton of very cool ones being released every year  much better than things like Monopoly and Risk  You already said you like videogames  well  that's like that except you get to go out and meet people  sit down  have a conversation while you play  I'm actually going over to a friend's later today to play Star Wars  Rebellion which reenacts the entire conflict between the Galactic Empire and the Rebel Alliance  you can freeze Admiral Ackbar in Carbonite  blow up planets with the Death Star  or lead an assault on Coruscant  last game Princess Leia got turned to the Dark Side   It's glorious  amazing fun    Best thing about about board games is that you don't even need to buy anything to get into it  Just show up at a meetup and people will play with you   It's awful  but you probably can't do anything here  If you have no way to reach anyone  your options are limited   And even if you did have this info  it's possible they know     Antidepressants usually take time probably like 4 6 weeks  to work  Don't give up taking them if you don't see any results after your first couple of doses  It  is  true for me  The last 15 years I did uncounted decisions under the influence of social anxiety  Trying to avoid it  trying to beat it  I will never know if anything I decide is done out of a clear mind or subconsciously influenced by my condition  I am unable to know if I am actually able to do or not to do something or if this is just my illness speaking  Is a decision reasonable  Or just to protect myself from fears and pains  Do I actually like that or do I just act like that to please others  Or to be left alone  Looking for the most convenient path instead of being courageous to wage something   And the worst thing is that it kills your personality  I don't have a inner voice anymore  I feel absolutely empty and clueless  Thank you so much for replying I really appreciate it I guess that i feel like a bad mother for not being strong enough and letting myself breakdown and cry  I have to be a rock but im not that strong and i just want to be the best for my kid   I hear what you say about conquering demons  Maybe this person was not the one i needed to keep on becoming a better human  I am taking my medication regularly and feel better  I will make a doctors appointment tomorrow to talk about treatment and join a support group  I really want to get well and overcome these feelings  Thank you for listening    Tell her  I am assuming you have not been diagnosed by a professional and you should seek help  I have told my parents  friends  wife  kids and they accept it  My wife keeps an eye on my pulling away and brings me back  She feels like she failed in your relationship  you need to tell her it isn't her  and it isn't really you either  You may not get all that laughter back but I think you will see at least some  You will both feel better  oh and talk about it every once in awhile   I'm so sorry that you're having such a hard time  Looking back to when I switched from being on Citalopram for years to Prozac  I truly don't know how I made it out alive  Do you by chance have a therapist counselor that you can talk to as well  Thank you    I think you both are lovely and amazing people  Really  you have made a difference today in my day and state of mind  Big hugs and thank yous  It really does  hopfully the first day will be the worst and then it'll feel a bit more predictable   How do I bring this up with my doctor  My girlfriend and I had a beautiful boy together on Dec  23rd  but she wanted to give him up for adoption and I cancelled it  I want to be his father but she's so upset she's taken the kid away to her parents house and her dad will not let me visit either of them    I have done all the legal actions I can  but they take a lot of time  A lot of time for me to realize how I lost my partner in the universe and my son in the same decision  I feel like I'm doing the right thing but God every minute of it hurts and feels very lonely  I'm glad and lucky that I have a supportive family to lean on right now   Just wanted to vent cause it's hard to talk about  thanks for reading  I'm just wondering  are you mad that you lost a friend or are you mad cuz you had feelings for her  I'm no expert but exercise  good sleep pattern  eat healthy  be around postive people  stay away from drink and illegal substances   Edit also have learnt all the above are hard to do in the deep darkest days of depression  Parties are dumb  Dates are dumb  Not having a driving licence  Doesn't matter  This is how my life played out as well  carefree and ignorant child  but grew up alone year after year  I thought it would get better  but now I know better not to be optimistic  We're all alone  That's great  I hope it works out for you  I've been thinking about going to see the doctor because it's not getting better and I don't think I can get out of it on my own  I'm a little worried about side effects  I guess I won't know until I ask   My mom told me to kill myself yesterday and no matter how hard I try to work up the courage to do it  I fail  What's wrong with me    many people seem to ignore it right away   This is directly attributable to the pharma corps and medical community telling people the only way is through a pill  it's slowly changing but good god that change is slow    Anyway  cheers for posting and sourcing all of this I might link back to your post when the need arises if that's ok    No  I've never thought that  Why the fuck would you kill someone just so you can die  If you really want to die so badly  you can do it without taking the life of someone else who has nothing to do with your situation  I have a Mazda as a project car  and my dad has a mazda too  They're bad ass cars if you want luxury or rice  I'm so sorry  I hope you can find a second love You know what works better than anti depressants and usually take 1 2 weeks to work  The "medeterian diet" basically all fruits and veggies and no red meat  Natural vitamins is the best way to balance the chemicals in your brain  Stay away from processed foods and all forms of sugar  eat home cooked meals only  I guarantee this life style will change your mood rapidly after a couple weeks  You should be proud of yourself first of all  Losing weight is a huge thing  You set a goal  you worked HARD for 3 years  THAT is a big deal  It's hard  because we live in a social media world  people are always posting about the "new me" and we see that and think that's how it's supposed to be  I guarantee if you posted your before and after on social media  people would for SURE give you props  Not saying it's the most important thing  but a little praise does wonders for confidence    I understand not feeling good enough  I've struggled with that my entire life  People think I'm confident  athletic and strong willed  but I secretly struggle with not being good enough  But having a little fake confidence can help  Use this weight loss a stepping stone  Go on Tinder  Match and all that stuff  There are millions of women out there  dating is a numbers game  Go on as many dates as you can  and it will stick  Again  the fake confidence will help   Good luck to you man  Congrats on your 3 year journey  Keep making goals and keep inspiring people   If you really can't tell your parents  I suggest trying to make an appointment with your primary care doctor  You can tell the PCP how you're feeling  and they'll be able to point you in the right direction  They will probably also be able to call your parents and explain the situation to them  and hearing it from a doctor will make them take it more seriously  Doctors are your friends  That's just my suggestion    The longer you wait   and the more you take   the harder it will be to stop  Getting anxious when you stop isn't just a reflection of emotional addiction  it's part of the physiological process of withdrawal  In my experience  this process gets all tangled up in BP patterns and swings  It's touchier for us than for most people to come off opiates   I'd recommend getting accountable  with your husband  a GP  a therapist  or someone else  If there isn't anyone you can open up to in your life  think about hitting a 12 step meeting or join us at r OpiatesRecovery   I've been at this for 21years of my life  I fully understand what it takes to live with depression  And even I remind myself that I am powerful  Because that's what we are  Powerful  To live with this shit and keep marching  Keep at it one day one hour one minute  You'll get there  I find it really helps to have a goal that isn't impossible  Can you elaborate  A job  A person  Don't buy so much when you go to the supermarket  only get what you need and make a few changes in your diet  switch out the junk for healthier options  I'm not saying this will cure your depression  but eating healthier will certainly make you feel better and more energetic  This type of thing is a numbers game   You have to communicate with many people   Otherwise all your eggs are in one basket   I have done this because I have met people by chance also  in classes  working in a camp  and then when those were over  I was alone   But it was still on me to continue socializing  If you can manage to do it without the help of medication  exercise   Exercise  sleep  good food    Edit   What u throwawayagain0101 said  But what if you feel like you lost your passion  I always suffer from being able to move on  I usually get crushes on someone and something happens  and I have to cut them out of my life  Eventually I 'get over" them  even though they always have a piece of my heart  But I do stop thinking about them constantly  Well done  Proud of you  that's a big step  Sertraline has really helped me  Give it some time to work and I hope it makes you feel better too  Good luck with it  Am i the only one who is not even able to cry anymore  I haven't genuinely cried in 2 years  My emotions are too numb for that    what is was your passion   I'm moronic and dangerous  Otherwise  I wouldn't be posting to reddit for some hope of mental help  Did you read the post  My title is true based on my situation  If you have it better then good for you  bud  I already hate myself plenty  I don't need your help  Write out a list of all of your achievements since you've worked there  ie  Running the place on your own  customer service  stock checks  management etc etc   Demand a meeting with HR Management and tell them  Give them the list  Let then see how much of a great employee you are    Failing this   1  Brush up your CV  Include every bit of applicable experience in that thing 2  Get that CV out online and begin looking 3  Land another job elsewhere  preferably higher paid with better perks    CV is resume in England    I'm sorry it's not what you wanted to hear probably   The last job I had was good when I started and I realised that my bulimia and depression were spiralling down a huge hole  I was moody  Angry  Every single day  People would laugh and joke with me and I'd snap  and the only thing that kept me going was that paycheck    I left last month and it's amazing how better I feel now  I get paid more  Commute less  I wake up wanting to go to work  well  not really  but who does       Your supervisor is a fucking dick  I respect you for not hospitalising her  I really do  You seem like such a genuine  kind person  Fuck that bitch   Are you male  I cry a LOT around my period  but not at all the other couple weeks  I have a therapist and a pdoc both and they know I have started taking them  I guess I just need some help  and that sucks   I'm sorry you're having such a hard time  Exercise is by no means a complete answer  especially in treatment resistant depression  since there are so many different variables in life   That being said  exercise is the single intervention that has had  the greatest effect  on my depression  However  in my life and probably in yours too  it is only a piece of the puzzle   Everyone is different but learning to live with and even thrive in spite of my depression has been a long and ongoing journey  Some of the tools that have been useful to me in the context of building life enhancing practices into my life one at a time     daily exercise  at least half of it outdoors    daily meditation and at least weekly group meditation    good diet  emphasizing vegetables  plant proteins  fatty fish  fruits  and fats from nuts avocado olive oil and minimizing sugar  wheat  alcohol  and dairy    weekly therapy     antidepressants    supplements including vitamins  probiotics  fish oil  and rhodiola    novelty at least weekly if possible e g  trying a new activity  going a new place  meeting a new person    creative outlets such as journaling  art  music    social interaction at least weekly e g  hiking with friends  board games with friends  can be combined with novelty     purpose  such as thinking about ways your career is important to the world  planning for a shift to a future career that feels purposeful to you  or engaging in volunteering hobby caregiving that brings you some kind of purpose or deeper meaning  can be combined with social interaction     Together all of these might seem like a giant to do list  and sometimes they feel like that  But I also know that taken all together  they make my life much more enjoyable to experience  By implementing them one at a time and building  they feel much more manageable  The list might not look exactly the same for you  but it might be a starting place    Feel free to PM  I have been living with depression for a long time and am always happy to listen   Have done   still diagnosed as Cyclothymic   Thank you so much for responding with this  Despite all the crap I've been posting to this reddit to get it out of my system  reading what you've written actually made me feel a bit proud somehow  Proud  instead of something just suffering and being beaten into the dirt   I also really like this cartoon  It's really amazing  to me  I think I'll print it out and put it somewhere I'll see it all of the time  I cannot agree more regarding the pharma and medical community  I hope that I will be able to do something about it in my lifetime   It would be my honor if you linked back to my post      Thanks for your input  much appreciated   I feel like   I should be able to talk her out of it  But obviously that's not going to happen  yea found that out when i woke up today  Masturbation in general helps though  Haha  thanks Dr  Hooha  Are you by any chance an OB GYN   It's probably because your subconscious is portraying how you want to be happy  because in reality you aren't happy  I'm not very knowledgeable when it comes to dreams  but I'm sure that's what it means   There is a person in my life who makes me very unhappy  When this person was in my dream  we were very happy together  I dreamt of this not because it will come true  it's because it's what I desire  Yeah exactly  Don't come running to us when your life goes tits up  Yeah  I guess she was making me happy and when we stopped talking that much and that often it had a big effect on me   I've had pleasant surprise with my first pill  escitalopram   it worked immediately  I guess my condition wasn't too severe and or autosuggestion of receiving support worked wonders  But taking the pill took some ego fighting I understand how it's super difficult to look for another job while recovering rom daily labor   However it looks like that's what you gotta do   Sorry  that sucks    Just you wait untill we have technology to scan outselves and USE VR to drink together      Deathrow is a long wait   unless you want the police to gun you down   I've been a vegetarian for a year now  and I cannot confirm your "guarantee"  I'm sorry  I wish just eating something else could cure depression  but unfortunately it doesn't work that way   Also  OP  good luck  I've yet to come to the point where I can persuade myself to take medication  do anything  honestly  I'm kinda in the same place as you at the moment  and would suggest going to your family doctor  a walk in clinic  anyone you feel comfortable talking to  You can even talk to me anonymously if you like  From there  people will direct you to resources that are more specific to your situation   You can also take this test  http   patient info doctor patient health questionnaire phq 9  sorry I have no idea how to link this in a fancy way   It's a good one  everyone's been making me take it Good for you  taking steps to get better  You "sound" pretty normal to me  I don't want to insult or anything  but after being in such hell you can't just randomly get a "good job" and marry a man "of your dreams"      A anyway  if what you wrote is true  i don't think you can do anything that will be of real use  Seems like you have everything you want right now  at this point only time will grind the memory  you only need to keep yourself busy and  despite what a shitty road you had  you are at a very good point right now      And yes talking about it  but only sometimes  is a right way to go  Because talking about it will bring back memories and you should   "feel" how you react to it  If its too bothering   try it later  The more mundane undisturbing those thougts are   the better  And you would know better than OP's doctor  Solid suggestion if someone came here looking for non medical options  not sarcasm   but that's not what OP came here for  You don't know anything about OP's background or medical history  Don't try to say that a diet that may have worked for you or anyone you know will be better for someone you don't know anything about  We really don't know how bad it will be  maybe we'll want to make it  I wish that we all make it    Music  I'm training to be a professional Jazz Trombonist and I haven't played in almost a month   What does matter then  Meditation  positive self talk  hanging out with friends  push ups  accomplishing something that impresses yourself  It does  thank you  I post here and a couple other venting subs from time to time  I would be gone long ago if it wasn't so hard to commit suicide   Attempting to scare individuals into staying away from or stopping medication is entirely inappropriate here  Depression is a medical condition and no one here is qualified to treat it  that is what medical professionals are for  That is why we do not allow anyone to advocate for or against specific treatments    If you want to discuss the efficacy of a certain class of drug  or a specific drug  there are subreddits where it is appropriate to do so  such as  r science   r psychology  or  r psychiatry   This subreddit is here for peer support for those struggling with depression   I do  But I also have IBS and GERD and an assortment of other digestive issues  So usually eating leads to discomfort in some form   I can relate  I am also unemployed at the moment  I got screwed over  I have a job interview tomorrow  so hope that turns a new leaf  I was in college last spring  My options for girls dwindled after leaving  as if there were too many at the little technical college I went to  Not having a job  trust me  makes depression so much worse  We sit at home  sleep  wake up  and repeat  It makes you feel worthless  and it makes having bills and loans to pay even worse  Luckily I had a good stack of cash when I fell under unemployment  Hopefully things change for me and you friend  I have to run out of the house for the next few hours but if you send me a pm ill make sure to get back to you then  Stay strong friend  I fall into it sometimes  I'm mostly depressive though  but sometimes I end up with a sweet  expensive leather journal when I know I like typing better    It might be that you don't have much money to begin with because you're spending a butt ton of it    I'm gonna try out recognizing that I'm manic and not making purchases then  I hope you find a way out of it   I absolutely don't scare individual to stay away from medication  In facts I only advise to change class of antidepresants   I only advise to stay away from an overrated  proved ineffective and proved to cause permanent damages worst than depression  ie pssd  class of medication called SSRI SNRI   Than you anyway  I will post message also in those subreddit  Why  You must be very good to be training professionally  is it just kind of like me  that you dont really see the point anymore  Or something else   It just doesn't feel the same anymore  And like you said yourself  I'm not proud of my work  I felt ashamed every time I had to play for my classes  I'm just so disastrously lost  Yeah the combination of the two is overwhelming  I want it to end so desperately   Hmm  possibly doing something meaningful  Back and biceps today  Looking forward to getting back into my routine but it's been hard lately  Too many excuses    Kinda put off the gym past few days  Fell into that vicious cycle of temporary distractions that don't better me at all  rather that actually working towards happiness    But it's all progress    baby steps  right   Hey Panda  It's going to take some weeks before you feel the effects so don't write of the Sertaline if you feel better in the first few days then down after   I'd also like to state that Sertaline is an SSRI  which means that it is a Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor   It won't magically produce Serotonin  the "happy" neurotransmitter  but the Sertaline will maintain a concentration of Serotonin in the synapse   Once you start feeling consistently better and feel like you have the energy to do so  it is important that you get sunlight  proper sleep  exercise  and eat foods containing tryptophan   This will ensure you maintain a proper supply of serotonin   Since the SSRI prevents the reuptake of serotonin  there is increased opportunity for the serotonin in the synapse to be broken down by enzymes   If the neurotransmitter is broken down  it can't be recycled through reuptake   Medicine provides the alleviation of symptoms  allowing you to improve all aspects of your life   I wish you the best of luck  Its nice to see people that can relate and provide understanding  I hope you get that job  Good luck All day exercising  Wearing a weight vest all day doesn't seem very productive unless you just seek to make everyday activities more difficult   I was scared taking mine for the first time too  You probably won't feel any effects for a few days  It works fairly slowly  but if you find the right medicine  you may have to switch a few times  and the right dose  it makes a world of difference  I'm proud of you  and you should be proud of yourself  too      That's a difficult place to be       Sounds like  even though everything in your wants to do  something   there's really nothing you can do in a tangible sense   It's at these points that all you can do is send positive energy  or whatever spiritual terms you follow  to your friend and hope that she stabilizes safely   Regardless  it really sucks you're in this position   I'm glad you posted here and hope you find some comfort in the replies  It's amazing really  how heavy a heart can feel when it's been weighted down by depression   Dude  We literally wake up blind and have to put plates of glass in front of our eyes to keep from walking into things  If anything that makes me feel worse than everyone else  and contributes to my low self esteem and literal depression  not a depressed feeling I get from assuming others' dispositions based on their appearance  Edit  please tell me this is a joke  Thank you for this post  texts with sources are the best  I had heard of most of these studies and concepts and I have tried different diets before  Gluten free diet helps my IBS noticeably but sadly it doesn't seem to prevent depressive episodes  I am on mobile so I can't link right now  but have you heard of the claim that rice and corn are cross reactants  I hope that is the word   to gluten  so they should also be eliminated from the diet if one wishes to be truly gluten free  What do you think of this    Also I would love to hear about the other factors that help you manage your mood  Which medications have you found the most helpful in your case   Hey it's never too late to change  There are many people in similar situations  and many of them will still get somewhere  while others won't  it's up to you  Concentrate on your future  past doesn't exist anymore  I've somewhat experienced what you describe  on days where i attempt this "fasted exercising" i hear people getting results from   It just doesn't work for me  I feel nauseous  light headed  and it gets me into panic mode because i just don't feel right   As your PT is suggesting  i'd agree diet could be a contributor   Try starting the day with proper breakfast  For me  bacon and eggs is my go to  Good essential proteins and fats  low carbs  I'll generally get hungry again an hour or two later  where i'll have some muesli or oats or some form of low gi carbohydrate   Then with this in my system  an hour or two later i'll hit the gym   Good luck  Everyones body responds to nutrient timing differently  i hope you find your balance    Be careful  I self medicate with food and totally let myself go the past few years and can't believe how heavy I am now  It's so hard to resist  food is always there when you need it  not like friends or other things that are out of your control  It's not a good trade off in the end though  once you don't like how you look and clothes don't fit  then it's just something else to be depressed about     I only advise to change class of antidepresants  I only advise to stay away from  Advising to stay away from  any  specific treatment  or to follow any specific treatment  is breaking subreddit rules  You cannot tell people to change their medication here   Same here  Introversion has its benefits  but damn if it isn't something that keeps you from potentially great people  It's also good to know that there are female 20  I'm 22 myself  something's who share the struggle guys do  Most of the time it's just us  seeing as we are supposed to be the hunters  I love board games  In the middle of a game of life right now    Ah I'm sure  and I don't always eat unhealthy  It's just the abundance that's the concern   Sorry     for the freak out   That is "up" me  without a testosterone blocker   Moral of story   Take your meds   That's gonna get old     still can't sleep though   update  blood tests came back and T was fully suppressed at the time  the blocker didn't fail  mania beat my stress management  and then went after me   I'm so glad I don't work around other people     So get a new one  Experiment with weird shit  Trust me  you wouldn't want it this way either  Don't get me wrong  she means the world to me  but that's also why it will always hurt  I've known her over 3 years  She liked me at one point  but ofc that was when I didn't really like her  She grew on me  and that's the worst part about it  Also  She's in NC  I'm stuck in Ohio    I think i can relate and I'm sorry it feels hopeless OP  Does this sound familiar   You hear someone talking about when they "had" depression  like in the past tense  and you're like  "Lol wut you mean it went away  Hah yeah right " It's not you  Good friends are almost impossible to find these days  I've known one friend for close to ten years now and we talk constantly and lately I've been realizing that as the holidays came around they haven't said anything to me in 3  weeks despite knowing how they are pretty much my only contact in the world  People just don't care  I suppose it's possible to overburden people if you were going overboard telling them about your problems  but they shouldn't give an open invitation like that then  Try not to take the behavior as others as a reflection of your own value  Them flaking out defines them as a friend and as a person  not you   When I was a child  I remember I had some moments of being happy  But when I started school  I moved around a lot and I would never fit in  I've carried this sadness and self loathing with me for years  My mom took me to a therapist once when I was 11  Only could do one session as our medical aid would not cover the expenses   Now I'm 30  Still living with this sadness  I wish I could have gotten the help when I was younger  I feel it's just too late for me   It's not much  but I'm sending you internet hugs  You know you have a rough road ahead and you're brave for facing it  Use your resources  And tell your husband  Mine repeatedly tells me he would rather know when things are bad than have to guess  He has depression and anxiety too  and he tells me the guessing game is a bit of a trigger  Stay strong  Guitar  From my own example  it helped me through some hard times  Having a bad day today as well  please know you are not alone  I've been down this road before with my finance courses  often finishing a project that I had 3 months to do in a day     Its a hard road but I just kept pushing myself knowing that it will be finished whether it will look good or not  Getting something done is really better than nothing in my opinion  Do your best and feel good about what you get done  not about how much you put the work off  Hope this helps a little That's just messed up man Thank you  I think it was mostly the toxic relationship I had with my parents add to that the stress of school  and I've had two relationships which weren't good for me  I think the second one triggered this the most out of everything  She made me feel worthless  What about you  Having a bit of a block in a creative passion isn't something to be ashamed of  It may just mean that you really care which is a quality that a great musician needs  Have you tried opening up to people in your classes  I started taking antidepressants when I was in middle school and was on them through high school then on and off through my first two years of college  But now I'm starting to realize that antidepressants aren't for me so I've stopped taking them altogether and have resorted to things like yoga and making art when I feel a depressive episode coming on   Seems like a middle ground option would be to try to discuss how you are feeling with your family  rather than just deciding to stop attending church and letting the consequences play out  or continuing to force yourself to go when you don't want to be there  It's not selfish to have your own identity and to realize when a certain environment doesn't feel right to you  Hopefully your family would only want you to be in attendance at church if that's what you are freely choosing to do  Being there by force or obligation doesn't accomplish much  like you said you're already messing with your phone the entire time    If your family isn't approachable like that were you could discuss this feeling with them  then you may have to just do what feels right for you and deal with the consequences  You can try to encourage your brother to keep attending and not follow in your footsteps  Tell him you are just taking some time away to decide how you feel about it and that he should keep going   I've been depressed most of my life  Lately I have made a lot of progress recognizing my depression for what it is but I still have bad days  Today is one of them  I also feel hopeless and unhappy but I rationally know that this too shall pass  So just know   you aren't alone  I'm here too and I'm sending you hugs and good vibes  Life is much better when you know you aren't alone  Xoxox I can't speak for Lexapro specifically  but I can say that the Sertraline I take can definitely make me feel ill if I miss a dose  but I've definitely never felt 'unstable'  I believe some people can experience negative symptoms because of antidepressants  but anything too serious  aside from allergic reactions  is very rare  As long as you keep your doctor informed about any possible side effects  everything should be fine   Mindfulness  excersize  healthy food  Yesterday I was half a day late on taking my 50 mg and I felt horribly sick  with nausea and vertigo  and wasn't sure if it was food poisoning or the medicine  Wow  this stuff really doesn't screw around when you forget it  How you Doing man  What kinda pastries you make  MIT OCW did me well for this  Usually it just takes the willpower and discipline to decide to do something even when you don't feel like it  So many people think life is this game of being helpless until you find yourself in a better mood  until energy and motivation are just suddenly present some morning when you wake up  but in the meantime while you're just waiting for it to happen on its own you continue to exist in a low energy state of sitting around breathing stale air  and that isn't likely to lead to an increase in energy  More often what works is forcing yourself to get up and do what you need to do  even if you just go briskly walk around the block  and getting your heart pumping and some oxygen flowing to your brain will be the thing that actually makes you feel alive and snapped out of the funk    You're at the mercy of your biochemistry if you go through life waiting for moods to strike you  Instead you kind of have to drag your brain along for the ride  even if it's kicking and screaming that it doesn't want to   Yes switch therapists  Medication is a viable option to help you control depression  If your therapist isn't willing to explore all options  especially one that you wish to explore    change  therapy is about you   not the therapist  I think what the above commenter is trying to say is that you have a right to feel what you are feeling  It's not a competition in that while I may have a hundred different reasons for feeling the way I do  and you only have 98  your feelings are still valid  Sometimes people's brains malfunction and don't produce enough of the chemicals that make us feel good  that means you don't need a concrete absolute reason  you need support and help  Just like someone who doesn't have enough iron in their blood  or the ability to produce insulin  You feel what you feel  not matter if there is a reason or not  You are a human and you have worth  You deserve to feel normal  You deserve the help and support and whatever it needs to bring you back to a level you are happy with   Similat situation here but im not in school  I can't watch movies OT have much of a conversation with someone as mind is restless  adhhd mixed with depression is nasty  which comes first  hard to say  no clue how to fix this I believe they can but I also think that depression itself can affect your memory  Have you considered that maybe you have developed an addiction to feeling negative towards yourself    It's like a fat person eating cake  They know it's bad for them but their brain will release dopamine by eating it to satisfy their addiction   I find a good thing to remember is that I am not my thoughts  If I am my thoughts  who is listening to them  Thoughts and feelings come and go like waves crashing and receding on a beach   It's futile to fight them and resist them  just as it's impossible to hold on to them forever  They will arise naturally  positive or negative  but the trick is to just observe them without judgement   If your thoughts are ranting and raving about negative things  pretend you are watching a child have a tantrum in the supermarket  You don't react  you just smile and know that their behaviour is just silly   If your thoughts become more positive and helpful  that's great  but trying to hold on them will prove just as futile   All anyone has is this current moment right now  this very point in time  All the past and all the future lives in the realm of imagination   So relax  Watch your thoughts rather than react to them  Smile at the negativity with detachment and embrace the positive ones just the same  Everything will be fine  No  Don't listen to that bullshit  Try and make some small changes  Go for a walk around the block before you play video games  It might help  Do not kill yourself  Please  For me  Do  Not  I love you  Everyone here loves you  Please don't   I know what you mean  I have been there so often with school  starting off ok and then failing later on  getting 20s and 30s on my midterms finals because even though I try to study  nothing sticks  That is a normal thing with depression  If you need to take some time off school  that's totally fine  It will get better  I promise  even if you don't believe that   I know saying it doesn't help  Would it feel a little less horrible if you knew you had time to get better    I took last semester off because I was failing from the third week due to symptoms  I have bipolar so I get really depressed but also manic   I am planning to go back soon and the time off has definitely been helpful even if I'm not perfect yet  I am not depressed now because I take the pills  We'll be thankful you can enjoy people's company and feel close to people to where you miss them when they go  I don't even have that so its ah very empty existence   empty for me  not lonely Why don't you talk to your physician or psychiatrist instead of a dietician   You know what  when you write it out I now understand what I'm feeling  Brain fog  That's exactly what it is  The other ones I feel as well  but brain fog is what breaks my brain in half   The next step would be to seek a psychiatrist    Just look for one nearby and schedule an appointment   http   finder psychiatry org   https   www zocdoc com psychiatrists   They will listen to your problems and give you advice and if they suspect you have depression  they will prescribe antidepressants   Also  a psychiatrist will provide you a diagnosis so if you miss school  you can use your diagnosis to provide an excuse     Im going to my first psychiatrist appointment in a couple of weeks and I wish I had went sooner    I hope you see one too    You are such a sweet person  my god   I don't have any friends  I don't really fit in  The only people who get my personality are the ones who've known me for years  Everyone else just thinks that I'm awkward and different  Very true  one must keep throwing themselves out there in social situations  it could very well take awhile to meet someone worthwhile  you are in college though so you are in the perfect time to make friends   Knitting  There's a bit of a learning curve to get started  but once you do  it's nice and mindless and keeps you busy  I talk with them  but the dietician told me about it first  He said to me he made the diet like that because ssri's can cause memory loss  Brain fog  racing thoughts  exhaustion  restlessness  inability tonenjoy pretty much anything so it's vry hard to get a handle on it There will always be times in your life when you will be alone and this is found was when things used to pile on top of me fast and everything went down hill  I eventually just tried to be happy being alone or to keep myself entertained  It didn't work all the time but it definitely helped take the edge off it a bit  People can help you to not feel alone but I've also been stood in a room full of family and friends and felt more alone then ever   Try to focus more on what you can do to pass time when you feel alone and maybe in taking up new hobbies you will find like minded people to share your alone time with  By caring about others  Call your mom ask her how she's doing  Or text a friend asking them about their    whatever they care about  Make connections  That's how you stop feeling alone   Found this there now  Kinda hits home  Thanks for sharing  Well done on expressing that  I can understand how hard that must have been for you      "Sensitive is how I was made " Personally I can relate to this  There were times when all a teacher had to do was give me an angry look and i would be close to tears haha  I have OCD myself and can relate to checking myself in the mirror  i  Its good to know you are doing better  As for the whole telling friends thing  I was and stil am afraid of telling friends about my OCD  I told some friends I only knew after a few months and wasnt sure if i had made a mistake or not haha  Al in all  thanks for the post     Why not see about volunteering some time to talking with elderly people or at a homeless shelter or anything like that  It will be a great distraction for you and on some of the peoples cases you meet you could mean a hell of a lot to them  That should help to shift the "worthless" feeling  Unfortunately i'm stuck in the same limbo you are  Everyone around me seems to want me to "figure out what to do with my life" but I doubt they would accept my answer of nothing  Idk about you but I just can't seem to find interest in many things  I'm not good with advice but I suppose I could recommend you to see a course counselor to maybe figure out your interests first   Have to reclaim your power again  If you felt very serious about that girl it's possible to be pretty deeply wrecked by the betrayal of cheating and the end of a relationship  You didn't mention how long the relationship lasted  unless I missed it   but regardless after a year and a half it's time to be moving on  I understand that can be hard when you got a job in a location that reminds you of her  but you can do it   If anything your story should prove to you that you turned your life around once and you can do it again  You accomplished things that you previously believed were impossible  just like you seem to be believing now that it's impossible to ever reclaim what you once had    One situation with a disloyal girl through you way off track  Learn whatever lesson you can from it and move on  You don't have to be guarded and cynical  it actually requires more strength to let your heart remain open and still welcome people into your life  but now you know that to some extent you always have to remain on solid ground in the relationship with yourself and who you are  because people will come and people will go  So many people let a satisfying relationship become their entire identity  and you'll never totally protect yourself from being hurt if and when it does come to an end  but you wanna be able to see the bright side of life and get moving again faster than 18 months    I know what I'm writing doesn't exactly equate to practical A  B  C advice about what you need to do  It's a personal thing that you'll have to decide for yourself  Start hitting the gym again  put up a dating profile and meet some new people so you can stop ruminating on the past  whatever it might be   It's rather mean to tell someone to be thankful for pain     Everyone has hard things to deal with   Just because their difficulties are something you like the look of doesn't mean the grass is greener     Empty and pain are two different problems   Don't act like he should be thankful  If we went down that road  we'd all need to be thankful we aren't child slaves and raped and beaten everyday    i feel similar It might be obvious but you might be forced to take psychiatry medications if you weren't aware  wrong dr  get out of there  Healthcare system is a fucking joke  i don't think that's an antipsychotic You don't have to do anything meaningful with your life   Your purpose might not have anything to do with a career  or modern societal expectations  your purpose may just be to exist     What i'm failing to say is  do what you have to do  to support doing what you love  A career can just be a means of money   Not everyone has something they've wanted to be since they were 6      I'm becoming a nurse because I can make 30  an hour and only work 3 days a week   That leaves me with 4 days to write books  which is the thing i'm passionate about    thanks for replying  should have been more clear  i'm not necessarily hung up on the girl  i'm hung up on the move  I made a horrible decision that I have to live through every day just by being here  Thank you   Thank you  I will look for more options tomorrow  abilify is an antipsychotic Sorry you're hurting  I too was one of those unlucky people who didn't feel drawn to a career or certain direction in life  I chose the one that seemed the most reasonable to me  automotive  and worked in that for a few years before deciding I hated it  Now I'm still lost and closer to 30    If you haven't even started college yet you still have time  People change majors all the time  Sadly there's no magic answer  You'll have to do self analysis and try to figure out what you could do that would satisfy you  fulfill some need in the world  help other people  make you the type of money you want to earn    whatever context you need to use to try to come up with something   I know when I took anti psychotics I definitely had memory loss and basically I was a zombie  Actually zoloft and Prozac made me feel that way too  Now I take only effexor and I feel like myself and I don't have any noticeable memory problems  Medication works differently for everyone and I can only speak from my experience  Maybe you could try some different meds  You seem to be much more energetic currently  Are you still feeling the effects of the stimulants  when I was in elementary school I was afraid of being run over  or the world ending  and me dying  Nowadays when I walk across the street I silently pray that I get hit  that way it wouldn't be my fault  You should look at it in a way that makes you proud of the fact you have higher standards then most and aren't going jumping into bed with anyone just because it's been while   I can't encourage anorexia  I know what it's like to have difficulty eating  though  Plan high calorie meals like protein bars or shakes  Make sure you have at least 3 a day   But they help me     I used to know everything about my hobbies    Now I can't even remember the scorers of the football games that I have watched 2 months ago    "Everyone goes through depression at some point "  False   Some people have depression and some people have feelings of sadness that go away   Catch 22 because weed is the only thing that makes me feel normal and the majority of my true friends and my family don't support it   Plus it doesn't fix everything I still am depressed just depressed and high     I feel hopeless  like nothing will ever fix it    Sadly it's one big chain reaction  People hurt others because of the ways they've been hurt before  You can only try to break the chain by not being the next link  Try not to let the way people treat you change the way you treat others  Try to not take it personally but understanding everyone is just broken and lonely and struggling and don't take the behavior of others as an assessment of your own value  If some totally random person walked up to you on the street and attacked you  I hope you'd be more likely to assume it was some crazy person out of their mind rather than "my god  what did I do to provoke that "  You have to try to look at other situations like that to  Someone being rude to you or disappointing you in some way doesn't necessarily mean you did anything  It's healthy and mature to try to ask yourself if you did anything to cause it  but you don't want to cross that line so far that you seek ways to blame yourself when you didn't cause it   What happened exactly  Try several offices  Try to also get in with a therapist  Start with your GP for meds  They can at least get you started on an antidepressant before you see the psychiatrist  It takes a long time for them to work anyways  so it would be a good starting point   Okay  Why do you think that they don't believe you  The issue for me is shakes do nothing  Maybe they give me nutrition  bu the pain stays  and that's what Im trying to get rid of  I'm not anorexic as I'm not doing it to lose or even maintain my weight  I just wanna do it so I can manage on small amounts of food Thank you  She wished me a Merry Christmas through text on Christmas  And a happy new year today  Do I ignore it  Do I tell her to go screw around with her new boy toy  Do I tell her how she hurt me   Ok  Sometimes you have to accept the side effects  If they are helping you and you can live with losing a few memories than keep on keeping on  Thank you  That makes sense  I'm a little sensitive so I guess I take things to heart more too  I try to live by the sayings treat people how you wish to be treated and if you don't have something nice to say don't say anything at all   No problem  You mentioned you don't have much of a support system   if you want to message me anytime  please do  I know I'm just an anonymous Internet person but I myself have received fantastic support from fellow sufferers all over the world      That's quite helpful thanks  It's take a lot of maturity to still be nice and kind to others who are nasty  I'm still learning but coming quite good at it now and it makes you feel good knowing that you don't have to be lowered to there ways because I have learnt you can't win with truly mean people they enjoy it   I laugh at dark depression or mental illness jokes particularly when they come from someone who also struggles with it  Maybe it's a coping mechanism  maybe it's just a way of hiding how real it is  I lost my dog recently and it hurts so bad but I do the exact same thing  It confuses my family  Yes  pretty normal  Most people don't exist at one emotional level constantly  Many of us go through periods of feeling better and hopeful and then coming back to the depression   Don't think that your mom showing concern means you need to cover this all up and pretend it's not happening  She'd probably feel better knowing the truth about how you feel and being able to help you  The fact that she right away asked if you needed to talk to somebody shows that she was willing to help  and you instead took that as a sign that you should lie and deny it  Nobody can start forcing pills down your throat or making you do anything you don't want to  all you have to do to start out is talk to somebody  If you want to make your mom feel better  you can still be honest about how you're feeling but just reassure her that it isn't that she did anything wrong and you aren't about to go jump off a building or anything  you just feel down sometimes   Anything that results in some sort of pain and is intended  not an accident  is self harm  so yes  that's self harm  thank you    My driving test was driving around a mall parking lot and just parking normally at the end  But others who went to a different place had to parallel park and crap  Some places are harder than others  If anyone asks just tell them you couldn't take it because  insert excuse here   Lots of people fail their driving test  And if you really can't drive practice some more you'll get it next time   Pretty much exactly what you did here  I would recommend trying to sit down and write out some of what you are feeling  because in the moment in person to person conversation it can be a bit tricky to remember everything you'd like to say  Prepare a description of what's been going on while you are in the comfort of your own home so you can just bring it with you and hand it to them  Their first question is going to be what brings you here and what are you hoping to get out of it  so you might as well have your answer ready    In terms of your concern that you'll just have medication thrown at you  it's possible  Especially if it's a psychiatrist and not just a therapist  The one time I saw a doctor of the type who can write a prescription  they barely listened to me and I walked out with a script for medication a few minutes later  Therapists are different  they are there to engage in talk therapy and behavioral counseling  All you can do is attend the appointment and see what type of person this doctor ends up being  If it's clear that they're just a pill pusher  you'll have to probably look elsewhere if you'd rather do talk therapy   That's what I felt at my friends new years party  Just alone  Most of my friends are in relationships and I just feel like nobody cares about me  Like something is wrong with me that I can't seem to get a serious girlfriend  Like I'm unlovable or something Thank you  That is very kind  Sometimes strangers understand better than anyone in real life  honestly this community is so supportive and understanding it's a great resource  Thanks again  I'd suggest a crisis hotline    in most countries  they're free  I wish there would be someone who legitimately cared and took time to listen to me  Like  i have "friends" but none of them really care  All of them have their own group and i'm always left out  I feel so drained  but i've done absolutely nothing in the past week besides work  Just living is exhausting enough for me Thank you   I am completely right there with you I actually like to walk around while I am reflecting and thinking about problems since it just feels natural for me  I haven't actually tried to walk around before playing games though  I might try that later   I think when you're posting for advice on what to do with it it's time to seek some professional help   Thanks  You could help us out by telling everyone you know  so we can break the social stigma Yeah  without real enforced consequences it can be hard to change  I too am someone who didn't benefit from parents who knew when to be strict  They helped me in all the wrong ways and refused to help in the ways I really needed    The irony though is that you seem to have the insight about why that alternative style of treatment would be better for you  and you seem keenly aware that you'll never get it from your parents  so you might some day have to just play pretend and decide to parent yourself  Even in his meek empty threat there is some truth to it  there will be consequences for your inaction some day  even if it's not until they are dead and gone and can no longer help take care of you  I know trying to imagine your own consequences isn't the same as actually having someone to play that role in your life  But so many of us will never have the parents that we wish we had  You'll either have to push yourself with your understanding that some discipline would be better for you  or whatever comes of your life you can fall back on blaming that your parents didn't use the right style of parenting  but at the end of the day it'll be your life in the future and nobody will excuse you for the failings of your parents    I'm sure it's hard to be a parent and to know when to implement tough love  You talk about wanting to mature but then even within this very argument it's a shuffling of blame onto how other people failed  You could get in the fast lane to maturing by accepting you're gonna have to enforce these rules on yourself and make the changes that you'd like to see    But yes  it is disabling to have parents who didn't know when to be firm   I wouldn't have any real idea what that would be like  title response   After getting to know me  people usually like me   But it's the fact that they don't bother to get far enough to "get to know me" before they're just gone   Can't very well go around tooting my own horn or you get accused of white knighting so       Damned if you do  damned if you don't  Be honest with your doctor even though I know it's scary to say some of these things out loud  Describe exactly what you said above  describe the physical effects you may be feeling  They may get you a referral and they may write you a prescription  There are a lot of different treatment paths and the one you take is ultimately your choice  I went for help finally at the beginning of October  I've been back every 4 weeks since to follow up with my treatment plan  Don't be discouraged if the first thing you try doesn't work the way you want it to  If you are prescribed something  you will likely be started on the smallest possible dosage and the work from there  If you are referred to someone for therapy there may be a bit of a wait  You may be prescribed some immediately helpful but short term drug like lorazapam or other fast acting drug to get you through the immediate time until you find a more permanent solution that works for you  If you feel you aren't being heard or understood  reiterate to them whatever you need  I don't know you but I'm proud of you for going to get help for this  It's hard  it's scary  Depression has the awful ability of making you feel like you don't deserve the help  You do  You deserve to feel like your best possible self  Good luck   I can relate  I have wondered the same thing  if there is something about me that is imperceptible to me but pushes other people away  Every friend I've ever had has bailed on me  and I struggle to ever make new ones  And I think compared to the average person I'm pretty insightful and do some pretty hefty self analysis  so if there was something obvious that I was doing wrong I think I would get it    Sorry you are hurting  I think real true friends are the rarest resource in the world these days  now that people are more interested in checking social media every 15 seconds and only investing time and energy into things that will immediately gratify them  There's an abundance of choice in everything these days  a million distractions available at your fingertips at any given moment  and people just don't care to take the time to get to know somebody   There are lots of online tests you can use to self assess to frame a conversation with your doctor  http   www netdoctor co uk quizzes goldbergdepression   http   psychologytoday tests psychtests com take test

it was hard making new friends because i felt the harsh judgements i was giving myself  would be the same in another persons view of me  learn to accept yourself  and others will follow  i know you're in a dark place  it gets dark as fuck  please do yourself a favor and go to a yoga class  preferably not a fitness focused one  but one more leaning towards the mental aspect of things  I promise you you will meet people who are comfortable with accepting themselves  their lives  and therefore other people  learn from them simply by being there  I wish you the best of luck and feel free to message me at any time  Who doesnt need more friends   one love man   Any update on how your doing   I my self suffer from childhood trauma   The way my childhood has now affected me  is in my attachment style  sounds a lot like you have the same one as I do  avoidant dismissive attachment  i e  Shuts down  self sabotages  As well as a host of other issues like boundaries issues    communication problems     It's easier said then done  As I have the same problem and am still trying to figure out how to not do this myself  but one way not to sabotage yourself relationship is to communicate to your partner how you're feeling  and let him know your feeling feeling  Feeling secure in the relationship will help you not be active in sabotaging it    Hope this helps  and good luck   Another great tool is therapy    Side effects are pretty individual though   OP might not have that at all  I just took my first AD today too  I wish you the best  I'm nervous as fuck and feel like someone unloaded a thousand electric butterflies into my body  They got me goin on Pristiq  I agree  please don't  Although things are hard  you are loved  Okay  And how are you feeling today  Here  this can help prove it       http   psychcentral com lib what are you so depressed about  I hope it works  They put me on 300 mg of wulbutrin and it didn't work out well  Not every pill works  I was awake for pretty much 4 days before I told my doc and switched to remron  At first I was alwlays drowsy but at least I can sleep   Depression is never 'okay'  its a mental illness and should be treated as such  The time to see a therapist is when you start to feel depressed for more than 2 weeks  Try different meal bars and high calorie snacks  Nuts and nut butters are high in calories  A big peanut butter sandwich might be good   There's no reason to feel ashamed of having bipolar  it's a illness and not your fault  Although feeling ashamed of the things you do because of bipolar is another beast     There is stigma and discrimination against people with bipolar disorder though  I'm not ashamed of my bipolar disorder persay  but I keep it secret except from those I trust because people can be really bad    Maybe you should talk with your dad and ask how he deals with it  I've managed to get a 3 92 this semester all the while being depressed  panicking  going through a break up from a long term relationship and constantly thinking I was losing my mind  Don't ask me how I did it because I honestly don't know  Last semester felt like a haze  I barely applied myself and didn't learn the way I wanted to  I just memorized for the sake of doing well on assignments exams  You have 2 days left  If you can live through depression  you'll find a way to power through these next couple of days  My final exams were about two weeks ago and Let me tell you  it was not easy studying for Thermodynamics   Stat  Mech  I realized what was at stake and fought off any distraction and tendency to self loathe and give in to that familiar feeling of being numb that depression manifests itself as  Study the material as if it was a cure to your depression  Don't worry about anything else for now  I'm rooting for you buddy  Easier said than done but boy was I relieved after giving it my all despite my afflictions  I've stopped trying to get better  I'm in maintenance mode  So basically just trying not to do suicide ideation too much    coping with the cycles  bipolar  which pretty much just consists of keeping my emotions as muted as possible so I don't hurt others or make any stupid decisions       It's less stressful this way   I'm comfortable knowing that I'm no longer setting myself up for disappointment  about 15 years of seeking treatment only to feel worse about myself each time  but I do realize that it's pretty fucked up that my baseline standards are "don't kill yourself" and "try not to ruin your life even more "  Well done on making the decision to take an antidepressant       How long were you in therapy and how many different therapist did you try  Just curious  What people do you have supporting you  I'm in a similar situation  Everyone seems to click with others easily  but I never can make friends that stick no matter how hard I try  I've given up now because trying seems pointless  "The deep void" is very fitting  If you need someone to talk to or message on here  I'll always answer  Having someone who gets it would be nice  You finally meet someone you really hit it off with and every day you look forward to sharing a new experience together  Then one day things slow down  The person is suddenly busier than normal  stops initiating communication  and all you're left with is a vast hole once occupied by hope and love  You feel intense loneliness which is only amplified by the happiness of those around you  You feel like that was your only chance at connecting with someone so deeply  and that if this didn't work out  there's no way you'll get so lucky again  I know exactly how it feels because I've gone through the exact same thing  More than once  And you probably will to   The disappointment and pain never gets better the second time around  It's crushing to feel so strongly toward someone and not have it reciprocated  in addition to losing them  it's also a hit to your confidence  But there is so much more out there than that one person  Hit the gym  keep up those grades  find a new hairstyle  join a club  take a trip outside the country  You will be surprised how much will change and how much  you  will change in the next few years  You will remember this as simply a blip in the past  Just keep at it   we're rooting for you  Insight means a lot  thanks You have a position of advantage in that you have the unique accolade of being there from the beginning  The management know you and the work you've put in over the years  And it seems you may have some friends in high places due to this  ones you may have forgotten about    Provided you haven't warped this account too much due to anger  I'm sorry to be blunt but I'm reasonably suspicious of some of the highly opinionated language you've used  you could raise the case you've mentioned here with them and  report your boss   I know that sounds a scary prospect but you seem to be putting a solid case together  You might want to line yourself up as a possible replacement discreetly also  I know it is more responsibility but really you could stump up where no one else will and do the job properly    If your current situation is a source of stress towards you the most constructive approach is to try and fix it rather than live with it gnawing away at you or running from it  This especially since you have a battle with depression on your hands  Sometimes you actively have to fight to push through life's challenges without being swept away       Any harmful thing that you intentionally inflict on yourself is self harm  Can you check out r selfharm  Depression can effect your memory so can SSRI  I took one for 13 years and I suffer from memory loss  My hippocampus is a bit messed up after I went to the neurologist for a scan   I don't think there's any amount of acceptable clinical depression  He should've been seeing someone for several years if he has felt like this    Medication and therapy compliment each other  Medication makes it easier to get out of bed but doesn't help to express yourself    Encourage him to seek further help  Plant the seed   To me it sounds clear that he should be seeing at the very least  seeing a therapist  In fact I'm surprised that he hasn't been if he's had a diagnosis for that long   Not sure if you've tried convincing him and failed or if you're too worried to bring it up at all  If you don't think you can bring it up without being too pushy  then we can try to give advice based on that  I don't think being angry or demanding that he seek therapy is going to be very helpful to him  but it may be that he just hasn't noticed how much he's been affected  I'd try to understand his experience of being unemployed  asking him questions and making it clear how you're willing to help   As always  make sure you're honest with yourself about what you can tolerate in the relationship  I use Fabulous    it's on the Google play store   Great for habit forming     I feel like this every time I step foot into school  too  People are actually jackasses   That sound's awfull  are you sure you communicated well about wanting to go to places  Perhaps they all think you would feel much cosier at home instead of visiting new unknown places   How do you feel like exploring just by yourself  That's how I feel  If I lived even 50 years ago I'd be dead by now  100  200   I'd be in an institution  300 400 I might be burned alive for being a witch  Why am I alive now  The technology keeps us alive  but not really living  I think about that all the time   some of us are just not built for life on earth as it is now  Why does everyone insist we can get better  Maybe in the future  but the technology to actually help us get better these days is so iffy   Sorry that was just reiterating what you've said  but you're not alone in thinking that  I am trying to come to terms with the fact that I'll probably decide to and carry through with killing myself within a couple years  It's like I'm mourning the life I could have had  but in the end who fucking cares  let's just make it all go away   Again sorry I'm so depressing  Just nice to encounter someone who looks at things the same way  Thanks  I'm just scared about facing my tutor tomorrow and telling him I haven't done the assignments I guess   3 It did help though   Same boat as you  Just told my first appointment would be around  200 even after insurance helps  Such bullshit   Definitely  We are creatures of habit and that goes for everything we do  Even having negative thoughts and shutting yourself away can become an addictive habit once you get stuck in that rut  Understand that it's not you as a person that is being like that  it's the routine you're stuck in of being cynical and automatically thinking negatively about things    I've been in the same situation for 10 years and am only just realising that and getting help to get out of it  You can do it  Good luck  friend Yep I totally get that  I feel like I'm getting progressively less well and it feels like I'm just getting sick  plus all the horrible cognitive stuff  It can even be hard to tell the difference sometimes   I didn't know I was depressed back when I was like 17  I went to the doctor with all my physical symptoms   GI problems  sleep problems  fatigue  difficulty concentrating  low motivation  etc   and she told me I was stressed and needed to meditate and reduce my schedule  oh and take an iron supplement  Wish it'd been identified then  would've prevented a fucking lot  It's ok  I have some really good friends   but I feel really bad bothering them with stuff  My family tries to be supportive  but in their minds I'm "cured" because I have the drugs and the counselling  They don't really get that it's an ongoing thing Catholic Charities has psychiatric appointments on a sliding scale of payment  The highest is like  60 I paid like  15  And no it was no pressure or religious in any way  They were just there to help I can agree with this 100   feel free to pm if need be    Jesus christ I can stop these damn tears  that last part really hit home  Thanks for the boost of confidence Internet stranger  12 more hours to go until help with 25 years of mental illness under my belt  I can handle these last few hours  I'm really glad that you're able to confide here and that you can also tell your friends  Can you tell any professionals about it  Even anonymously  like on a hotline   Do you have depression that prevents you from living your life to the fullest  I tried that  a "I'm going to live it up this weekend and then kill myself" sort of thing  but turns out I couldn't live it up when I felt that bad  Or are you suicidal even though you feel otherwise okay  Sounds amazing   Yeah  but I had some more today   Not quite as cheery as before  but I'm also missing some sleep today   Haven't taken anything prescription in over a year  though   I did want to convey that I was in a better mood   but I'm not sure that I meant to use quite so many exclamation marks   lol  You're welcome  Reflecting back  I've done plenty of less than healthy escapism and avoidance  But some of the best restarts I've done was thanks to staying with friends or family for a bit  I'm grateful that they gave me that opportunity   Good luck  I'd welcome short PMs on your status if you find that helpful  from the bottom of my heart  i feel for you  i really do  stay strong OP  seek therapy during this time  at least you know that you're not the only one feeling this way  your family will all be there for each other during this time   Okay  How do you feel about explaining to your family how you're currently feeling  Congrats   I hope that it works for you and you have mild no side effects   It took me a couple tries to find one that worked for me  but the meds I'm on now  Effexor  work great and I'm doing much better   It's a night and day difference  Okay  Are you still feeling suicidal  I'd like to avoid that  my mother will just worry  and I think Dad would just get pissed off  I don't see them as my main support system anymore  and I'll be moving back to school in a few days  so I don't feel I have much of a connection here anymore   and im not aware that it's outdated  then you gotta read more     And I'm also aware that humans can never attain the ultimate truth give that we are so limited with our ability to observe   This is very true and you are close  you just got to keep going  You got seriously a lot to learn  there is so many topics  beyond astronomy  that are hugely importnat to the universe  the more you read and educate the more you realize the system behind it all  all the magik that exists in this universe  all of things happening right in front of you that you cannot see  Perception is just as it is  nothing is real    We all learn one day  Thank you for answering  I guess the stigma and discrimination has a lot to do with it   Same boat mate  Following for answers  Okay  Have you ever talked to adults at your school about how you're feeling  He has seen a therapist off and on  just when the depression gets really bad  He just doesn't see therapy as a regular need  But it could be just a lack of funds growing up   He's somewhat open to the idea  and I definitely want to go to therapy with him  I think he might be concerned with the money  and finding a therapist that's a good fit  Try different therapists until you find one that "fits"  You're not going to mesh with just anyone so take your time and find one that you do   I hope this helps some   if you need to talk  feel free to message   Kinda both  I'm essentially always suicidal but some days I can't get out of bed and other days I'm fine disagree with the other posters  i tried the medication route  with 2 different medications  and the side effects were scary  it was genuinely a better option to just deal with my normal depression   i have a friend who is a biomedical engineering PHD student at Cornell  and he told me to avoid these medications as it's not fully understood just how they affect the brain  i ignored him  but i realized later that he has a great point   I know i'll get a lot of flack for my viewpoint here  but please understand that i'm speaking from personal experience as well as educated consultations   if this is your first time seeking therapy  sounds like it is based on your post   and you like her  then give her a chance before you start down the road of the for profit pharmaceutical industry  i'd say give it a few months and see if you notice any improvements  if you really are still struggling then  then medication may be worth the try  Go back and get some counselling dude  maybe see someone different  At the end of the day  they're not there to give a fck about you  and they're not pretending to either  Their job is to analyse your issues from the outside and advise you how to fix them  because your head is not clear enough to do it yourself   Speak to some friends as well and just be completely honest with them  Trust me  I've been hiding my feelings for the last 10 years and putting on this mask of the funny nice guy  I'm only just starting to talk to friends about it now and I'm so surprised with how understanding they are being  You'll be surprised too  Speaking to people is a massive help  And if you go to a doctor they may prescribe you something to help you temporarily lift yourself up  and once you've done that it will be easier to fix your problems   Godspeed I've been to the counselling services at school and was basically told to fuck off after a few sessions   I know I definitely want to see a therapist  I feel like talking about some things might help tremendously  I like the idea of writing everything down  I am about to start my list  Thank you so much  Check my post I'm making a depression support group for my girlfriend so anyone who wants other support from people over the world that could become friends let me know    I know any amount of depression isn't ok  but when someone has depression for this long and after many changes of medication  it's hard to assume that it will ever be gone  Ah  that must be tough  I have bipolar so I get that off and on thing even if the pattern is a bit different  Seriously  sometimes all that helps is medications  which sucks  And sometimes those don't help  Therapy can make you feel like you're not alone though  even if it can't convince you you don't want to die  Just in my experience  I'm in about the same boat  It's hard man  It's fucking hard  I had to bug the receptionist of this therapist whose willing to work pricing and make it affordable 3 times before she finally decided ok she can "squeeze me in " like it's a dentist appointment  This is life or death for me  and working this hard to get the help to simply be content is treated as nothing  and why work so hard when the exit is right there    I'm sending my best   How come  At the time I was going with help for my panic attacks  and they said that I was fine and there was nothing more they could do for me  They did this right before exams started  so I'm a little apprehensive about going back Me too  I wish more people knew how accessible and cheap used instruments can be  They  rightly  think 'oh god  I can't afford an instrument' because they think you have to buy one new or something  If they're not afraid of a few scratches or dents  and you're not looking for a professional level instrument that would be at home on stage with the Vienna Philharmonic  they could find a very affordable used instrument online or in thrift stores and get started learning  Hey mate  I hear you  I did seven days a week  eight to twelve hours on weekdays and six on weekend for three years  It really fucked me up in more ways than one    Here's the thing  We live in a time where a steady job is a luxury  That  however  does not mean that you have to abuse yourself to do it  Trust me  no stakeholder benefits from a workaholic    My advice to you is to set limits  Work diligently for six hours every day  Set daily tasks that you need to accomplish  Screw around the rest of the time if you feel like it  but just clock in the six hours  Daily    The thing is that humans are only productive in six hour increments  That is why slave labor ranging back to Ancient Egypt relied on the number of bodies to do the job rather than on the skill of individual workers    And lastly  for the love of god  get a a hobby that you enjoy and devote time to it  I made a huge mistake when I gradually quit everything I  used to  enjoy for the sake of "recovering" from the day's labor    Good luck   Edit  Also  I would like to point out that you admit that you're not doing work tasks  but rather screwing around on the Internet  Don't worry  I've done that too  but realize this  If you start doing your  job  for six hours every day  it will make your life much  much more enjoyable  You will  I assure you on this  feel better about yourself and the job at the end of the day if you do the six hours in   Okay  Do you have any type of mental health diagnosis  You can make it  I know you can  It's hard to see it  but you can  Just avoid what's bothering you  If your brain is bothering you  avoid it  If other people  or the Internet  or whatever else might be affecting you  avoid it  I know you can get to that appointment  Hey bud  thanks for opening up and sharing  It was very brave of you  I know how depression can make you feel like wanting to kill yourself every moment  I know life is miserable and fucked up and you feel like no one cares  It's okay to feel this way  But the world would be a much more sadder place without you  Think of your mentally ill mother and your baby sister  How would they feel if you killed yourself  Heck  I am a random stranger on the internet and I would feel fucking devastated if you killed yourself  The world is a wonderful place  Believe me  Most of the time it feels like shit but there are corners of the globe you havent seen yet and its gorgeous  There could be a chance you might travel some day and get to see the rest of the world dont die before then  There is a chance you will fall in love and get married and have kids  There is a chance you will meet your soulmate one day  There is a chance life will get bettter  Dont die before then  As long as you are alive you have chances  As long as you are alive you have options and you have the possibility of change  You have the chance to change your life around and make yourself happy  As soon as you die all of that is gone  Death is lonelier than life  You will rot in your grave with worms eating you  While you are still alive there is still time to reach out and communicate with others who feel the same way you do  Look at this sub  You are not alone  You know the main benefit of staying alive  You can stay and help other people who suffer the same way you did and help them save themselves    You are indeed severely depressed from the sounds of it  There is treatment there is therapy you are not gonna feel this way forever  This too shall pass my friend  Everything passes  The main mistake that we make is thinking our sadness will last forever  But it doesn't  The sun still rises every day  So will your sadness pass away and a new day shall begin  Hold tight friend you can do it  Please try to see a doctor and get help for your depression if you can   Hey  you and I are basically on the same boat  There's this girl i met on the internet different countries  and we have known each other for one year already  Recently  i've been initiating conversations more often and tonight i sent her a good night text and she replied "Thank  you    Good  night"  Those three dots really bothered me  Just two months ago she'd say "Good night sweetheart  sleep well and have wonderful dreams"  Am i upset  Of course i am  But i can't expect her to love me  I have to deal with that  And i always hope for the best  I hope that sharing my story helps you in some way  All the best to you    I literally just made my first post in this subreddit about my first appointment with a doctor to hopefully help me tomorrow  My turning point has been the last 2 days  it's been a really  really dark time  However  I saw a post on this sub today about someone who took their first anti depressant today with a string of comments on it  One of the commenters said that they had been on their meds for a few weeks before waking up and feeling alive  feeling like the person they were 2 years ago  I completely lost it  I do not feel alive  I barely feel like I am existing  The person I am now is a total stranger  a scary stranger  I can't live like this anymore  Half the world is on anti depressants it seems  so what's another person if it means I get to feel ANYTHING besides sadness and darkness  I hope you find the help you deserve  we all deserve a chance to live   Yup  have plenty of vivid dreams  It's a thing with depressed people where they only go into REM stage  That's the stage where 'normal' people go into a couple times a night  other than the whole night  I had a dream last night where I was laughing with my old friends and was having a blast  The other dream I had was someone strangling me  My dreams also have all the cuts on my arms and legs from self harm  It's oddly vivid  Anxiety disorder is my primary issue  But I have struggled with depression in the past   I am very interested in hearing about anyone's non pill methods for disorder control  I am currently experimenting with diet with varying degrees of success  Part of the issue is I'm veg  so cutting out meat in addition is really tough  I do agree that cutting or quitting gluten seems to help with clarity and overall well being  Thank you for posting  please share what you are comfortable sharing  Okay  Does the school know what you're struggling with  Good for you  I still can't get help  not strong enough  Someday maybe I'll be like you   Can we be friends  Seriously  I have the same exact feelings  PM me   Thank you for sharing that viewpoint  I am open to the therapy process and gaining new skills there  but I didn't like how she shut down the possibility of meds after knowing me for less than an hour  I just want someone who willl support me in whatever treatments we both think are best and I was turned off my her refusal to really help with the process of getting a psychiatric evaluation  What were some of the side effects you experienced   I'm literally shaking  my head hurts  my body is really cold  I'm crying  I'm going insane  I've literally lost all sanity  I want friends  I want new people in my life  However I'm so psychologically damaged from being lonely and being treated like fucking shit  I always wear a fake smile  underneath is sheer hatred towards people of my own age  I have been nothing but nice  nothing but supportive  and people have to stomp all over me  I don't want to live  I don't want to live when I've lost all my sanity  I don't want to live where no matter how much effort I put in  I'm always thrown aside  It must be the fact I hate partying  drugs  and smoking  Can't think if any other reason  I can't fucking take it anymore  I'm tired of having episodes of hysterically crying every single night  My life has become too painful  I also got temporarily laid off from work because I've been working too much  Everything that could possibly go wrong is going wrong and I literally just want out  Based on my experience as well as my studies in psychology I firmly believe that therapy is really the only thing that helps  The trick is finding the  right  therapist  because like there at unhelpful  bad match doctors there are also  unhelpful  bad therapists  Your husband really has to find one thats best for him  I suggest using psychology today's find a therapist option  You can read profiles to help find a good match   I do this all the time  even though I don't like smiling  It doesn't make sense  Maybe it's some kind of inner coping mechanism I'm not aware of  Best thing to do then is to just stop them before they brush it off  just drop the "i need help because i am depressed and contemplating suicide"  Don't give them an out   But how'd you go today anyway  Same thing happening to me right now  Not so long ago I had tons of friends I talked to everyday  Now I have like one friend i talk to maybe two times a month  But hang in there  the odds of you being lonely forever are probably pretty small  since internet is a thing  hang in there  I have experience going cold turkey with paroxetine  which is another SSRI    I felt the same pulses in my head  I heard strange zapping sounds in my head and felt them too  'Zap    'Zip '  it was like hearing my neurons communicating with each other  really uncomfortable experience     The best thing you can do is to sleep it off  I slept maybe 15 hours a day for the first few days going cold turkey  Eating sweets and drinking a lot of water also helps    Most of the withdrawal symptoms went away within 1 week for me  but it took 1 month to get rid of the head pulses  No problem  how are you going  It's true that professional help is expensive  I wont argue with that  But things like stretching  hot showers  hot chocolate and other little things that might bring an ounce of joy are free   I dont know  I tried  Currently feeling very depressed and lonely myself so feel free to respond  Maybe we can keep each other company  Well done   I'm on Prozac  Started the past summer  I hope it helps you with minimal side effects   What is the max dosage  same  i feel like i have periods when life is lit and then even longer periods when life is just full of depression and anxiety  you can always hmu if you need anyone to talk to  Check my post I'm making a support chat for my girlfriend with depression  it's lots of girls with depression all supporting each other if you'd like to be a part of it    yeah  I think I get that zapping  too  I've definitely been having trouble sleeping  Mom gave my room to my cousin and his wife and kid  but then had trouble sleeping  still been have trouble since I've gotten back to my own place  thanks for the help  same here  just started celexa like a week ago   dont even feel anything haha It's obviously easier said than done   When you're really tired and drained  it's a challenge   But in my experience every little bit helps   Psychologically I'll feel better the rest of the day  and usually have more energy  easier time sleeping  etc   That said  I hike 1 2 hours a day because of my high energy dog   And when I'm drained  that can be an hour of slow moseying   I try to workout in the morning  but I sometimes manage a mere 5 minutes of exercise   Squats  weights  circuit stuff   Or maybe 10 minute of lazy yoga   It's always better than nothing   Are there any symptoms in particular you are wanting to address  I feel like I know what you're talking about  The utter hopelessness of  "well  this is me for the rest of my life"  can be soul crushing  even in the good times when you think  "ahh  I feel good today but tomorrow I will be back to my normal  sad  self"   The feeling that the good times are too fleeting and forever waiting for the inevitable downturn  Personally I feel that these thoughts will never ever truly go away  life is just too turbulent to be happy all of the time  In my experience the thought of "That's it I've won  no more depression for me" is a dangerous one as it only works to make the next downturn worse  Therefore it is important to learn as much as you can in the bad times   and   the good  making the conscious effort to gain new insights into yourself   to disgustingly over simplify  recognising what makes you sad  what makes you happy  what kind of thoughts start to enter your mind when you feel yourself on the precipice of no return  what changed in  your life  that brought you out of your episode this time  what changed in  yourself   what happened today that you feel good  how can that be repeated  The list goes on  In short  I don't believe that anyone 'just gets better'  their ability to deal with it does when they are open to adapting their way of thinking      When you say 'stuff' what do you mean  Psuedo normal 'life' stuff  paying bills finding a job building or maintaining relationships  or are their particular extenuating circumstances in your life that would be hard for anyone to deal with  In either case it is not a weakness to feel weak  True strength is found in ones ability to  endure   a trait that I personally hold in a higher regard than many others as it transcends the circumstances of the individual and provides a window into the integrity of their character   Now you talk of not being being able to cope on an evolutionary level  Where I understand your statement and have thought similar things myself  I would argue that the successful evolution is built on two defining traits    1  The ability to adapt   2  The ability to endure  The very fact that you undergo this battle every day  despite the fact  you do not always feel like you're winning shows that on an evolutionary level  you are doing exactly what you need to do    As a sidenote I would say that comparing yourself to others is inherently unhelpful  I e  " x  isn't bothered by  y   so why does  y  bother me so much  I must be a pussy"  and just leads down a road of self perpetuating internal resentment  We are all on this arduous march my friend and we all have our strengths  even if we ourselves cannot see them    I hope I've managed to address some of your issues  I've drawn quite a bit from personal experience and hope I haven't missed the point   All the best   "so many people help each other stay afloat when we feel like we are drowning"  if we all hold onto each others limbs we can form a human raft and float to a nearby tropical island   It can take a long time to find a drug  or more often a cocktail  that works for you   Talk to your doctor  express when you think a medication isn't working  be open to trying different things   Sorry  it's super fucking frustrating   Probably most of us have been there  I feel ya there   100    It's 2AM right now  I'm missing school tomorrow again  I'm only going back to it this thursday   I feel like if I say that to my parents they will just tell me the same thing over and over again  Just get to Friday  Tell your therapist  I think moving could be really good for you  get you in a new place where you get freedom  your brain energy can be used for setting up your place  finding your tribes and not thinking about all the awful shit you've been through   Do you have a therapist or anything   Have you ever tried writing all this stuff down  Doctor Who fan with lady bits and an interest in women's health   Just about to get my RN and will go on from there  Works either way   is prozac any good  im thinking about starting to take it  Barf  Is it bad that I just did it and it felt nice  Awesome  I'm a student physical therapist with an interest in pelvic floor therapy   that's fair  but understand that maybe she isn't "restricting you in what you want" but rather  she's using her education   knowledge of her field in determining that medication isn't the best option   i took effexor  and then wellbutrin  effexor completely took away all feeling  and gave me erectile dysfunction  which was awful as I had a gf at the time  wellbutrin was much better  at least at first   but then after about 2 months i started getting even worse anxiety than before  got so bad i had to leave work early some days  and curl up in my bed  couldn't even leave to eat dinner  it also gave me really bad rage  as i threw my phone against the wall and shattered it after some friends made fun of me  was a huge overreaction  and this is what ultimately led me to realize that the medicine isn't for me  can't say that i'm doing great today  but i don't have the crippling anxiety since i stopped the medicine   also understand that  at least for wellbutrin   the generic version does nothing  i was told  through forums  and my psychiatrist  that the brand medicine was the way to go  which runs  1500 per bottle    luckily i had good insurance  but still cost  50 per bottle for me   anyway  keep an open mind and get the facts  don't discount your therapist  like i said  after a few months  if you think therapy alone isn't helping  then just get referred to a psychiatrist through your general physician and he'll help you  I know what you mean by facing it on your own  but that isn't entirely correct  Others are there for you and so are doctors if it is that bad   I used to work at a servo  aussie slang for gas station service station   I was and still am and fighting depression and anxiety  The boss I worked for was pure poison   There was an aged care facility right next door and every morning Henry would come in to get a 500ml bottle of milk  some bread and a newspaper  He would always be there every morning at 7 30am   Seeing Henry was the highlight of my day  He was such a nice man and easy to talk to  I'd talk to him about his day  his plans for the rest of tbe day  anything  He'd ask how I was and sometimes drop a "pearl of wisdom" or just hear me out with a smile  They guy was well over 90   It took him about two minutes to walk from the back of the shop to the front  so I used to walk with him and carry his things for him   That's what I mean  you could be somebody's Henry  the person that they look forward to and you wouldn't know  At 8am if he hadn't been in I'd actually get a little upset and worried   But no  you aren't alone in this  You don't have to carry it yourself  i'm lucky enough to have found a woman who loves me  understands me and is there for me   Yeah it may feel like a joke and the joke is on you  but you do have someone  If need be  i'd be happy to be that someone  no judgment here   Are you seeing a psych at all  They may be able to help you lighten the load  I have to see mine at 3pm today AEST  It helps you should talk to one if you feel alone in this  I went to about 8 different psychs before I found one I liked  I see both a psychologist and psychiatrist seperately though  What works for me may not work for you   But if you are alone and down in the dumps why not give it a try  What have you got to lose   Edit  I'm going to add you to my friends list thing on reddit if that's cool  You can talk to me even if I am some random ocer the other side of the world  I don't know you or your problems  but i'm here if you want to talk to me about it  That's the thing mate  You aren't alone  i'm trying to get you to see that and I'm extending my hand to you  If you don't want to take the offer then that is completely up to you  But you aren't alone  I guess this is a better way  opposed to cutting myself  Thank you  I'd say better to make an appointment and see a doctor sooner rather than later   You seem to be pretty self aware and get that something is off   A lot of your life can pass by while dealing with depression   When are you going back to school   I've been on antidepressants and the like for about four years now  I've gone through lots of medications but nothing seems to really help me personally  When starting something new there's usually a brief period of improvement but then I slip down into new lows  I've just been getting worse and worse  I want to try treatments like TMS and electro shock  and worst case a cingulotomy  but that's not really something I can bring up easily when I'm still fully dependent on a family  As things are right now I just have to keep hoping that the next medications do something for me  Yeah  anything new to break that funk is worth trying     wonder if CBD oil has   the same   AchEI action   I don't think THC has AchEI activity  due to the surplus of data showing that it causes memory deficits through AchE or a process that is interrupted by AchEI   However  I  think  you're getting at the fact that CBD might be an AchEI  and that might be true  I really don't know   If so  it would be a neat interaction between THC and CBD  like a balancing act of sort  I think it's possible that your therapist may have a more complex view on drugs than she stated in the first hour  so it may be worth revisiting the topic before jumping ship  Maybe even tell her that you like her but don't think you can stick with someone who doesn't support your decision to try medication    I really struggle to find a worthwhile therapist so I personally would hesitate to throw away that relationship without talking    Also  at least where I live  my general practitioner can recommend a psychiatrist  I wouldn't lie to her but you could work around her to assert how important this is  Or you know  find a new therapist  It's really up to your feelings on the matter  Oh that's a good one  Good luck in your field    Your not alone OP  I realized recently that most if all of my friends that I had back in high school doesn't even care about me  After high school is like I don't even exist to them anymore  Currently in college and haven't made much friends yet either  I figured that I might as well use this time that I have right now to improve myself  work out  study  find a new interest etc  I advise you should do the same too instead of being so bored  It doesnt matter because the feeling Will always b with me  Loneliness is normal    Everyone gets lonely when they spend too much time with themselves  introverts do this a lot more often  I'm 24 and I've felt very lonely at 17  All I wanted was this girl that I was in love with but she didn't want to be with me    I started drinking a lot with my couple friends and going to parties just getting drunk off our asses and not caring about anything other than having fun  It helped with anxiety and it relieved some of my social awkwardness but it was a double edged sword like most things are  I've done things I'm not proud of while inebriated and it has shaped a skewed view of things in my head that I'm still trying to chisel out and remedy   Instead of drinking  taking drugs and just in general participating in risky behaviour I would advise you to start a hobby or begin learning an instrument or taking up a sport and being persistent in one or more of these endeavours  The benefits you get from meeting new people and engaging in new social circles are tremendously important in shaping you as an independent and stable human being  You also get a lot of satisfaction from the process of improving at what you're doing no matter how slow it  is   You WILL meet new and interesting people who WILL get you and WILL want to hang out with you by just going out and participating in things you truly like or are passionate about  Don't look for friends by how they look or if they're popular or whatever  go do something that interests you and talk with people who are interested in the same things as you  it's how you will find people that have similar thought processes and appeals as you do  Be brave  Take up a pottery class  Anything really  No problem  I love it  and I actually like hearing the little shaking bottle sound it makes to remind me    I have this exact same problem and it's 1000x worse during the holidays with all the sales  so now i'm  3000 in debt all because all the spending was so fun and seemed like such a good deal at the time   Lately I've been sleeping up to 20 hours a day  day after day  I haven't been able to go to school  shower  eat  or even get out of bed  It's a typical occurrence in depressives  and it's horrible to be in  One thing I'd suggest though is taking something to help you sleep around ten or eleven and getting a full night's rest  keeping to a proper sleep schedule can often make it easier to get up and out the door  Antidepressants only have an effect on 30  of people who try them  If it's been three months  I suggest talking to your doctor about trying another medication  It can be daunting to think about having to taper off one medication and start another  not knowing how it will effect you  but it's worth it when you come across the perfect drug or combination  It took me around 6 years to find the perfect combination  with several suicide attempts and hospitalizations in between  Looking back  I'm thankful I stuck it out because the medications I'm on now are life changing   Man   reading this was hard  I lost a lot of people throughout my battle with depression and each lost still feels like the first one  Even when i learned how to put people at a distance  close off myself  i still end up losing those dear to me  In fact  recently i lost a very special someone who i thought i could trust my life with    You can blame them for hurting leaving you  or you could blame yourself for getting too close  I've had depression for almost 4 years now  and i still both  Remember that pain is relative  if your problems aren't strong enough to kill you  they may be strong enough to kill someone else  some people just can't handle others' problems regardless on how much that person means to someone  especially if that person's problems is greater than their own  Same  I can't even remember the last time I genuinely laughed     Prozac is a pretty good first antidepressant  Like all antidepressants it will take a few weeks to kick in  but it has milder side effects than some others and if you need to get off it  you can taper it off pretty easily  Far less horror stories coming off it as you can cut down and be done with it  saw this today  pretty interesting  https   www sciencedaily com releases 2016 12 161228171130 htm I failed twice   In MASS state troopers sit on the test with you  And my anxiety was spiked so high I could barely function   If only I had popped an atavan or Xanax beforehand   On the third try I got a nice old statee that was chill and nothing like the meanest man I had twice before  Finally passed  I dont even know where to start with my therapist    She won't say a thing and I will lhave to talk and talk and talk  Its always me talking  I am just waiting for her to butt in and tell me something  I just blabber on about nothing and she ends our meeting at what i feel like is abrupt   I'm in rural NE TN  3 months out for psych appt is standard  Only way to get quick help is via suicidal threat   Then the help you get is mass quantities of psych drugs that make you feel dead or no better  This is the first time a new pill hasn't fixed my depression  It really sucks  CBT every week not too helpful  The things that help the most are THC and activity  Crazy but the THC gives me the motivation to get out of bed and go on with life  I'm not a kid either  57yo F  So yes depression sucks and most people don't understand  I know I didn't  Until now  Sending happy vibes  You know there are like    athletes who get depression right  Have you told them where you are mentally  Where you   actually   are and where your mindset is  including the thoughts of a "permanent solution"    fyi it isn't a solution    The only thing I could really do is ask you to ask them again  but be 100  honest about it  Don't dance around your issues  As I said  don't give them an out  if it is easier for you to talk to one  then divide and conquer  so to speak   I'm sorry I can't get you the help you need but hey  i spend way too much time on reddit so you can talk to me at any time   I would also advise going for a walk in the sun  jog if you can  but physical activity will ease the load  You say you are overweight   kill two birds with one stone  Ease the depression while burning excess weight  You may find as one goes so does the other  Walk it off  metaphorically and physically   You're still in school  I hated it there and was in the same position you are now  I have been there and I know where you are coming from  You said it is 2am  that puts you around the great brittain area if I'm not mistaken   Are you able to book a psych yourself  Do they have a public health system where you are  If they do  ask them about it  You may be able to book yourself in   But try bringing it up with one parent on their own if they shoot you down when they are together   It is hard and it hurts but you won't get through this without some help   Only reason I did was because i was able to sneak in and buy alcohol without ID because i could grow a beard  I would not recommend this as I now have liver problems due to my drinking history  Just hang in there and hit me up for a chat when you're down in the dumps  k  oh okay  ill guess i will try it then  thanks  You could ask your psychologist about psychotherapy  I had to fire that doctor because she shamed me badly when i was asking for help with the fatigue   I also had a pinched nerve that was causing a ton of pain and preventing me from working out  which on top of the fatigue was really making me unhappy with life   She mocked me  told me my only hope was a 900 calorie a day diet and or bariatric surgery  called me a liar  and wouldn't tell me what infection i had that she was prescribing antibiotics for   I just wanted help finding the energy to work out more  dude    Thanks so much Then I'd make it clear to him that you think it's worth the money  Especially to get through a period of unemployment or lower than normal social contact  As someone who has actually done this     DO NOT TELL YOUR FRIENDS   because 1  if they're truly good friends of yours  they'll do everything they can to stop you so if you're really serious about which i hope you're not  then that may interfere with your plans  and 2  you might end up losing them  It's hard to show people your other "you"  so it might be easy just reaching to a stranger and being yourself  I don't know you still there mike  I want to kill myself I think it's cause there's no consequence  Nobody cares if a stranger judges them if it's someone they've never seen and never will see  But if your friends and family knew everything then they might judge you  and people can't deal with those they love rejecting them  My first driving test I thought I had done great  I parked the car and the instructor asked me how I thought I did  I said "great"  He then frown and asked if I noticed that I had only  come to a complete stop  at 1 stop sign out of 10  I few weeks after I took it again and passed  A lot people fail it a few times before they pass  Don't let it get you down    Not that great  You  Idk if I'd say I got a 'bad' person  I'd say she was just really careful  She said I didn't necessarily do anything wrong  From what she said I'm surprised it was enough to fail Are you angry  So annoying when people ask stuff like that when they already know the answer  just seems like they want to make you look dumb I've got that unmotivation  Actually  I'm avoiding my homework right now  and its only seven fucking sentences  O wel  You keep saying that she still likes you but at the same time your saying your not good enough  Considering the fact that staying away from her isn't doing any good  you should at least try to get something going again   I've been on 18 different meds over the past 25 years  I currently have a psychiatrist who says oh well if you can't afford one of the new drugs      The only thing left to try is lithium and ECT  No  Not good options  Good luck  Just know everyone reacts differently to different meds  So keep trying  At least I got relief for years at a time on SSRIs but sertraline made me suicidal   Thanks  Hope all goes according to plan this year I sincerely hope things get better for you  Good luck  I hate going to the library    I'll see if I can find them on YouTube though   I've been thinking of writing a story since I was 15  I'm 24 now  I was inspired by comics and games  both Japanese and Western  Mind if I add you  Do you have a therapist  Actual prescription drugs   Does it matter  Why   If a therapist said that then they are a shit therapist to put it bluntly  I saw about 8 different psychs before finding one that I liked and felt comfortable being open with  I agree with your idea of silence being beautiful  talking just to talk is annoying  And it's fine if you're not amazing at science or math  because people who are really good at those things are bad in other subjects  And there's a lot of people on this planet  so you're probably not the stupidest one    If you're always thinking of things you're not good at  you'll never achieve anything or improve in other things that you might excel in    I think it has some importance  yes  Also  who  you are angry with  I'm truly sorry for what has happened  i've lost people because of my depression as well and each lost still hurts like the first one    Maybe a distraction could do you wonders  it has helped me when times get really rough  something or anything really to get your mind off of the people you lost  Making new friends or meeting new people might ease your mind of things  not a permanent fix but at least you won't feel too lonely    Again really sorry for what happened  i know too well what happens when people can't handle your depression and i hope this comment helped  Wish you best of luck That's a tough spot  I'd say the drugs and alcohol definitely don't help  but idk if they directly make it worse  Brick walls are okay we all need to vent sometimes  I hope things get better for you    Ok  thanks  Addressing your point of being honest with myself  I think that's part of why I'm reaching out to outside sources on this  I'm being patient and compassionate now but I fear that one day I'll snap and not be able to tolerate his current behavior anymore  I probably shouldve mention i dont but probably need meds and no therapist  It'll get better on the child  You're doing the right thing   I'm on the end part of my fight to get simple visitation with my child  It does take a long time  but it'll be worth it in the end   Good old me  Could you please answer my question now  Relating so hard to this  Met someone online  ending up driving 5 5 hours to meet in real life  Wasn't really romantic at all irl  which was totally cool with me  I knew that was a possibility and was totally happy to just be good friends  But our conversations have changed and become less frequent and it made me realize how much I enjoyed his presence in my life  even though it was just a lot of texting  We still talk  but it's not the same  I miss the way it was before    You should totally try to get meds and a therapist  probably way better than drugs and just suffering like this   Noo i'm not avoiding her we talk pretty regularly sorry that wasn't clear  I wish I could  get something going  but the problems that broke us up are still there  Thanks though man means a lot that you read it and took the time to respond    I've started experiencing this  I have some extra money and all i want to do is buy clothing and random things for hobbies  I'm afraid of spending all my money   I think you could channel your anger into something beautiful like a drawing or a sculpture or you could write poetry  It's better than cutting yourself   I get my information off YouTube  science updates and all that   Magik  There's a possibility but I find it hard to believe  And yes  reality is illusion  Okay  Same reason as before  And I'm okay  thank you  Strangers on internet are people you don't see in person  U can't see or hear their reactions and u know they won't be able to confront you considering they're strangers  I gave up trying to find psychiatric help  The wait time was two or three months  or they didn't accept my insurance  or they weren't taking new patients or  the best ones were "we don't treat patients who have taken benzos" or "you're not that bad  so we can't take you"  I'm  not  that depressed or anxious  Thanks  I didn't know that    I feel terrible to group everyone into one gray colored bucket  but you're just a paycheck to them   You're    Confusing me with that cryptic quote   hugs u tightly  Interesting  I'm at the other end of the spectrum  I'm 57 depression all my life self medicated age 13 33  Prozac worked great for 10 years  Then got another 10 out of lexapro  Then 4 years from venlafaxine   Now big pharmaceutical is not working so I've gone back to THC  Not ideal but at least I'm getting out of bed  So I now feel like a kid again sneaking around "being bad" I genuinely think people are fucking with me when they have any interest in me  Like it's some sick joke or a dare  I know exactly that feeling  I know how it feels to lose that one girl and I know you're happy for her  but it's also important to be happy for YOU  I don't know how to do that  but I hope you figure it out man  Some people find the strain of weight training or martial arts to be helpful   When I was younger  I know martial arts helped   Not even the physicality but the loss of self in pain    I guess    Listen  I failed my test five times  Got it on the sixth try  The whole experience was a pain in the ass because I got so anxious I couldn't handle it and I had to start logging my hours to show them I was practicing  but you know what  I got it  So it took me a while  big whoop  You'll get it too and it'll feel way better when ya do  I promise    U can do it    Wellbutrin was really scary for me   I was suicidal and had horrible panic attacks   Congratulations  I take Sertraline and it's been helpful for me  I had to increase from 50mg to 100mg but sometimes that happens  It also takes a while to "work"  so just be patient   Agreed  It's very hard admitting that you need help  I don't think its unreasonable to be so concerned about a friend  but I'd also note  I've camped and backpacked many times in storm conditions    It seems worse than it is     Though  I'm sure the psychotic part won't help safety  it could be just as unsafe in town  no   I do hope your friend is ok and contacts you soon  that has to be really stressful  No I said be thankful you can feel both good and bad emotions and feelings  once you lose these things then you are in a world of hurt  so yes be very thankful you still have that emotional capacity  I'd give anything to have that             all very good advice that I agree with  especially not doing her work anymore   Rules  2  Do not post or respond with  Claims about the efficacy of any treatment or self help strategy including religion  3  Please don't diagnose others or advocate for or against specific treatments or self help strategies    I don't think I am that good of a person  I have a strange desire ti physically and or mentally hurt others  I try to put this at bay with things like video games and drawing  I draw alot of violence  but I still don't know why its there and it won't go away     I gett very lonely but never want to interact with others  I'm very asocial a bit more than just being introverted     I don't like telling people about my feelings because I don't like being vunlerable  I get anxiety at random times and sometimes fear for my life when I am alone for no reason     I don't feel happy nor sad but I don't know if I want to change this  I lack motivation even to do things I like I get frustrated and angry when I make mistakes and often give up easily    I'm messing up in school  I am too lazy to do things and my mom isn't very helpful about it   These points are literally me  I'm that lonely rude asshole from class who stays away from everybody to avoid a fuck up  the kid who does nothing because he is just not enough to make to the end   Oh well   does it matter anyway  Life just fucking sucks  Also congrats on sharing thoughts here on reddit  A small step i guess  but an important one  Seroquel is the only thing that knocked me out so maybe ask your doctor about it    Some things that I do to help me fall asleep other than medication is  No caffeine past noon  Strict sleeping schedule and getting out of bed in the morning  Doing breathing exercises while trying to go to sleep  Great post  Agree with everything in it    Often times  I hear read depressed people lamenting how they cannot "change"  like flipping a light switch from darkness to illumination  I avoid mentioning this in response as it is often taken as an insult  You don't change   You adapt    You hit the nail on the head right here   You are a good person  and you understand what she is going through  But if she isn't giving you the opening  you can't force it  I guess just be there if she contacts you  Everyday  Yeah I'm not usually doing good  Sine days are better than others but not many  And I'm not on meds so the good days are farther apart Why post that though   Do you go up to children with broken arms and say "be glad you still have an arm"  "death as a cure for life "  This is a beautiful statement  it encapsulates everything to me   I've only tried lexapro in terms of legal drugs  though THC has always helped me  But recently stopped mainly from lack of funds  difficulty finding it  cause illegal  and pressure from docs and family  I just wish the worldwide legalization of thc would speed up  yeah I know it turns me into a zombie  but at least I'm enjoying myself and not getting image flashes of a noose around my neck   I definitely can relate to my food intake effecting my mood and physical condition  I  try  to stick to unprocessed foods  more greens than meat  and as little bread as possible  But  as I said  I try  and I havent been sticking to any sort of diet lately    I have read about paleo and keto as interesting options for treating health issues  but I havent taken the time to plan a meal routine    This being said  I do love food  and I cant really think of any foods which I dont enjoy  but I would like to stay away from dairy  gluten  bread  and things like these  Other than that  I love most vegatables and most meats  and cheese  omg its hard to stay away from cheese   I sure would appreciate you taking the time to share some recipes with me  I would appreciate it very much    Again  thank you so much for the support and sharing this awesome info  Ahh interesting   Thank you  D I feel you on those child hood reminicions and the days when you didn't have a care in the world  It was good for anxiety  it did cause some digestive issues but they weren't intolerable  but it made me manic when we pushed the dose too far  Shortly after using it I experienced psychotic symptoms for the first time  After that came the worst depression of my life   If we had stayed at 20 mg vs pushing to 30 and not have gotten rid of an adjunctive mood stabilizer I think it might have been OK and worth holding on to  YMMV  My insurance has hoops I need to jump through    First step is going to your primary  They won't prescribe you meds you need unless it's like ibuprofen on a flu med  Everything else needs a specialist    Then they tell you to call psychiatry to make the initial appointment with a  social worker   Those are easy enough  Except the person put words into my mouth and I had to correct them a million times  They need to write that you need meds and that you need therapy  Can't get just one at the same place  And this appointment was just medical history and such which could be looked up by a click of a button  Since my medical history is in their system   Then you go to make appointments  For meds they need to make a psychiatrist appointment  For therapy  a psychologist visit    Psychiatrist is only a month wait  At which rate I haven't had my meds since August  And everyone just keeps assuming I somehow have them still  But they only prescribe you things    Now you need a psychologist visit for therapy  Those are 2 months wait  And that's just whoever available first    So now the latest appointment they can make is during your work hours because  like them  you have an 8 4 30 job  I have to spend   each appointment while missing income  I can't take a lot of time off from work or I won't have a job therefore won't have insurance   But the social worker did give me a nice printout of suicide hotlines  in case I decide to do something crazy  because it's not like the psychiatry department can help me anytime soon  Oh  and I'll need to prove to the psychiatrist that I do  in fact  need the meds and would like them back  But wait  they don't prescribe one of my old meds by this provoder  Which means a new drug all together or none at all   So here's me with my psychiatrist appointment later this month and a therapist appointment next month  I wonder how much longer do I get to be miserable  Because no meds since August is rather bad   how old are you  I feel you are hesitating because somewhere inside you  you know that there is a life of your choosing once you can live on your own At least you got to pick your therapist  Mine just threw me to whoever is available in this giant place  Hallo nochmal    Hello again    How are you today  Would you like to tell more about the SNAFU    Not feeling motivated is very common during depression  and understandable considering what you have been through  You may feel exhausted and hopeless  like nothing is worth doing  You may feel afraid to try anything in case it brings more pain  None of this is fun  but you're not alone  Try to remember that you are still loveable even if you achieve nothing  And maybe there is a small bit of wisdom in your lack of motivationperhaps people in your life are pressuring you to do things you don't want to do  Sometimes we rebel by becoming apathetic  because deep down we know we are meant to do what pleases us  and not just what impresses others  Much use those are  Look through the posts  There are many poets per day with people calling and the person on the other side either hangs up  tells you to such it up and that it's not that bad  or even to go do something crazy   Hotlines exist  But they're not filled with trained psychologists who give a damn or at least try to  It took me a few tries but I have a good team of doctors   The lab work found mine and with the supplements she recommended I m feeling so much better   But please dont start taking any until you get the workup done  vitamin poisoning is a very real thing   Be smart  good doctors that don't want to force you into a starvation diet or invasive surgery do exist  I am worried because she mentioned not having gear or money to buy gear    How have you been coping  Heya   how are things going on yo end kiddo  I checked myself into a psych ward and may get zoloft tomorrow   do you know anything about that  Feel better too homie   I pray for us all  I definitely relate with you here  "Recovery " whatever it means or entails  would be hard  terrifying  unfamiliar  and who knows if it'll be worth it in the end or if it'll even work  It's hard to remember who you were before this  That's something that depression does to you that keeps you from improving   At this point  I've only taken steps forward because I trust my friends that it's going to be worth it  and it'll be better for them  We'll see how long that lasts  though  High School fucking sucks  hard  From what I here it sounds like your talents are wasted there and you are not understood  Get out or start making a plan  I quit high school a year early  against my parents will  and it was the best thing I ever did  Seriously in long the long it makes no difference   there's so many other options to get a uni  placement if that's what you desire  Do you have any relatives who live near civilization and would let you sleep on their floor  Even just for a week  so you can have a break   I only know what I have read here   but seems like your parents don't know what's best for you   even if they think they do  be strong willed and politely stand your ground against them  Take a mental health day off school and drain the fuck out of that data plan  if your parents complain explain that country internet is shit and you need to be in a place where unlimited fiber optic plans are available  I've found proper 'sleep hygiene' to be the most helpful  though not perfect  Then the meds on top of that ensure that the majority of my nights I have good sleep  I hear how others handle their sleep and cringe to be honest  both bp and healthy  Most things are small and simple but they add up and do help of you stick to them Dang that's really good   It seems whenever people ask me either "how are you doing" or "is everything ok" I always and up saying "I'm good" or the standard "I'm just tired"  anyways I really like your drawing It took months of  trial and error to find this guy  he definitely wasn't my first choice  but there are some out there    It's so much easier to just say that than try and be vulnerable   Thanks so much  Unfortunately psychiatric pills have terrible side effects  oh  That's not so good   Decent winter gear isn't cheap  unless she's car camping and can just retreat to the vehicle when it doesn't go right  that might still be ok  You've been given a golden opportunity for sweet revenge  Don't squander it and fall prey to this game of hers  Best revenge is no response  This is perfect  don't ruin it by validating her and definitely do not give her satisfaction that you still care by telling her how she hurt you  That'll feed right into her ego  Pop her ego with the pin of silence  Good luck and I hope to god you didn't cave and reply   Thanks man  I'm sorry for both of you  Is she going with a group or alone  It can be scary when you feel like you can't help
