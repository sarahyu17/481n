https   www youtube com watch v BnQVaF4FaPo  Don't think of your demons as things you need to get rid of per se  Think of them as things forcing you to endure and get stronger  Seems tacky to pay for your own stuff and not grant a stranger a free ride   I'm calmer  more even minded  I don't immediately start crying when I wake up in the morning and realize how trashed my life is  I am less angry and am getting in fewer violent confrontations on the street as a result  I actually have a bit of peace of mind for the first time in a long time  I never knew what normal was  So I am just thankful my life doesn't seem to be spinning out of control and that I can assume that I won't  over the course of a day  swing into one of those really nasty black depressive moments when all seems lost and I lose my ability reason and work at a level that is basic to functioning in the workplace  Any thing is better than what was before  Thank you science   You plan to get a job then move  That would be the simplest way  and your parents would probably give you less hassle   Policies may vary  so double check with the mover of your choice   When I shipped my car  I was able to load however much I wanted  so long as the mover could see out the sides and back  your car may have to be shuffled on the hauler as they make pick ups and drop offs en route to you  the driver needs to see to move the car    Car movers is one of those industries that have serious issues with con artists   Do your research before hiring someone   Don't be too cheap  it'll bite you in the ass  The comments here  3 as of the time of this writing  are what I expected to read and also what I needed to read   I know I am doing her wrong by staying in this   I am also doing myself a disservice   This is a rebound relationship for her after a failed multiple year marriage   Part of her motivation in pursuing me was to "respond" to her ex husband finding another woman   I have very little relationship experience   I went into this with a "let's try this out" mentality   It was dishonest on my part to stay with her as the hookup stage gradually ended and something else rose in its place   My life plans do not include any permanent romantic partners  kids  or family connections   To the best that I can tell  she is looking for another husband or someone to treat as such   We generally have a good time when we are together   this has been covering up the fact that we are fundamentally incompatible   On the occasions in which we have spoken about it  she has made clear that she is not going to end this   I have to do it sometime soon   for both of us  I was under the impression people got their tonsils out due to strep throat infections   Let it happen naturally  If it's real then she won't care how much money you have or what religion you she is  The state college sounds like a good idea to me  it probably offers whatever you can imagine studying and will be fun  and since you know someone going there thats nice as well  I would be hesitant of your third option because 1  they dont offer a potential major you might end up with  and 2  If you can have the real college experience  i e cost isnt going to kill you persee  then I say do it  Im guessing the cost of the state school is less than the local private school as well  which would be helpful in that aspect  Do whats right for you tho too  Goodluck  You're just giving them a reason not to hire you  Why freely disclose something they cannot ask you about  I'd love to believe we live in a perfect world and they won't discriminate against something they shouldn't in the hiring process but let's be real  We live in the real world and self disclosure of this during the hiring process is the absolute wrong move  Discuss accommodations after you're hired   I have plenty of empathy for people who deserve it  You put the word advice in quotes but that doesn't make it not true  People keep saying it because it is true   Damn you know what's funny  My dad is the same  apart from that he decides to drink himself to sleep most nights and forget about me  Happy New Years btw  just struck 12 for me over here  Anyways  you're dad and his friend seem to be dicks  you do not need to worry about being too nice at this point  if you Dad and his mate were drunk  or theyre just arseholes  don't stand for that bullshit  If you let it slide then it won't stop most likely  It might be hard to speak up at first but trust me it's worth it  If this happened once and nothing similar has happened since then don't worry at all mate  I want to die too  I have a bottle of xanex  Ugh there's a little part of me that says things WILL get better and I don't wanna miss it  Try and have a little hope and hold on to it  That's what I try to do Make sure to offer to bring something   if they say nothing  bring wine or champagne   Have fun Yes  I am penitent of the mistakes I made when I was young   all of them have something to do with women  I know a guy who talks so slow and a lot of people thinks he is stupid  He looks like a human version of a sloth  so slow in his movements and that all   One time when he had to present a class in highscool he couldn't handle it and ran away from the class  It was so weird  no one laughed when he left and neither when he came back   He was my friend and i knew him kinda good  he was intelligent  more intelligent than a lot of people  but when i was talking wit him i felt like he never knew what to say  so i guess is so like your situation   He writes great too and explains everything in detail when writing   I don't think you or him are stupid  maybe you are not good at being spontaneous and talking  I'm kinda like that except that i can talk about deeper things with people  but is something that you don't really want to do until you know that person for a long time or because the theme of conversation cames naturally   Practice makes things better  Also getting checked by a profesional helps a lot  Hope things get better for you  I always broke up with my girlfriend before valentines day    Once  I got lucky  We had planned to spend the night together at my place and the day before she left my present at my place and said "but don't open it "    I said OK sure  Then I broke up with her  and because the gift was at my place  I kept it   While this doesn't really apply in this situation  getting into someone's personal space can be an effective tool in social situations  It's your choice   Everyone make a choice   I was engaged without a engagement ring on    How do you know  Were you there with me  You don't know shit  r all people keep asking questions and giving advice are too vague  They also tell us to do things that we are unable to do because we're socially inept  or that we failed attempting to do  If you're going to try to help us  at least be specific  and don't attack the people who need help  Thank You very much for your kind offer    Hope you have a great 2017 too   Turned 27 this Christmas Eve  No BF  I try to be positive and continue to improve my life   I want to quit smoking   Little detrimental that I just bought a pack in a guilty depressed haze  That's so sad   The thing is   if I wanted to talk to a girl   social anxiety kicks in    if I had the courage to talk ill be worries if she is too religious that she will call the authority for sexual harassment or if she is a gold digger she'll laugh at me for being too nice polite  I'm more to compliment than to say a pick up line or a joke  I knew quite a few people that went to school while still technically in a relationship back home  All of them broke up eventually  and most were worse than if they had just done it to begin with after high school  For example guy meets girl at school  guy starts liking girl  current HS girlfriend gets wind and thinks guy is cheating on her  they fight  she makes everything more dramatic than it should be  guy breaks up with HS girlfriend but shes still way too clingly  guy can finally move on and enjoy college  I know of 2 people whoever who dated on and off through college and they met in highschool  they probably broke up a good 5 times but ended up getting married  they are not what i would call a good marrage  More trouble than its worth IMO save yourself now  It's possible that you are either bored or tired of same food   Why not try new and different food that you never tried before   Try stopping being picky   Trust me  you will like new foods with your tastiness  Congrats  my man  I'm proud of you   Anytime   And thanks for responding   Aww  I'm glad    Your  enthusiasm will hopefully get my butt out running tomorrow morning   P Your brother is going out  Big deal    u alphasfa wanted to comment but couldn't  so here is their PM     Hi there  Muslim here     I ended up on your post while browsing through "new"  This one caught my eye and I clicked on it  Decided to check it out  I wouldn't be surprised you don't like Islam  After all  you've only seen the radical side of it     Now you've only mentioned two points in your post so I'm just gonna peacefully explain them as well as I can     First of all  you mentioned the part that says kill all non believers  That part is true  Yes  it is  BUT what people fail to see is context  This was said during a war  Not before the war  not after the war  During the war  Which means "specifically kill THIS army"  That army is long dead now  And afterwards  Quran ordered Muslims to no longer disturb any non Muslims  "To them their religion and to you  yours"  Now if certain extremist groups  atheists and Muslims both  take all this in the wrong context  that's not Islam's fault     That being said  we discuss the issue of Muhammad  S A W W  and his wife  They lived in a desert 1400  years ago in the scorching heat and lack of food  They were completely different people  physically  For example  if you compare someone living in the mountains  they'll have stronger lungs and legs than someone who lived in a seaside city all their life     Just like that  girls at that time hit puberty very  very fast  Lifespans weren't very long  average age was 60   People matured and died earlier  Aisha  R A  married Muhammad  S A W W  but lived with her parents until she was ready to go live with her husband  She stayed his wife until he passed away  She was a best friend to him and he was to her     Since I am Muslim  now what's my duty  Shall I kill every non believer I see and marry a man asap  Not at all  I have many Christian friends and a boyfriend at the age of 19  I'll marry whenever I am ready  The average life expectancy is 70 80 years now  I have a long time to decide what I wanna do with my life     Islam isn't a bad religion  It's basic concept is love  belief and brotherhood  But if you take it out of context  or if you judge every Muslim in the world based on jerks like ISIS  that's not very fair  Please feel free to ask me anything you want  I'm willing to explain  and the reply for anyone interested     I judge no one on anything besides their behaviour  I just really don't like Islam  Thank you for the response  and the clarification on the context     Think of it this way  How many times have you heard of a radical Islamist performing an act of terrorism  It's in the news practically everyday  Now think of how many times you heard of an act of terrorism in the name of Christianity or Buddhism  I personally can't recall any  It's clear which is more peaceful  and I don't believe in them either  Even if the basis of the religion were to be considered good  then Islam wouldn't be outright 'good'  That's for the reason that just like any other religion  Islam has far transcended the simple concept of belief in something  and is now a  growing  community  The community is led by the same motives  but is understood differently by several factions     This would mean that the theoretical removal of the source would eradicate both the good and the bad  which some people are torn between  I mean sure  we can remove the bad  but what about all the innocent people     There are so many misunderstandings of your book that it causes me certain doubts as to whether it was written by someone who truly believed in the causes you mentioned  I don't think my opinion will change regardless of how good an argument someone pits  but I still believe that Muslims do not believe in peace fully  even if they say and think they do     I also would just like to say again that I hold no negative opinion on Muslims besides those who follow the Qu'ran in a way harming other people  just like I'd hate anybody who follows some of the rules within Leviticus     Edit     Sorry for the text wall  Might edit     Edit 2     Edited From  Wikipedia  https   en wikipedia org wiki Auditory processing disorder       is an umbrella term for a variety of disorders that affect the way the brain processes auditory information  1  Individuals with APD usually have normal structure and function of the outer  middle and inner ear  peripheral hearing   However  they cannot process the information they hear in the same way as others do  which leads to difficulties in recognizing and interpreting sounds  especially the sounds composing speech     nbsp   I am not a doctor  so take my attempted explanation ELI5 with a grain of salt  From what I understand  people with APD hear you just fine  their ears work well  but their brain may have some trouble interpreting what they heard  especially speech    You know how some people can't understand you  at all  when you talk to them in clubs or loud environments  They may have some degree of APD  they are actually hearing what you're saying  but their brain has trouble differentiating your words from the background noise    I suppose it's like needing glasses  You know it's a tree  you see the little leaves  even if they're blurry blobs   But you may not be able to figure out what kind of tree it is exactly because it's all blurry    My uneducated mind thinks APD is more of a spectrum  I've used that particular example because you'll find a ton of people that can't understand speech very well in loud environments even when the words are clear  myself included  I have also a hard time with phone videoconference conversations unless they're high quality  not that unusual either   Almost everyone else is already taken by that age and grills look for guys with relationship experience  who are ready to have a child with and spend the rest of their lives with  not inexperienced losers like us   Some   American girls are spoiled  The percentage of girls that fit the behavior you're describing is very small  but unfortunately they dominate our perception because they make the most noise   You could just as easily say the same thing about guys  having ridiculous standards  having tons of sex  etc  These types of guys exists  and are just as common as girls like how you describe  they are known as "Chads"  But they are in the small minority just like the girls  There are a ton of girls who aren't spoiled  who are virgins  and don't spend a ton of time out and about having fun  Just like us   Unfortunately  we interact with this kind of person less than the kind you describe  which leads to the imbalance in our perception  we see a lot more of the spoiled type with ridiculous standards than the down to Earth type  Join anything  local clubs  work  sports  college  ect  If your 21 theres no reason you cant go out and enjoy new years at any bar anyways  and your bound to meet people there even if it is only for the night  friends dont have to make the night for it to be a good one  I lasted maybe 3 or 4 months  I didn't feel any different  granted I was just trying it to see if anything happened  Honestly  I think masturbation is normal and healthy in moderation   Take an engagement vacation instead   From my understanding they do  That's how they catch people who steel phones and go through another carrier   I recommend you Ender's Game  the novel  It's about this ruthless about oneself  the conflict between being violent and wanting to be kind at the same time   I think the solution is to accept our own imperfection  and become more "gray" evaluating morals  It's not always your fault and you have no obligation to be good with all the people all the time  so it's ok to break a glass  kick a trashcan or punch someone in the face if he is harassing you  Don't bother to think about your friends   Focus on your life   You have to find new friends   New Year's Eve may be important but it's "Getting drunk  dudeeeee" holiday    If you really want to do something  call your different friends then   Tonight  I am going to my friend's house for redbox movie and wine cheese   Nothing news  really  OK  maybe 2016 wasn't quite as shitty as everyone's been saying   Congrats  Hope it doesn't happen again mate  Shit happens ya'know  Hope you're doing well if I ever see you again  i desperatly need them  but they won't be there for me  This meme is unfuriating Basically its just the extremeists saying to kill non believers i dont believe killing a non believer is the correct thing to do and majority of the muslims believe this too Also i wouldnt go near anyone below the age of 18 majority of the time child marriages happen mostly in third world countries is because of culture not religion although i did hear once someones finishedwith puberty theyre considered an adult but again majority of people wouldnt touch a child in that way its the same with most muslims just a few that do and i find them disgusting  I don't understand how you can make those assumptions  Are you saying that people that are very religious make false sexual assault allegations    Not all women are bad or have evil intentions  Just like not all men are bad  Trust your instincts whether they are a good decent person or not  I'm a "normie" and I don't get any pleasure out of bringing people down  Those people bullying you are probably losers themselves trying to make themselves feel better  Don't let internet trolls bring you down  they don't know you  Take everything they say with a grain of salt  Well  if it wasn't for your friends idea then you wouldnt have anything create in the first place  He DESERVES at least half   Yeah that's the right thing to do  he's just such a fragile person though   Guess I'm too soft of a guy  but it has to be done  Congrats yo  I didn't kiss anyone until I was 20  so I know the feeling     Now  to the more important part  I hope you used a condom  you're too young for kids    99  of elephant seal bulls wander the seas as lonely bachelors their entire lives   If this world was designed  it was designed by a sadist  Don't have a father figure   mom and dad got divorced when my mom was pregnant    saw my dad in vacations only and cuz of my shitty mom I doubt EVERY thing I do wether if should I do it or no Alright I responded a bit agitated and I apologize for that  Oh no it's fine I don't mind questions   When I have an episode like the one I described it does impact me as I do get rather violently ill  I often joke that I would force it upon myself during my high school years to get out of class  But yes  it's quite constantly there  especially in the last few days hence I had to bring it somewhere   I don't imagine myself dying though  it's more the 'after I'm dead' that is the main body  And it's only myself  I mean of course I worry about others but that's nothing different from the average person  Thank you   Good luck   I forgot to mention  both married and have other kids as well   I now have a big unique family   As long as you guys can stay civil and both keep the child first  It will be okay      Also  I loved having young parents   I always felt like they understood me better than my friends parents understood them     Almost like a Gilmore Girls esque thing   Lol  But more my dad and me  female   I hate to rain on your parade  but adoption is a real crapshoot  I've know a few who had a great time with their adoption  they are adults now  but I know a literal sea of ppl  including my wife  who had a pretty shitty time with adoption  If the adoption is within one's family  like an uncle or aunt adopting   it might be good  But random strangers  Even if they are OK ppl  its still very difficult for the child in the BEST of circumstances  ie  stable  good parents    So it is an option of course  but it is NOT without issues  And lets not even talk about shitty adoption agencies  Keep it in the family if at all possible  unless one's family is even worse   Oh I can see how that would be aggravating    I wouldn't want to tell you to change or give vague advice that amounts to 'be different'  And I certainly wouldn't want to attack you   One thing I might offer is self compassion  I see a lot of hurting people in here who are likely harder on themselves than others are on them   Nobody deserves to be spoken to the way many people here seems to speak about themselves     Don't believe everything you think   A thought isn't a truth  it's a suggestion that you can chose to give validity or not   Mindfulness meditation and cognitive behavioural therapy were very helpful in teaching me to accept myself and my thoughts   If you are depressed anxious and frequently find yourself thinking negative things about yourself  I'd highly suggest you look into it    could change your life like it did mine  So  did you tell her that she was your first   Also  how did it go  Did you know what you were doing  Did you finish really fast   My first time I had no idea what I wad doing but my girlfriend at the time knew that  and was a very good teacher   Congrats  hope it works out for you man   I have a nice boyfriend  You're not one of us  Please trust me that when your sugars get under control the fatigue will disappear   Type one is a difficult  lifelong struggle but there are enormous resources out there for you  Please pm me if you want  Ahh  miss communication I see  Happens to all of us   Looks are one hundred percent a factor because the basic urges that compel us to mate are based on physical applications  Saying that looks don't matter is just attractive people telling us that we are ugly politely  Show me Believe me  you would be a FA even if you were in a developing country  The grass isn't greener on the other side  You would get some flings because you would be "exotic"  nothing else    Source  Non American redditor  Ball out  Enjoy the experience  You don't have to pretend to have fun with the girl if you aren't feeling her  Just treat her as a friend you're spending New Years with  Lessen the pressure  Happy NYE  Talk to your friend and determine shares of the proceeds from the percentage of work you each do  Maybe the friend gets an automatic ten percent for the idea  but has to help make it happen to get more  Whatever you decide  write that shit down  Sounds like the first thing you need to do is get some distance between you and your family  Get some independence and discover who you really are  I have no idea about your financial position so I understand this might be very hard for you    There's a saying "you cannot love anyone until you love yourself" And this isn't mean in an arrogant way   You need to be able to trust your own decisions and not worry if things don't pan out because that how life works  You win some you lose some  You're still young but life is too short  Figure out what exactly you aren't happy with in your life and  change  it So     what are  you  doing to

person and that I seem to have an "attitude problem"   Whatever that means   So there  Your question has been answered  Thank you  I'll try  I have to  Personally I've known people who spent several thousand on an engagement ring  and always thought that was insane  My wife and I both saw eye to eye on this  which was nice  From our perspective the money is better spent on a future home  I ended up spending about  500 on a custom ring and we were both very happy with the result   Some good advice I've received regarding marriage in general is "happy wife  happy life"   Is your objection to the ring purely on financial practical grounds  What is the root of her desire for one  I suspect there is a comfortable middle ground that will make you both happy  Fuck   were you mostly playing videogames like me  My grandfather had a stroke and nobody told us  I had to find out through someone else    on OkCupid  Let's not use an online dating site that the overwhelming majority of people don't use to determine what goes on in real life  Hugs to you     No it actually isn't  Doing nothing and being excluded on a day where most people  even people who don't generally party usually find something to do  is a reminder how we really don't have friends  My best friend rear ended a guy by texting while driving  I always tell her not to  She never thinks anything will happen  It took everything I had to not scream "I told you so" at her  Edit  grammar error I thought it would be uplifting because the whole thread is full of stories   There's a guy who has a decent amount of upvotes describing how he is going to meet up with his family and his dog to celebrate  so I don't see how exactly my post would be seen as assholish   I don't know what this sub is  true  But if people are triggered by the mere statement that   I'm going to a restaurant to celebrate   than this sub is truly way lonelier than I though  Truly saddening  That verse is specific to one particular battle  the Battle of Badr  It is a battle in which a large Meccan army traveled to make war on the muslims  It is not a catch all verse designed to say kill all non believers  Even if you read a bit after that verse you will find some more information that refutes your understand    Verse 8 19   If you  disbelievers  seek the victory   the defeat has come to you  And if you desist  from hostilities   it is best for you  but if you return  to war   We will return  and never will you be availed by your  large  company at all  even if it should increase  and  that is  because Allah is with the believers   Even near the end of the Chapter  verse 61  lays it pretty bare   And if they incline to peace  then incline to it  also  and rely upon Allah   Indeed  it is He who is the Hearing  the Knowing  For me  I had to force myself to go out more    I spent two months where everyday I hung out with someone even though I was working 3 jobs at the time   I tried to not make it the same person all the time   I would reach out to old friends   A lot of it was me having to go meet them   And every time I went out with friends  I made it a goal to make one new friend  Just to get my extrovert back    I also made myself exercise    And I HATE exercising  I didn't do much  about 30 mins   This may sound weird  but I would put in my calender a future alerts privately  around a month out  with something motivational from things like  get you shit together or who did you meet today  reminder  what can you do today to further your career   I did them so randomly that sometimes they would even take me by surprise   I did one like a year out once saying by this time you better have a better job and be living on your own  and strangely enough  I had    It made me feel really good    My inner voice is mean  so my reminders were usually mean like my inner voice left them   Lol     The idea of a woman wanting to be intimate with me seems very foreign to me too  despite it being something I crave   In most third world countries marriages are set up between families in order to ensure a better social foothold  So even then you would be overlooked  Also I fail to see the allure of having to relocate simply to date someone  If anything that just solidifies your failures  No  I have  10k I could easily spend  it's just the practicality blog addressing behavior that I intend to alter and or extinguish in the following year   maybe something for others to consider or not    This is the theory I accept the most  I must have done something horrible in my past life in order to be punished in this way  She was 100  on board for that and what we originally decided on There are all kinds of traditions that people don't care for and don't follow   Unfortunately  it's concerning that your GF only "reluctantly agreed" to your opinion with regard to this tradition   That tells me that you and she are not on the same page about this and that she places value in having an engagement ring even if you don't      If she really does want one  I think you ought to gladly get her a ring out of your love for her  no arguments  no guilt inducing statements  etc          A minimum of 12 bus journeys a day  That  um  that seems like a  lot   Where do you live  how far are you from the school  How much  time  does this take  Where I grew up the school district provided a bus for all students who lived far enough away that they couldn't reasonably be expected to walk   have you talked to the administrators at your kids' school  Do you have neighbors or friends or family who could be talked into driving your kids to school  or failing that  bribed   I'm not sure if your supermarket is the same  but when I was working at one  managers are around the grocery workers more and have to talk to them more  telling them what to do   so it might just be exposure  The deli department doesn't seem to be visited by managers that much  Ive actually done both myself  i had a job while i was at university and it was nice in the bank account and time aspect back then but i only got it because I hated my school and most of the people i knew there wernt people i genuinely enjoyed being around  fast forward a year transfered out into a new school and things were great  i didnt get a job because I didnt want one at the time and if i had decided to it wouldve been on campus very part time  problem was I got a little  actually very  too far into the drug scene and ended up failing out so take that for what its worth  IMO college is all about meeting people and having a good time and if your spending all that money to go to a school 200 miles away  you might as well enjoy it on its own without the job  Maybe plan on leaving the job and try and join a bunch of things that interest you on campus  or change your living arrangements at school if that might help  Hope it works out for you  yeah  it's just hart to accept that they don't care   and that I'm alone I would hate for that to happen    I'll keep it in mind  Thank you   Fact of the matter is  being good looking allows guys to open the door to contact with women  that door doesn't even exist most of the time for people without stellar looks   If it makes you feel any better  the same is true for 90  of men   As a man  you have to be extremely good looking before you consistently get positive reactions from girls based on your looks      Thank you   Ill try my best I hear you   10k is a lot  What is she looking for in the ring  I honestly do not think of it as "embarrassing" one bit   If anything  you're saving yourself from a cycle of embarrassment if you start to lose not only your sanity  but also your friends whether that's through borrowing money  lying  desperation gambling   I'm so glad you've recognized your limits and have made a conscious step in curbing that compulsive feeling to gamble   I wish you the best in your 2017 and hope you persevere and grow on this experience  I'm sure you'll come out a much stronger person  Video games  food  YouTube  memes  Also warm weather keeps me going  You as well  It's infuriating isn't it  So so dangerous   Way to go  guy  It's so awesome that you've found your match     Most men are settled for by women who believe can't get Chad anymore once she hits 30  oh she's not  it's the community that's now in revolt What do you think vitamins and supplements are for  I'm a cisgender woman  But damn  that's sort of a rude question  no   I wouldn't say picky  Particular is a better word  I'm someone who doesn't fall for every girl he sees  and  at twenty seven  have only been interested in maybe five or six girls  A problem that people don't seem to grasp is that all humans are creatures of habit  We get up and go to the same job and meet the same people  go home and go to bed  day after dreary day  The chances of us actually meeting someone new is severely against us  and the chance that  if you do  that person having any interest in you is also against you  That's just the cruelty of reality for us  We are all victims of circumstances    is he okay  I don't know if your family is close but yeah  someone should have informed you at least  Hoping he is  Yes you have to  Just remember you are not alone  Things can get better  Peace and love  Please don't try this at home  http   i imgur com IyW6ujw jpg  Gotcha  I was asking because you said she'd agreed 'reluctantly'   Forget that noise from others  The only thing that really matters is what you both want  As long as you're on the same page you will be fine  Good luck ring shopping  Good for you I will be enjoying it at home again with the company of my dog  Ya don't feel good about it guess we'll just send it back to wind    I'm someone who's dealt with a very modest appetite most of my life  Too many carbs will sustain you  but they will leave you drowzy and unmotivated  I suggest eating meats  Something high in protein like chicken or turkey would probably be best  The nutritionalist is right though  You need to get fruits in your diet to balance out what you've already been taking in  The acids in fruit should help breakdown what's already in your stomach and should regulate your stomach acid  An apple or two a day could definitely help  I wish you the best of luck  No  you did the right thing  They were doing something extremely dangerous  extremely stupid and you probably saved one of them from losing a limb  How shitty do you think NYE would be   then    It sounds like your husband is trying to guilt trip you out of malicious childishness  yeah  good point  I'm kind of hard on want v need   yeah  good point  I'm kind of hard on want v need   No offense meant by this  but I don't think you could've made that sound any more scary    haha thanks  Life would be easier with a penis  I would never have to worry about pregnancy    Alas   vagina   Don't smoke weed while you're sick  It'll just make you feel worse  Talking from experience  I am by no means a mental health professional  but many of the symptoms you describe sound like those associated with schizophrenia  I would absolutely discuss this with a psychiatrist     27 year old virgin who is definitely fat  I know people on here don't like to hear this sometimes  but you can do something about this  I up voted but I'm not alone   I've got a master hunter with me  Oh and he is German  That's a lie  it is jagermeister  tear emoji  Any statistical sources for this  And this comment doesn't refute my claim that the statistic you did give is flawed  If you do  just a hit or two at a time  The smoke won't be good for it  but the buzz might carry you over the annoyance of sickness for a while  Speaking from experience  See I would totally be into hanging at someone's house with their dog  I grew up catholic and i can definitely relate  went to all the catholic schools and all  and i am not one for organized religion  I consider myself agnostic  The Church is fucked up  and the fact that anyone can acknowledge it as anything other than brainwashing is just beyond me  My father will go as far as to make fun of people who question ANYTHING written in the bible  if you dont agree with the church's interpretation of it  then your wrong in his eyes and he wont even listen to the other side on that topic  Needless to say living with them was and is  unfortunately had to move back home  a chore  If your 17 college must be a possibility  especially for a conservative family  So id say wait it out until you can get out and just go to a university that isnt conservative and christian  you probably just need a change or something   If you want to befriend more people  go for it  You'll find the right crowd soon enough  Don't worry about people judging you  Most people don't judge others very much  and if they do  they're shitty people who you don't want as friends   Stop calling yourself an introvert  It will only hold you back  I  too  am introverted  but I put myself out there anyways  and it's very rewarding   This natural awkwardness you speak of wears off with more and more interactions  It also is magnified in our own heads   Your friend   An ex lonesome teenage boy Take it from a veteran from the dating scene  You are better off to get out of the rat race   I am FA for decades and loving it   Do whatever you want  any time you want No drama   More money than you can spend     Retire early     I'm basically in the same boat  I'll be 28 this year  It sucks because I'm the oldest of my siblings  and whenever my parents bring up grandkids at family outings everyone looks at me  I'm the furthest away from kids out of the 3 of us   Where in the states  Like Canada  the US is massive keep in mind that 3 countries make up most of NA  and the weather is incredibly variant depending on location  To say that the weather in the states is pretty good would be like saying that the weather in Europe is pretty good  No  do not do this  It's basic alpha fux beta bux   Not everything needs scientific sources because it doesn't fit your world view I look at it this way   Tonight is 'amateur drunk driving night'  Too many people getting drunk and all  Even if you took a cab everywhere   and did the responsible thing  some jackass that thought he could drive home crashes into the cab you're in       I know this cause I was that jackass once   Ahhh I see  absolutely    I didn't think of it that way but yeah makes sense  Thank you    Yeah  and she's totally gonna get in bed already wet at the thought of my massive culture and personality    PLEAASEEEEE After a couple of conversations I attempted to carry out through text  I have learned this  phone them  or wait til you see them in person  Texting is one of the worst ways to talk to people  It never ends well  The tub is still clogged if it's not draining after your bath  There should be no back up  Cleaning the tub after every use is a better way to keep it clean than cleaning once a month  But you should tell the apartment manager that your tub is backing up and that you tried cleaning out the drain yourself and it hasn't fixed the problem  Good job bud   continue the good work and stay positive  That's a lot accomplished  Wow  great job   Very brave of you OP  Good luck tomorrow     Ah ok so we're using idiotic  internet  PUA lingo that no one in the real world either uses nor knows about to make claims now  Gotcha  It's draining just fine  Maybe I didn't do a thorough enough job though     Yeah I guess it's not so much about erasing the negative symptoms entirely  but I think of it as learning new healthy coping mechanisms and ways to live with them  To think and then act differently  not succumbing and getting defeated by them  Some medications also just seem to just stop a flood of negative emotions that would otherwise spiral out of control  Like  on some meds  I feel like crying but am  physically unable to  shed a tear somehow Cool story   I am  Got off the meds that made me balloon up  Changing my diet  Already dropped two pant sizes  Consulting my doctor  about possible PCOS  not confirmed  but my doc is keeping tabs because I have a lot of the symptoms and I exhibit "1 5 of 3 symptoms"  his words     Taking it slow  as I already have sagging loose skin from weight loss and I don't want to look like the Pale Man from Pan's Labyrinth   I honestly don't know  When I was 21 I said I'd kill myself at 23 if I still never kissed anyone  and 25 if I was still a virgin  Here I am at 27 still kicking  I just keep going on somehow   It'll be pretty cold I'm in wisconsin which is roughly as north  but I'm not sure how the altitude and westward position will affect the temps  Hard to say really  but the west coast is generally considered to be a good place to be by a large portion of the population  If you're liberal or even moderate  for your politics you'll likely fit in pretty well too  I'm considering schools in that area and the natural landscapes and progressive worldview are big things that draw me to the area  Patent it  then he can go suck a horse cock  Thank you for your response  Any advice on how to talk to them in the morning  I feel like my husband's friends might think I am a terribly boring and inconsiderate person    I would like to apologise for the way I reacted  but I don't feel like I need to apologise for my action of stopping an uninformed use of fireworks I see what you're saying and logically it makes sense but some part of me wants the satisfaction of knowing I'm competent enough of a human being to maintain a SO type relationship for a long period of time  I'm kind of doubtful that's the case though     However  if I want to take a bath instead of a shower  the tub fills with scummy water   So this means when you fill the tub  the water is scummy right out of the tap  Is the water in your sink scummy  The toilet   Fill a water glass with water from the tub's spout and look at it  If it's scummy  you've got a problem with your water pipe to the tub  That's not right  Talk to the landlord  Last night I finished work at 11  came home and treated myself by having a bath  as opposed to my usual shower  and went to bed  Today my family went to the beach and I couldn't go because I have to work again today  I actually cried this morning  Still gets rid of tonsil stone breath Happy New Year  You are not alone  Strength in numbers  Just remember  tomorrow is another opportunity   I'll keep you in my thoughts as I sip on a brown derby alone    Say the exact same thing back in the exact same way  This genuinely works  We can only contact facebook via their automatic support email system  sadly Are we the defunct ones for not feeling the urge to snapchat pictures of ourselves  or of anything for that matter  to total strangers  or have our faces buried so deep in our phone that we can't even avoid running into people  I'm 25 years old and I feel like I'm mentally 75  cursing social media and technology  and the need for self boasting it has created  I'm not that great  neither are you or anyone else  As a single creature we are absolutely worthless  But as a society we are worse than worthless  We are  self  destructive  Am I broken for not jumping into ego wars with everyone around me  There was a hashtag trending years ago saying something like   "I love nerds"  95  of the guys posted were models with glasses or a model with a dragon ball z tshirt on   Thanks  but we can only contact facebook via their automatic support email system When you talk to people you're close with  examine your mannerisms and speech patterns  See how the conversations begin  escalate  and end  Apply this knowledge to new conversations  Lol wtf are you even talking about  So many assumptions and it's hilarious  Thanks for the free entertainment  I'm not really big on politics in general  Although I'm into a clean city and lots to do and outdoorsy things   Considering that  A  You didn't own the property  B  They didn't know how to operate fireworks  and C  There wasn't any safety equipment laying around  you did the right thing  Like  if the fireworks detonated and the apartment building  not your room but the building itself  caught on fire  well that won't sit too kindly considering all the terror scares going on  Also  how would you guys pay for any property damage and medical charges    " My husband told me I need to take more risks and that     I should had let his friends hurt themselves     if they wished to do that  That it is     not my place to micromanage them     "  That's bullshit  You  being the reasonable and caring human being you are  were looking out for your husband and his friends  That's really shitty and childish for him to say though  No  Not at all  I don't understand it either   Some of us are just Ferdinand the bull   trying to be good people getting drug in the ring with a matador against our will   I don't get it    Nothing is wrong with you  though  I think there is something wrong with everyone else  you weren't drunk enough  Feel free to ignore this  because I don't got no advice  Because usually  in this case  I'm the clingy one who has no friends  However  I've had a few people who were clingy to me years back  and inwas brutally honest with them  I highly suggest you're not though  since I felt like a huge piece of shit  As time passed they understood  keep in mind then guy had problems too  The KKK is a protestant based

hasn't helped in the FA department  but I feel and look better than I ever have  I was a 36 waist and now I wear a size 30   As a former escort I can't possibly agree with you any more  Most of the time you are selling your body and your mind  It is a basic need and there's no real reason for anybody to go without other than stigma    OP  keep doing what your doing as long as it pleases you  you've done nothing to be ashamed of  I'd say the only reason not to is if it's negatively affecting your life and or finances   Friend  I'm so sorry that you're dealing with all of this  I'm sorry that you can't find mental health care professionals who understand your needs  I'm sorry that you're so  understandably  terrified of your parents taking control  And  of course  I'm sorry for your past and current suffering   Are you currently in school  For someone as intelligent as you  I think that higher education could be a great help to you  to put you  in a better situation  I don't know if you can work  but if you can  then education can open doors that will allow you to live more comfortably  even if it won't get rid of your everyday struggles  I entered several of the monthly contests on  r proceduralgeneration and even won one of them   In other news  my hobbies are still dorky as all hell  If you've cleaned your tub and the water is gross  then the problem is the water coming from the tap  Talk to the landlord  this is a maintenance issue  Notes  gifts  etc  If you want to do it in person  do your best  It won't be perfect  but it won't be bad either  Practice make oerfct  Well at least I'm not alone in that aspect  Although it's hard to believe there's enough people that care to actually change anything  I can't even seem to find one in daily life anymore  Yup  If you care  read the sidebar or the  stickied thread  https   www reddit com r ForeverAlone comments 4s20df a thread for new visitors about the sub and its    otherwise just move on    Id be alone  but I got beer  Im drunk bitches  As a teenager I would only take selfies when I was feeling super insecure and could post them somewhere I knew I'd get compliments  It never actually worked for improving how I felt  Eventually I grew out of it  Now I don't take any pictures of myself at all  except when my boyfriend wants some nudes  Lol I've been FA my entire life you dumbass  Again  thanks for entertaining me with your idiotic assumptions about me  Eh  the majority of girls I've met seem to prefer a slimmer build as opposed to a ripped  Hercules esque look  I think it's more like a girl will like you for your looks  stay with you for your personality  I feel the same way Hey congrats  The same thing happened to me  but I was 19 at the time  Guess what  12 years later I'm married to the girl   That almost makes me want to go out even more  Well maybe if you were Chad you wouldn't be FA and I wouldn't be incel if I was Chad   ALL WOMEN WANT CHAD  For fun   https   youtu be lQlIhraqL7o     That clarifies a lot  thanks  in my defense this thread is the only thing I've ever seen about this sub  I look like fucking H3H3  Almost no woman wants that   I need to look like  this  https   tatespw725 files wordpress com 2013 01 how to get six pack abs for men jpg w 480   Not  this  https   pbs twimg com media CHukOUDUwAENWdq jpg  Don't do it out of peer pressure  If you do not want to drink  then don't   But if you honestly want to try it  just have a beer   I really have been considering buying a house but am having trouble deciding on what kind   Do I buy a small house assuming I will be FA forever   Or a larger one in the 1  chance I have a family in the future     Is it worth buying one as a single person    My rent is insane  about  1700  so I feel I would be far better off putting the money towards a property I own  I would take pictures or video of the hose  get concrete evidence  not proof  evidence that they were stealing your water  Then confront them and demand they pay you back for the overage of the water bill  If they decline you sue the shit out of them in small claims court    Talk with your water company and find out how much your bill would normally be without the overages  and total it up and Sue for that amount  If you have concrete evidence  you should have a pretty strong case  Keep talking  You're just making yourself look more and more like a fool  Or maybe you're just a troll  I'm leaning towards the second one   Edit  oh  I see you're a poster on  r incels  Well  that clears things up  You need counseling now MY fear is once I 'accept' being FA and resign myself to it  the rest of me will go     At that point  what's the point in staying in shape   Or getting a shitload of money and having a good career    What's the point of life in general  to retire old and die old and alone   I feel like at least not giving up gives me some kind of a purpose  If they want to fuck themselves up  let them  If they don't whilst doing so  then it will happen eventually and so they will learn another life lesson  On the other hand  grade 3 fireworks in Prague heh  Can't say I wouldn't be up there with them too  Nothing to feel shitty about none the less  people being people  Be glad you're there for them lol  Nice   That's what I was thinking  Thanks  You're better off putting this in a r4r or local sub   Much more people  Turning 28 in less than a month   Fuck my life  "No mames" means stop fucking around or that's unbelievable in a comical sort of way   Cool  Happy New Years  yes nah fuck that  sit on their lap Thank you  I'm always expecting pitchforks around here   I'm so glad you posted  wow  This must really ease his mind  Have a great 2017 and I bet you have some  really  interesting stories  Yeah you don't HAVE to drink in order to have a social life  You can still go to bars and hang out but no one's forcing you to drink  and if they are they're just douchebags and you probably shouldn't befriend them anyway   Giants made the playoffs is a positive  Even year bullshit ended is what made it a positive for me      29 is a shitty ACT score that means nothing Thank you for the kind words  I need this As opposed to old and FA and in a dingy one room apartment     At least the divorced guy had a family at one point    Well  businesses aren't just developers  What can happen offer to make it happen  Is he a good champion  Does he have the ability to sell ice to the inuit  Is he good as UX  Does he have contacts  50  is probably too much  but if you hit it big there wouldn't be much to squabble about   Fuck God  if he's up there he gave us this life  Nope  but I'm depressed and my brain is backwards  Even my shrink said it's normal for alcohol to make depression worse  It makes me more anxious than usual  and that's it  u the aero naut how has it been going in regards to this situation  May I have an update  So there's abortion  there's adoption and there is also total and logical acceptance  You made a mistake  we all do  Accept it  forgive yourself  which you are both currently doing  and just work hard  Yes it'll be tough to manage a kid  school  growing up and working but eh  That's life  deal with it  Be happy  you may have a son daughter  Nothing is impossible is life provided you work hard and you realise the end goals  End goals being having a life and taking care of one  Granted you may not have all the experience but a person will never ever have all the experience they need   You have parents to help  girlfriend to help  her parents to help too  Don't think it's a burden to put responsibility to them  it's not  We are humans  we all take and give  We all can help with each others issues  Just don't be lazy  don't give up and don't forget   Sadly I live 45 minutes from Montreal near Granby    In my experience unemployment only pays out if you are laid off  and not if you voluntarily quit  OMG  this sounds right down my fking street  Bit too late though  took my anger out on my PS4 controller last week    oops  Can't really blame 'em when most girls have hordes of men to choose from  It's no different than companies choosing the best candidates when they have many job applicants  thanks   Well  he never said he did it all by himself  23 yr 40hrs a week OP sounds like the kind of young person whose self awareness you should be championing  not trying to find flaws in  You can't knock a guy for taking advantage of his situation and working hard     Not that I'm aware of   I  too  have spent time with escorts  I feel no shame whatsoever  I get what I want  and the escort gets what they want  No drama  Ultimately  it's cheaper than having an SO who nags and spends all of your money  Get a back brace  Go to a doctor and get a doctor's note for modified work load  Express true interest in learning more about them  Ask questions  strive to know them    But if it's not genuine  they will see through it and you will seem superficial  Yeah  Unemployment don't work if you quit  Or everyone would quit and apply for it and  shit  Well you sure kept that conveniently vague  "A serious illness"  I suppose if you leave it that open ended  anything you say will be true  Not sure the point of saying it though     Infection  genetics  and lifestyle are the most influential causes of disease     Pretty much every doctor I know thinks anyone who gets sick either has an infection  or it "just happened to them"  AKA  genetics   For people in this profession to completely omit the entire lifestyle factor like they tend to do  is insanity   I've owned houses twice  The first one didn't end up financially worth it due to a market crash  I had to move for work and I was underwater so I made it a rental  but as it was a small house in a family oriented town keeping it rented at a useful price was difficult  so as soon as I could sell it for more than I owed  I did  at about 5  below what I originally paid    My current house is small  2br  but in an area known for vacation rentals  so worst case if I have to move to a city for work  or find a partner and need to move somewhere larger I'm pretty sure I can keep it rented and paying for itself even if I can't sell    So  the variables are too numerous to count  but I find it worth it  If it looks like the real estate and job market where you are will let you stay for at least 5 years then it's probably worth it   Go for it say it was inspired  That is me this year   Cheers  Life might get kind of unhappy for her if she always has to justify a want to you    Now would be a good time to loosen up on this rigidity       Whelp  This is how social norms are enforced  If you want to opt out  just stand your ground  If you want to do a shut up ring to keep them quiet  buy a mossanite ring  Utterly brilliant  but less than a thousand all said  All they want is to see something sparkly    Good Luck   Hope it's everything you want it to be    In some interviewing classes I took I learned that almost all questions asked in these kinds of interviews can be answered with just a handful of examples  Try to think of examples of different things you've handled that might apply to situations that the job will entail   For example  I work in retail  so I try to have a situation for customer service  one for leadership  one for problem solving  etc  You can rehearse those answers before the interview to make yourself more comfortable  Nice    I've always been fat  Which is weird  because I'm the only fat person in my family   mom  dad  and brother are all incredibly thin  I somehow got fucked over    But getting on meds for my severe depressive episodes ballooned me up to 340 pounds  Sounds crazy  but it happened  mileage varies with meds  but Prozac really fucked me up    Went off of those  and in July I got on something which was not notorious for weight gain  big thanks to my doc for helping out with that specific issue     When I got my blood tests back  I saw that my triglycerides were high and I was a couple of points away from pre diabetes  so I've been cutting down on sugar and cutting down portions  I have been dropping weight since July  I'll probably be getting a blood test again soon  as I keep exhibiting even more symptoms of PCOS  but hopefully my numbers have improved    I wish that the weight loss was quicker  but without the loose skin   I feel like I know where you're coming from  When I was younger I learned to associate alcohol and drugs with  for lack of a better word  assholes  My parents always set a good example  but seeing the behavior of my peers who drank and did other things left a bad taste in my mouth to the extent that I decided I'd never drink until the legal age  21  and never do drugs   Fast forward a few years to college when I'd met new people  had new experiences  and I did decide to have a few beers despite being just 19  For me it felt right  mostly because the people I was with then were better people  I didn't see this as a betrayal of my "younger self"  just a change in circumstance  It sounds like your situation may be similar   Anyway  your mileage may vary  but I would say to give it a try and have fun  It's your life and you are allowed to change your mind    at the end of the day you are only really accountable to yourself  Ok I am very much like this guy apart from I know when to fuck off and stop acting creepy  The dude clearly feels lonely  I know this because I am too  I am very confident when it comes to talking to people over Steam and online but I always over think in real life situations and end up just sitting there beating myself up about it  Maybe he has more problems than you think  He wrote those paragraphs to apologize to what he said about killing you I assume and I can only think he is going delusional a little  When I appear a little creepy to people  which I rarely do apart from when my insanity and desperation kicks in  they tend to call me out on my bullshit and to back off a little  in which i do   Idk how you're truly going to handle this since I'm usually the OTHER person  but if you known his parents or someone who is related to him it might be worth getting in contact with them and seeing what's actually going on  This is so heavy  What a terrible situation the both of you have been put in   My personal opinion  is that it's not such a bad thing to do internet background checks  However  what they chose to do with the "information" that they found was what I find very wrong  This is a tough situation to be in    I kind of wonder if her parents are maybe feeling anxiety of their daughter being married  and coming up with any odd reason they can  other than just that  to justify being against your marriage   I feel like it's not going to feel right to anyone if you hold this negativity before the wedding  I would do what you can to find peace with the situation  and move on  with or without their blessing  Grats on your first time x2     I also think that sex with someone mutually attracted to you could be mind blowing   Also  I've heard that even when 2 people mutually attracted to each other have sex for the first time  it can still be awkward and not great   So you've got to get a girlfriend and do it a few times to get comfortable with each other before it can become mindblowing  Ask questions in a sincere manner  like you care about their answer  I hope I was able to help somehow  And I wish you well in your endeavors   Well for some reason I can't what've u a norm i e  duck oitbof here That's a good idea  the only problem is that I can't cook at all and we don't go out to eat much so I don't know how to try them  Edit  and thank you for taking the time to answer my question It sounds like a situation I'm dealing with  My soon to be ex is a pathological liar about the people she talks to  She told me she cut off everyone else she was talking to at the time we started our relationship  I come to find out that she hasn't and has continued the whole time since we started  I think she may be bipolar as well    Please read my thread and let me know

Make sure you're using a standard keyboard on mobile   I'm just not having a good last day of 2016  Obviously from my post I don't sound like someone who has good social skills so you expect things to be easy for me  You just trying to make me look retarded  If someone calls someone else a bitch it does not mean he is misogynistic  calling him out on it will piss him off more if he actually isn't one  He might be joking  or just a dick in general  If my sister is going ape shit on me I will tell her to calm down  I'm not a misogynist for it   Don't worry about what others think  but if she wants one you should do it for her   Hah  I may do but I won't be telling them lol  And happy new year to you too  It's difficult to get on disability payment in Australia and took me over a year  the

respond to authority such as police  etc   Don't even get me started on getting behind the wheel as that feels impossible at least in the near future   Gotta learn to walk before you can run  and run before you can drive  right   I've tried volunteering  can do a few hours a week as long as I'm taken to and from by family    The places I volunteer tend to be quiet and slow paced environments  low risk and low responsibility but even if I go for a few months I can still feel anxious about going from time to time   I vomited before my third date and had to quickly freshen my breath and get something to eat at a fast food place even though I usually eat healthy   In fact I often vomit or nearly vomit before dates or asking an acquaintance out   I have to try and relax myself before almost any situation related to study work dates etc   The psychologist had said  I quote  "Everyone experiences nerves  anxiety  and such  but for you it tends to be 10x worse "  Anyway  guess it's time to go job hunting  I'm sure I'm equally capable as everyone else    Everyone vomits on their way to the bus stop  everyone freaks out  shakes and can't physically speak whenever their boss gets angry at them  This stuff is normal  right  The thing is that I know I'm supoosed to eat meat  but I can't mentally get around the texture   And for fruit it's the taste and how cold it is  I know these are just more stupid excuses to keep being picky  I know the answer seems so simple  but I feel so dumb sometimes  I would eat apples  their flavor is not bad  but if they have any dark or soft spots I freak out  I don't know if this has to do with my ocd but if I see anything like that I have to throw it away  I am so frustrated with myself   Edit  also thank you so much for answering  Please seek out your Dr and talk to them about your depression  You can feel better  You might have a chemical imbalance that requires medication  Try to keep an open mind about it and take care of yourself op You play the hand that life dealt you   If romance is not in the cards  so be it   There are other challenges in life  like   be the best in your field  be successful in a business and make a ton of money  walk the Pacific Crest Trail from Canada to Mexico   The opportunities are endless     It's good to hear from someone who has perspective from the other side of this  I will say  that I understood he was lonely and I really wish I could have been a companion for him to talk to  But on the other hand  I hear about all of these stories of cyberstalking turning into physical stalking  And since I know him in real life     I think he lives with his mom  and I do want to help  but I don't know if I should directly put myself in this situation again  Maybe an anonymous letter  Well happy fucking 2017 to you too mate     Cheers Another virgin male here   1  I am about as nerdy as you can possibly get  except for the "do well" in school part  I only did okay in school   But all the other stereotypes I fit perfectly  Shy introverted  scrawny  wear glasses  don't go outside except for work food  work as a programmer  don't care for sports  play video games  watch anime  like sci fi  including star wars and star trek   etc   2  I'm not 30 yet  but I'm close enough  over 25   I think people like Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg have made being a nerd more acceptable in certain parts of the US  but only if you are actually successful  or attractive obviously     In terms of dating  I've noticed that nerdy white guys are fairly successful in my area  but geeky Asian guys still have it very  very tough   I think it's more that online dating and the internet have made it so you don't have to be confined to a small pool of people     Why settle for John from class when you can pick from one of the 400 matches on Tinder  go outside everyday  even if it's just standing on the deck  I was left with no other option than to join the carnival  So cheers to next year being better  Which for me it won't  And it feeeelt so gooood I think t's just that a lot of them don't understand  can't understand   Like depression     Also  this kind of talk belongs in  r Incels imo  It's completely your choice  You don't have to do it out of peer pressure  but you can if you think it would be enjoyable for you  Personally  I think you're putting too much thought into it  It doesn't matter whether it looks "cool" or not  Most people like getting drunk because it's fun  as long as you drink responsibly  You don't even need to get drunk either  A lot of people just have a little bit at a time to ease their nerves and help them relax   Alcohol isn't as big a deal once you start drinking it   Hang in there brother  I don't think im picky   My current standards are a girl with a pulse   In all seriousness  im attracted to a very wide variety of girls   Skinny  large  tall  short  various races   I'm not really limiting myself anywhere   But it doesn't do me any good  cuz im ugly af  You have to eventually understand that you deserve so much more and that you're worth more than being someone's victim  Don't go back   Be strong and walk away for good  Keeping you in my thoughts and wishing you strength   Eh  you know I used to grumble and not care about these holidays as well  Thought it was silly and people got way to caught up in it    Who cares  It's a fun time  Now that I participate in events and "get into it" I find that I have a lot more fun and connect with family friends compared to when I wouldn't participate   That gave me a good laugh which I don't know if that was your intention  but thank you   My point to make is while yes your ideal image is certainly one to strive for  it's not the end of the world if you don't get there  Simply slimming down and toning is also greatly preferred  What I would do  I'd be mad  and just not talk to them for a while till they realize you gone  if they don't  then forget em' and get new friends  you don't gotta wait and see while still being there oh hell yes   i am going to bed with pills long before any of that new years shit is on  This man has won 2016  Congrats OP Showers  lots of em  Also luck and decent appearance   Just kidding  But the last 10 stories I have read from so called 'Ex FA's' were just people that never really been FA or just were at the right place right time   You can apologize for screaming and such  but I definitely wouldn't apologize for the actions you took  Something like "I'm sorry I flew off the handle a bit but I still feel like I made the right decision in removing your ability to set off fireworks  You could have seriously injured yourself or someone else  or even set the building on fire  While I understand that you wanted to celebrate  there were far safer ways to do so  I prioritize your safety above all else and don't want to see any of you hurt " It is up to you if you'd like to remain anonymous but the best way to deal with this without worrying if he'll follow you forever is to contact his Mother  I just hope he doesn't come from a broken household because that may be why he is like this  part of my Dad's alcoholism is part of mine  Still  I'd try it  Better to get in contact and show your concern than blocking him off everything  because that'll usually just make him feel shittier  I understand how bad it really must be for you  I apologise if I made it out to be if I were having a go at you because of how he feels because that is not how I was trying to come across as lol  I completely understand  I have a bunch of my own that are kept close too  Take care  Plenty of people don't like it  Totally fine and normal  Maybe some other forms of intoxication like weed will agree with you more   Okay  everyone else in this thread has given you the standard advice that we both know you already know  you're clearly not an idiot  and you know what you're supposed to be doing  and how to do it  You just don't understand why you aren't    I know how frustrating it can be to get basic good advice that you already know and can't make yourself act on  so please understand  I want to help you break through this  and if you message me I'll give you my   or Skype or something and we can talk and you don't have to be alone when you leave  or while you stay  Okay  But just for a little bit  I'd like you to please work with me here on this     I thought I was before and look how that turned out  I am a weak pathetic fucking idiot woman  I am a fucking stereotype turning statistic  I am going to FUCKING GET KILLED  I know this  So why the fuck am I going to go back   Fuck   Okay  for a moment  let's pretend this is true  You believe it  you're listening to it  so let's take it seriously for just one moment   What is it that makes you  want  to go back  What is it that makes you so afraid of walking away  of living life without him  that makes it so it feels better to risk death to be with him   To put it another way  what would you feel if he got hit by a bus tomorrow  or if he just    changed  Not became better  for you  but just stopped being the horrible psycho that he is  If he became not even a good person  but a morally neutral  emotionally bland and boring one  and just calmly ended it  If he got hit by a bus  Disappeared  Was murdered   What would you feel then  What would you do then  The answers to the question you're really asking  whatever they are  are in  that  place of feeling  of wanting   Like I said  message me if you want to talk  I know you know what to do  and because of that I know you're strong enough and smart enough and brave enough to do it eventually  once you want to do it  and overcome that want  decide to want to do something else  The problem is that right now  you don't really want to  and you need to figure out why you don't   The thing is  it's okay that on some level you don't want to follow the good advice that we both know you know  It's okay to want fucked up shit  learning how to want the right things and let go of wanting the wrong things is the hardest thing humans ever have to learn how to do  so much so that it's very hard to do if you weren't taught it as a small child  But everyone can  Everyone  Even you  Probably especially you  because we both know you understand what he does to you is wrong  and what the "correct" thing to do is  and you understand yourself  and how to control yourself   You'll be able to do it once you want to do it more than you want to stay  so please  think about that and find the reasons that make you want go back  so you can find stronger reasons will that make you want to keep staying away  We already know you can leave  we just have to find what it is that's going to make you want to stay left  I got invited to stuff today but I'm so exhausted that I kinda just wish I could be at home and do nothing  It is your choice  but as for letting your younger self down    Life is constant adjustment  You don't owe your past self anything and can change your mind whenever you want  Imagine it you promised yourself that when you graduated college  you would go see the BEST most ULTIMATE concert in the world  98 Degrees  You aren't obligated to carry through if your current self has learned something new   Why can't gfs hubs father with fiance  Have you ever looked into the eyes of a woman who hates your guts   I have   I would rather be FA  which I have been for decades  If he's with you  that tells me that he wants to be with you  and that he's attracted to you the way you are  I obviously don't know the details of your relationship based on these few paragraphs  but I can't really imagine a guy getting into a relationship with a woman whose body type he finds "nasty" or "ugly " I'm really sorry you feel that way about yourself  I've been there  and it sucks  and I hope you don't let it sour a good relationship  assuming it is one  as I said  I don't know the details     If you two care about each other  then each of you deserves the other  Good luck  Oh  well that's reassuring  Thank you  I live in a small town and my boyfriend's dog goes in between our home and his ex wife's  Right now  she's spending most of her time over there as we're renovating  Not too long ago  we had her over for a visit  we don't keep her leashed in the yard and don't have a fence  never really needed to keep her contained   Well  she ran up to a dog being walked on a leash and right after I yelled  "Don't worry  she's friendly " She just snapped at the dog and kind of started snarling in the dog's face  I had to drag her away and I felt really bad  but I never really thought of the fact that the woman walking her dog could have pepper sprayed our otherwise very sweet  friendly dog  I might consider finding another route to walk if it's a consistent thing in your neighborhood  Dogs are kind of like chemicals  they don't always mix well together  I would definitely consider this but also look after your number one buddy  Y'all heard it here first  Thank you for the comments   I appreciate the advice   You'll get a certificate in the mail soon   Thank you for your comments   I appreciate the concern   Luck   Circumstance   They just met the right person at the right time    I'm a cop caller  Because even if it isn't sound ordinance curfew  it's still disturbing the peace regardless the hour   And I pay good money to live in my home  Not going to have a day or evening ruined by the inconsiderate  You're not an FA  you're an asshole and a "nice guy"  That's the difference between that sub and this one  Ye  I got mine out  as an adult  was horrible  because I was getting my adenoids out to help my eustachian tubes work correctly  I asked the doc to take tonsils out also  he said only if I had multiple sore throats a year to which I replied of course I did  so he was then able to take them out too  Sore throats are no longer as bad as before without something to get infected and swell  I'll take this under advisement  Thanks   Wish I lived in Montreal Laval  Happy New Years  bro     Another year alone   ForeverAlone  Together   Published a couple papers with a few more in the pipeline    Started going to therapy  stopped self harming    Lost a bit of weight  gained a bit of muscle  started wearing contacts and I think I look significantly better   Only realistic goal I have is to get more fit  I had good progress in 2016 from my skinny ass start but I wanna add 7 10 kg more muscle mass at the very least  If I'm gonna be a disgusting virgin failure I wanna console  myself with at least having a great body  Some people have many different circles  and it's possible that tonight they feel like being in one of the other circles  I operate this way  but have also felt very left out by other people in the past  From experience  I think that maybe if they knew you were going to be alone tonight  they would have invited you  Don't let this ruin your friendship  OP  You have a very good opportunity to grow from a tough situation  and it will dictate how you deal with more situations like this in the future  Good luck  I hope you find your peace  Seek therapy to work through this if it's weighing on your mind  Perhaps someone who is trained in psychoanalysis   I don't much about you but it seems like you've been thru hellish things  Way to go for overcoming them all  You're a fighter and keep winning every battle  But for now  I hope you party first or have some fun  Lol No matter the reasoning for quitting  Personal Support Worker  she does all the dirty work  Even if I was completely stressed because of a co worker   That's a funny thing to see from someone in  r foreveralone  They don't care about you and won't respond back  you'll just seem desperate   so no  Sorry but Happy New Year though  I was about to make a goal of mine for 2017 to "talk to a girl " But then I realized that I wanted to keep my goals realistic for this upcoming year  so I just made none  Oh no  I think I understood the way that you were trying to come across  I genuinely do appreciate your perspective  I think his dad was abusive but committed suicide a while ago  His mother has always been really nice  I think I'm going to find a way to get in contact with her  But probably anonymously  haha  Thanks  If this is something that's bothering you and you feel like you need to process your feelings through  by all means seek out a professional  That's what we're here for  As repulsed as I am by food  I'm starving  I wish I was Amanda Nunes right now and knock someone out  but then I'll probably feel bad and start crying like I want to right now  either tell him the truth  or believe your own lie Anecdotally  I didn't have any trouble with this because I  the girl and therefore the person traditionally expected to have opinions on this subject  was the one who decided I didn't want an engagement ring  All my now husband had to do was stand there  and radiate a general willingness to do whatever I wanted  while I said so  and nobody thought he was doing anything wrong for not buying me a ring because I manifestly didn't want one  So I think your only real option here for stopping people being judgy at you is to delegate all discussions to your girlfriend  if she can confidently claim that this is 100  what she wants and she hasn't been pressured into it  that'll likely solve your problem   and if she  can't   other people's opinions aren't really your problem  y'know   You have some outstanding advice here  FIL is obviously one who likes to be in control and probably is not wanting his daughter to be married  So he's stirring shit up    I'd do this  Have your parents come over for dinner  and then unbeknownst to them  have her invite her parents over  And let them meet   Poison it    I have three kids   9  5  and 3    my 9 year old helps take care of the other two when I am running around crazy  I think you may be over reacting about her and her nefarious intentions  She's a 9 year old girl and it's a penis  I'm sure she's looking at it because she's never seen one    There is nothing wrong with you or your husband asking one of the other children to help     Yay  No problem  Hope all goes well in the end    it doesn't matter when how often but you're not eating enough  i don't know how long you've been doing this but eventually you'll feel pretty sick and tired all the time from not eating enough  Why do you think that  One of these are posted almost weekly now  So what if this place isn't positive  Yeah you seem like you have it figured out  if he's just unenjoyable to be around theres no reason to keep your foot in the fire I can feel you  I fight with the same things   Bpd and Anxiety mostly  Seriously try to have some good time with your family  You may feel a little better  A long distance relationship can be  very stressful but without knowing details I can't help you much   I wish you a happy new year   Happy New Year to you  too  What's incredible is that you're only 20  Good luck in the coming year  Life is what you make of it  in spite of circumstances  And don't worry too much about the number of women you've been with  the girl that matters  won't care  Cheers  man   I'm number 3888  Happy new year   No problem  We had a similar issue in our house when there was a small break in the line and debris was getting into it   Oh yeah  good ol' comment section  Many sites don't have one anymore though  But there's always YouTube lol I've been there  It hurts  A lot  Sometimes I wished  wish   that I'd been raised religious  so that I'd at least have some hope for an afterlife  but I wasn't  so I really don't  That's a hard thing to come to terms with   This might not be useful to you at all  I'm honestly not sure why it was as useful for me as it was  but thinking about  possible  afterlife scenarios somehow mitigated my fears when they were at their worst  Just thinking "okay  but what if   " and expanding on it  world building in my mind  creating reincarnation situations and stuff  Hell  if you're concerned about the universe ending  pick another universe  You don't necessarily have to believe it  or see it as legitimately plausible at all  it's just   weirdly calming  or at least it was for me  I've considered writing a story about my favorite scenario  I think that's how I started thinking about it in the first place  actually  but that's not the point anymore  The point is that I have something to distract myself from despair when things get bad   Good luck  I hope you find something that works for you soon  Thanks  that's really sweet of you to say that  It's posts like these that I really wish outsiders would take notice of  instead of blindly resorting to criticism and name calling  We aren't bad people for getting frustrated sometimes and needing a place to let it all out  At least  I don't think so    Anyway  you're one of my favorite users here so your comment means a lot  You  and most of the guys here  are good people  and I'm sorry that there hasn't been a lady lucky enough to see that  Maybe in another life I could have been that lady for someone here  who knows  I'd "save" all of you if I could  dammit   Here's hoping 2017 brings better things for us  Is your girlfriend a senior as well or is she a junior   This isn't really answering your question but just for her benefit  It might be worth it for her to homeschool  You can get the same quality education if she's motivated and willing to work for it  I can't imagine all the doctors appointments and being sick and carrying a baby in a high school environment  People are cruel    I left public school in 10th grade and got an honors diploma a year later  I now  19 F  have an associates degree  It can be done  If you need advice or assistance PM me    I would really think about this right now since the best time to change is at the end of a semester  I left over Christmas break   assuming you're on a block 4 class schedule   That girl was just an asshole  Fuck her  i'd like that idea  for academic purposes of course Totally normal    Remember  YOU get to define YOUR own definition of what "normal" is for you   For me  normal is not drinking or doing any kind of drugs  Popular belief and our media culture leads us to believe that if you're not drinking or smoking  then you're missing out and not having fun or taking part in what the masses are doing  When  to be quite candid  many people  don't  drink on new years    Many people give a holiday power and use it as a reason to have no limits and just be completely silly and irresponsible  Enjoy your sober night      I'd offer to help but I'd probably make things worse     hearing some success stories  No  thank you Howd you get it            We don't have partners but we have each other  That's something  at least      Thanks  Enjoy yours as well It's true that pot seems more fun than alchool I've always likes super sports  but I prefer not sitting like a frog lol   le nice guy meme  This sub is infected with feminists  Let's hang out There's nothing wrong with only eating once or twice a day  so long as you're getting the caloric intake you need for the day   A banana and some tea definitely does not qualify   this will force your blood sugar to go all wonky  it'll also force your body to try to store and reserve more calories as it's tricked into going to famine mode   Which pretty much defeats the purpose if you're trying to lose weight   Okay    the bottom line  and this is going to sound cliche  you have to listen to YOUR heart    It's YOUR life to live  not your parents  I know it can be challenging to weed out the opinions of others when they seem so strong and make good points or suggestions  but the reality is that you have to pursue and follow what your heart and gut is telling you to    Your family isn't going to be attending university  YOU are  Please do what your initial instinct was and if your family is not happy then that is something they have to work with and come to accept  But to not do what you feel for fear of what others think or say is just denying your needs and desires    Happy new year    i've never been hungover before  what is it like  I'm playing some vidya myself  so I guess I'll have a drink and be there with you in spirit  I'm sorry  SEVERE EAR INFECTION   WAX REMOVAL 2017  The dirty secret is a lot of us don't     I hate to admit it  but I do feel better after a drink  It only takes one for me because I'm small and don't drink often  I get a little light headed  and laugh easier and care less   I only have a drink when I'm feeling particularly shitty and can't escape negative thoughts  like tonight  for instance  It's kind of a last resort because I hate the taste and usually feel a little groggy the next day  I am going to try to be happier with the things I have rather than moping over the things I think I ought to have if I  played my cards right  "sue the shit out of them in small claims court" Sounds good  you in MD  Lol I'm 25 and I've never had a sip of alcohol either  Ultimately it's up to you but my opinion is you shouldn't have to drink alcohol to have fun or to have a social life  You look at them and tell them to grow the fuck up   Then you don't think about them again    Screw pretty assholes   man    ALL WOMEN WANT CHAD  Well I learned something about myself today  too bad being a fat fuck isn't what women want  BUT FAT WOMEN CAN HAVE ATTRACTIVE SKINNY AND RIPPED GUYS INTO THEM  Let me be PERFECTLY CLEAR  you are getting fucked   These are NOT petty issues AT ALL  I'd be shaking mad if I were you   I live in Massachusetts and if you go to full time work to part time work  you can file for unemployment   I'd check on your states rules for this   Look for another job RIGHT AWAY   Keep this one  of course  but start putting together your portfolio now    This is completely unacceptable     DO NOT make the rookie mistake of taking another job on the days that you a scheduled off   They'll schedule you for the days that took the other job and then say 'You worked here first  where are your priorities '   Understand rule  1 about work   It's all about YOU   Your money your growth  your standard of living  PERIOD    This is an opportunity for you  it really is   You will stand up for yourself and that is so impowering  PS Fuck that asshole Jim   I've recently turned off notifications for my messaging app and won't open it until I need it    I know it shouldn't make a difference because no one messaged me anyway but it feels like I'm taking back a small amount of control    No longer messaging people and not getting a reply  No longer checking people's last seen time to decide if they're busy or ignoring me  No longer playing a game I can't win  My time can be better spent    well i'm sure you had boyfriends while in your 20's Getting healthy is a good but you're not going to get laid a gf just because you have abs  I thought that too years ago and it doesn't help at all if you still have social anxiety and don't talk to people much    I'd also temper your expectations as far as getting ripped goes  unless you plan on juicing it's going to take years to get to where you want  We love you and no you don't wow  a lot of doom and gloom on this thread about the impending ruination of your life  i advise you not to trudge into your future carrying this unnecessary burden  the doom  c    yes you're very young to have a baby but you seem fairly resilient  looking to the future rather than bemoaning the past  and resolved to carry on    i was friends with a woman some years ago whose daughter got unexpectedly pregnant in the last year of high school  there was some drama  sure  but the family eventually rallied around   well  except the father  who ghosted    they bought her a condo and helped her pay for day care while she finished her college education  my friend did a lot of babysitting and teaching her daughter how to be a mom  and my friend bitched about it from time to time but here's the deal  everyone in the family loved that baby  and everyone pitched in    difficult timing  but not disastrous in itself   so should you and gf see this through to the child's birth  i advise you to enjoy the hell out of your child's early life  because that time really is gone in a flash    the rest of it  you'll work out       good luck  I'm doing it for myself  I know no one will ever love me even if I was attractive  But running and exercise makes me feel better   Sounds sketchy as fuck   Definitely get a new lock  Honestly I'm just hoping 2017 some things start bouncing my way   I know exactly how you feel  2016 was a huge shitshow for me too  but as people say  once you've hit rock bottom  there's only one way to go    I've been there  exact same situation  I decided to man up   I just thought of something I can do      goggle the names of folks and see who all have died         who I have out lived   I'm pretty damn old so this could take awhile   love your work OP  Good job mate  Okay  No I'm in Bama  let's meet halfway  It's really simple  You know the answer to this  Get out  The world is a beautiful place with many many beautiful people out there  Trust me  I know this  You are the results of your actions  If you choose to remain in the current situation  then you will continue to be unhappy  Just go  Had the same experience not too long ago  I don't know how old you are  but chances are you are around 20  25 ish  Now  the thing that "saved" me was the realization that i had all the time in the world to become another person  The feeling of urgency to achieve something is usually nothing more than that  a feeling  You can't get a great job  a nice family  etc  in an instant    Try to take it slow and do small steps towards your goals  you'll reach them eventually  Everyone has got something they can do like nobody else  so please try and put it to good use    You are not a lover of peace  are you  Oh hhheeyyy   Glad I found you all  This is my third New Years in a row alone  Hanging out with my cats and watching movies and drinking   And tomorrow's my birthday  Here's to the best for all of us in 2017  I just did and it got downvoted    r bestof material right here I've done eight months in the past  Those eight months were pretty good  I lost weight  got a new job  became somewhat social and generally felt confident   Then another rejection made me give up  I don't know if any of the benefits were down to no fap or not but I'm going to try again because my life has become worse than ever    Also I've never combined no fap super powers with my wizard powers  I could  become unstoppable   Got sick of Minecraft already  It sounds like you might have more issues  if having a crush makes you so sick you want to vomit  Have you ever tried going to therapy  Happy early birthday  Let it go   If you can't do this and you're not ready for it  then don't do it  Say no  Your mother is probably worried about your future  and this is her way of trying to make sure that you're provided for  You can provide for yourself  Find a job and save your money  If you're not allowed to work  find a job and say you're going to school  You can take care of yourself  and you can prove it to your mother and yourself  Entering into a marriage or any committed relationship  moving in with someone  before you are self sufficient and know who you are and what you need in a partner is asking for heartbreak and misery  It's your life  Make it what you want it to be  Now is the time  You have your entire life ahead of you  Make it the one you want  It sounds to me like the regular combination of soap  and body filth that accumulates in the bathwater   When you take a shower  it runs down the drain  but when you take a bath  the water sits there  in everything you want to rinse off of yourself   Nearly any cleaning product will clean your tub    3941   I feel special now    How can mirrors be real if our eyes aren't  I'm a bot   bleep    bloop   Someone has linked to this thread from another place

been in relationships like this before they don't always work out just do what makes you happy if she's your friend she'll treat you with respect and care about you good luck is all I can say I hope things work out  That'd be weird   Getting catfished from one of   us   Oh my gosh  This sounds awful  You don't deserve to be treated that way at all  How do you try  Because if you're keeping in touch  you're indulging yourself and your love  Girls can't fuck a personality   Just sayi'n   I can make women laugh up and down the street and do  every day at my work place    It don't make a damn bit of difference  though   still ugly  It's completely up to you to do or not  If you do  however  I recommend starting light with your consumption  just try a beer or two  and avoid hard liquor on your first go  Should help you from getting super drunk  unless you can't hold your alcohol very well   Of course there's always the possibility you may just not like how alcohol tastes and will choose to avoid it anyway  like me  I'll be home alone with my cat  I have a little wine left and a lot of snacks so it should be OK    Maybe I'll get Uncharted 4  Good distraction  keep it p and make sure she comes first  and frequently  you won't regret it  Sounds like there's more going on here than simple unwillingness to eat   That said  buy Fuji apples   They're hard and crisp   I have yet to find a soft spot in one unless it's really old   Try slices with peanut butter    the 100 percent that you have to stir  not the Jif shit   Every five year old I ever tried that on gobbled it down  and nobody's pickier about their food than five year olds  I cleaned the tub a week ago  and was out of town all week  with comet powder  a scrub brush  and lots of elbow grease  I only take showers    I took my first foot bath today and I could see gunk floating on the top of the water  I wish I was old enough to get drunk so it would be easier to end it all Congrats my man  it'll only get easier from here on out  Make a good change this coming new years OP  Leave him and start fresh this year  HERE'S TO 2017   pours you a shot of whiskey     Counselling worked for me also  but you have to find the right one for you  I needed four tries  Best of luck to you    Nothing new to me another year gone by  plus my birthday is in less than 2 3 days  What better way than to spend your big two zero than home  secluded same as all my other birthdays   You are overthinking this  You like him and it sounds like he is comfortable enough to open up about personal issues and enjoys hanging out with you  Guys are not as complex as you probably think    If I were you  I would just look for more opportunities to hang out with him outside of class or school related activities  Maybe go see a movie or go out for a drink somewhere  Sounds to me  according to the framework provided  that youre doing activities for the sake of becoming social  instead of doing something you enjoy that involves other people  Idk  maybe find something that only has one or two other ppl instead of a large group  We're not experts here  try a variety of approaches   TLDR  Sounds like you should try more things you enjoy  i'm sure its much more common than you think  most likely happens to guys more than girls because girls don't have to be the initiators At least you get invited lol Sounds to me like youre problem lies more in staying in the coversation  You should practice asking questions  When ppl seem like theyre ignoring you  try interjecting with questions that actually steer the conversation  I agree with egobot  I needed four  Which state and city  Agree with  u JuliaH7931  Best to explore these issues with a qualified therapist   The idea of repressed memories of childhood abuse has been pretty much discredited IIRC  The "recovered memories" in many cases turned out to be fabrications  Are you referring to cod liver oil  Or fish oil  the latter I believe has minimal amounts of vit D  Sorry to hear that happened  But kudos  on you for asking him out  Rejection sucks but it's better than never asking in the first place   I changed my brothers diaper when I was 6  I wanted to help my mom out since she was napping   Thank you for the kind words  Its the fact that I don't have someone waiting for me when I get back more than the letters  The correction  and telling them to re read is fine  but just drop telling ppl how they will feel  Have a suggestion for the interrogation phase   2 second pause after hearing each question  breathe out  then answer quietly but clearly  void of emotional challenge  I hope  Thats one of the reasons I joined as I heard Marines are a big brotherhood  I was dumped three days before my picnic on the new years eve  I'm sorry  but you're an asshole     Here lately  when I dont feel it comes from a genuine place I just say 'Thank You " Im from the bible belt  so ppl are very much into the mindset of "Its christmas  so Im supposed to be happy and say these phrases to as many ppl as possible " Im a host at a restaurant so ppl tell me happy new yrs a lot  I just thank them for it  Any reasoning behind your preference    To my knowledge  coconut oil does not contain any essential fatty acids   Essential meaning your body cannot synthesize any   If it's an improvement  does it matter whether you're moving toward or away from "normal"  My mom wanted me to watch FOX with her to wait for the ball to drop  I made it about 10 minutes before seeing all the couples and happy  sexy people being interviewed before I had to get the fuck out of there  I'm currently locked in my room crying and drinking the night away  Happy new years  Definitely  Some isolation is normal and fine  Happens all the time when you graduate and start guiding your own life  But you make new friends and such typically  Seems like this was happening to you and you also had the shit luck of ending up in this relationship     I have pretty low standards but it doesn't really matter because im never going to get into a situation where it matters lol Ahhh  to be young and in love and in Berlin   Edit  in Damn  I feel so bad for you  This sounds like a shitty situation to be in  How long have you known the friend that invited you  How long have you been at the wedding dinner already  My goal  really my number one  critical goal for 2017  is to walk into a psychiatrist's office  and be bluntly honest    I have kinda that foreboding feeling  that this is my last opportunity to proceed in a non disruptive way    I must act  or this problem will do it for me in a not so nice way   You mean your fuck buddy  Annapolis  MD And this is why you're FA I have a very beautiful cubic zirconia ring that was not expensive at all  You could not tell the difference  Also  watch the Adam Ruins Everything on the topic  It's great  https   www amazon com Star brite Hull Cleaner Spray dp B00Z9N4WC0 ref sr 1 3 ie UTF8 qid 1483240847 sr 8 3

goes alright for you If not  you will have our support  There was an acne thread yesterday with a few mentions of bad teeth as well  Mine are yellowish because there are tons of fluoride in water and many people who grew up in this town have shit teeth because of that  People think I don't brush  I brush circles around you fools  It doesn't matter  My dentist says it won't whiten  and I ain't got no munny for more sophisticated stuff  Agreed  This is the simplest approach with OPs fiancee doing the driving in this manner  It reduces the chance of getting caught in the crossfire between her and her folks  I wouldn't doubt that FIL can push some buttons but the fiancee knows what to expect whereas OP doesn't   Sadly  the smallest I've been in my adult life is 16 18  Even though I worked out  dieted  would even starve myself  I could not drop my size to anything below that  Hence why I'm working with my doctor and keeping tabs on potential PCOS  Because if that is an issue  then there's going to be a world of trouble with dropping the rest of it  At least I can build muscle       It's possible for women to be forever alone  I wish people understood that  Just because we look nice doesn't mean we have guys flocking to us  I'm kind of frightening apparently and I have social anxiety  so not really approached  Plus  can't seem to find most guys I meet attractive  Not asexual  but still have this issue  Plus  y'know  mental illness is a thing   It's a hit or miss  Mostly miss  TLDR of every ex fa success story is they were late bloomers who did normie stuff and it worked out for them or they got lucky and girlfriended married the first woman who showed interest in them  I don't know what advise to give  but here's an internet hug  sorry for bad wrigting  I will thanks  Well they're my favorite football team and gives me joy  The rings are about her and for her  so she gets to decide what happens   ayooo     but in seriousness  toys or just go out and get some  Don't be afraid of your sexuality  Just be safe about it Nice shaming  That's interesting  I was under the impression that repressed memories were entirely legitimate   I hope OP figures out what he feels like is an issue    complains about feminism    complains about being shamed   Hmm     I feel ya  Good luck out there  though  Maybe you'll make a bunch of normie friends at Basic and end up busting out of FA after all  The man's trying to make some change in his life  Let him be  I'm really happy for you  I really hope you have a great year Sorry you are having a bad time  Can you leave each day to go do things  Any relatives to visit  perhaps she would not mind if your doing family related things  Are your local library open Monday  Perhaps you could get your brother to go with and get her to chill out on him not studying  Does he at least have someplace warm to stay tonight  That's basically my plan  yes  Thanks  I'll check it out  Property management tends to lag to the point where minor fixes are just worth solving for myself   Thanks again  That much chocolate won't hurt your dog  To my knowledge it takes an ounce per pound the dog weighs to kill it  Yeah  fucking with someone else's feelings and expectations  Idk  Sometimes you really have to think about yourself  but this is really bad  I bet his lover is feeling even worst   It is not bad at all  There is a saying that the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step  You are at least taking small steps to improve  thats at least better than doing nothing  So what are your resolutions  Mine is to drink more water  Thats step 1 for me in my journey to lose weight and be more healthy  Lol  Good  Please go on    all I can ever manufacture to say is something very generic   "the beer is nice"  "it's so loud in here"  "how's your night going " etc   That's actually perfectly fine  I say stuff like that and people say stuff like that all the time as well  The problem is  you  think it's a problem and get self conscious about it    The way out of this is to realize that  if you do indeed say something stupid or others think you're too boring or whatever  you have to  own  it  If you are comfortable with it  then what others think won't bother you  That will help you overcome your worry and self consciousness  Ironically  you'll then speak alot more effortlessly and come across as less socially awkward  So the saying "it's all in your head" is actually true  I got mine out due to constantly getting sore throats every year  I had what they called kissing tonsils  They were so big that they touched each other at all times  I haven't had a traditional sore throat in 20 years  Just the occasional mild sore throat from sinus draining  I love drinking orange juice when this occurs  Which side is the crazy side  Haha  I thought you meant mlb giants   Everybody's body responds differently too  I've never been much of a drinker and only ever really had a couple of social drinks  It was never something I particularly liked or enjoyed so didn't actively seek it  I used to prefer vodka because it was easy to disguise but always had a few side effects even from just a couple of light drinks  Later on I realised that I had an intolerance to potatoes so I was giving myself a double dose    I also have something of a histamine intolerance now so my body cant handle it anymore  What you might be feeling could be something like that  As much as it has a socially acceptable image  it isn't what you would call healthy and we are all built differently  Thank you   I will be take a vacation from Tumblr  Instagram and parts of Reddit  gotta keep tabs on some subs for health reasons  There are some issues there and none of us really want that at all  How am I supposed to know what's normal  I'm alone on new years eve  haven't had a girlfriend in a year and am way too old to be getting into fights on the internet  I hope that what you're experiencing ends and you become happy in every situation  Have a happy new year    Should I confront him physically   No  Can you point out the inaccuracies in this account please  Where is she wrong in this instance   I've gone to all of my friends weddings alone   It sucks but the best you can do is smile and be happy for them on their night  Yeah I'm from NY  I'm sorry that happened to you  But everyone has a breaking point  and once past that decisions aren't really as thought out when compared to the result from those decisions     Dumping someone compared to focusing on myself so I can start getting my life together     Of course it's shitty and could be done in a better way but people are different than you in every sense  Don't even worry about that douche  do just you   To you   but the science is still out on effects of gmo crops in their respective  localities  I agree that eating gmo crops is safe    Do you need someone to talk to   I'm sorry  do you want to talk about it  Then I suggest waiting  Don't make any decisions until you are sure  If you are never sure  then so be it   I'm pretty sure you can ask to have a photo of you taken off facebook  Check their policies I'm going through a similar thing  I recently realized I tend to be too pushy  persistent  and sometimes aggressive when pursuing friends or romance  Honestly  no one is perfect at communicating  We're all just pushing our sausage fingers into a glowy thing in the hope that someone else is listening    There are other people that have posted actual tips on this thread  I am not one of them   Damn  I saw this too late  Would have gone with you but I literally got off work at 8 Any other ideas   I understand how you feel  but maybe try baking apple slices with a bit of cinnamon on them  Should be very bearable and tasty at that point  If it doesn't work out  let me know  I'll come up with a few things   That's not halfway  Good luck and have lots of fun  Thanks so much  I promise I'm not knocking him at all and I apologize if it seemed like I was  I am on that road also  Only thing I am getting clear is that I am a sensitive person and have to focus on people   I am bisexual   that is sensitive and considered  don't waste a second with people that is harsh  dumb  or a combination of that  and favor humanity over beauty  If it's any consolation  staying home  watching TV  and drinking is basically my plan too  What are you looking for  You say you don't want to be the type to seek revenge or hold onto a grudge  that you don't want to let a thug like him have an impact on your life  It sounds to me like you already know what the best course of action is  Well  I regret nothing  I had them out when I was 31  ish   because I was sick of dealing with tonsil stones every day  I used to have what I thought were terrible allergies  runny nose  stuffy sinuses  sore throats  etc  but that cleared up after the tonsils and adenoids came out    I'm all for science and stuff but I'm sure glad I did it   thank you People absolutely do respond to physical appearance   To a depressing degree   There is actual research on this   As a woman  it's striking how differently  better  people treat me when I do the full makeup  skirt  jewelry  etc thing and better fit the mold of what our society considers attractive   So of course I do that when I want that advantage   BUT  it makes me respect those people less  for being such superficial dumbasses   Sometimes I wonder how different my life would be if I worked harder to be "hot" or whatever   I'd have more people in my life but probably not quality people  Idk  It's been like four days and I cannot stop thinking about it  He used to make lots of plans for us and now he just removed me from Facebook  I did nothing before or after that   I'm really sad    I would drive to his home and wait till tomorrow to see him  or to his work  But he's not like me  He hates this kind of things  these romcom scenes  I'm a hopeless romantic crying for him at the new years eve and for him there's no coming back   It's good that you now know where it all began  The feeling you get when things finally begins to take shape is amazing isn't it  I'm glad for being able to help  Frankly speaking  my new year has so much more meaning because of this comment dialogue  Thank you for sharing with me    And now that you have started to put things together  you should get your self esteem back  Finish this process that you have started  You will feel in charge of your life in no time  Now  it won't be all glossy and shiny  It might be  You might get an adrenaline rush  It's amazing when that happens  I love adrenaline  But remember to not be afraid and start questioning everything once the adrenaline wears off  And feel free to talk to me anytime you want to  If no one else  just talk to yourself  That's the one person you can always count on being there for you    A very happy new year to you darling    Thanks  Ill update in 13 weeks  The problem a bad relationship can cause you is NOT just emotional  but financial and legal   Many divorced men become destitute or homeless when divorce court imposes impossible alimony and child support  Some men are falsely accused of rape and spend years in prison  It can be much much worse than being alone  That was the reason I chose FA decades ago   In my book if you dident do this your pretty much a lame God I wish I could make this THE post of the year  I've been in this exact situation before and it hurts more than anything feeling so alone while surrounded by a shit ton of people  No one cares who you are  you're just invisible to them  And the best part  When you try to explain to normies they refuse to understand  My plans with friends fell through  Girl drama is the worst  Most likely going to cry myself to sleep tonight   In NYC  Absolutely    NYC is where you go when you don't want to stop the party  Being from NY  I know a few people that have that exact plan  You leave before it burns you out though  It's really down to what OP feels  but I wouldn't do more than 5    An idea is not worth shit  Ideas are dime a dozen  It is implementation and execution that matter    really nice  What an understatement Good luck not getting her pregnant  I am assuming you have some hobby relaxing activity that can at least even out some of the tension  right  Having an outlet is important  She's a junior and has been considering home school before any of this happened  I'll discuss this with her as well  Thank you so much for reaching out   Hey  The liberty of having Internet friends is you can be anyone you want to be  Who cares what they think  Be who you want and do what you want  No need to be embarrassed   Everyone does their own humming and dumb stuff too  Yes  it all worked fine i tottaly got over most of it  am almost thankfull that it happened  i forgave myself some time ago but i can't seem to forgive him in any way  and thats still affecting me for sure  I feel like smashing his face in when i think about it Better than celebrating a year full of disapointment  at least for me  No matter the reason  You should have went to your boss or HR Ilife there was problems    Congratulations  you are transgender  PM me or go to r asktransgender if you have any questions  Use the code UJ2D74 for your complementary pickle jar  Edit  that may have come across as insensitive  But seriously I would see a gender therapist  It's an illusion  I swear  I only seem like I have a plan  I'm winging it  But I'm trying to get it done   1  I'm too scared to kill myself  2  I don't want to put my parents through that kind of pain   3  I have a tiny smidge of hope that things will get better and it's enough to keep me around   4  Distractions  I distract myself with everything that I do  be it work  uni  movies etc just so I think about it less    If it's any consolation  you have a whole  fresh  clean new year to explore and find something even better  Dude    the cops won't use your name  I call the cops for stuff all the time  I see a drunk driver  I call  I see road racers I call  It's just so they have a name  Trust me  They won't document you and make a file on your ass  Well  I'm not eating an ice cream cone  so your New Year's Eve is already way better than mine  It seems that you think that something is "wrong" with spending your time alone  Why is that  Why would spending time with yourself be worse than being all alone in a loud  obnoxious environment  If anything  I think it's sad that someone would have to DEPEND on other people for their own entertainment  It means you can't even enjoy yourself   And also tell me  what are you "getting from the night" apart from bleeding eardrums and horrible alcoholic breath  Horror movies don't scare me  unfortunately  Not many positive things have happened to me  One thing I can think of is that I got my first sales on my Etsy store in 3 years  https   www etsy com uk shop KokoroCards   I also went to Paris in the summer for one night  all I could afford   My first time overseas  Yeh yeh she ain't a perv at her age  She just wants to help her little brother and it's we ridden cause he's got a weird thingy and she don't   Fucking white knight  Good job  But don't worry    20 is young as hell  you have so much time it's not even funny I know she's not your kid so you don't really grasp it  but that's her kid brother    Seek professional help please  Not us reddit professionals  It's not an issue because everybody is consenting  everybody is safe and everybody knows what they're doing  Assuming that they're doing it properly  of course   I would never in a million years lay a finger on my boyfriend  but I sometimes have days where I'm a switch and I'm feeling dominant  For me  it's a very maternal feeling and the punishment feels playful for the both of us  On the flip side  it's the exact same case    and  quit saying "can't function move" as if that's some catch all term for disgustingly messed up  abusive acts  I don't know if you're intentionally generalizing but there's a huge  huge difference between abuse taking it too far  and being "unable to function" because your ass is too sore  or because you've had a particularly intense session that'll take a day or two to recuperate from   Also  very seldom does masochism have anything to do with straight up beating  it's often whipping smacking  pinching pulling and awkward positions  that are being slowly worked up towards  A dom doesn't just drag his sub by the hair into their bedroom  beat the living daylights out of her and then fuck her  A good dom knows how to do the BDSMM equivalent of foreplay and will bend over backwards to make sure that their sub is okay   I get that you're focusing less on BDSM and more on fetishes as a whole  but that's still pretty off  So what if a fetish or kink will occasionally affect you outside of hot n' heavy times  It's not like normal sex can't do that  It's pretty standard for people to leave sex "glowing"  unable to sit down or generally hot and bothered  I don't see the issue  I guess  Thanks  Lol  Learn to drive one handed yo  Already back at home    Already back home Me too  Not at this exact moment  but yesterday  a few days before that  every day for two weeks awhile ago    It comes and goes  I just told someone they had their whole life ahead of them to make what they wanted of it  And I realized that's still true for me too  It doesn't matter if you're 19  30  60  or 85  You still have the rest of your life  Everyone's situation is different  But your life is yours  If you're not satisfied with the results of your decisions  try making a different one than normal tomorrow  See how it goes  I've made some different ones  Some help  some don't  Pay attention  Keep what works    I agree  I called the non emergency number and they said they'll get someone out when they can  That was over 3 hours ago  And they're still setting off some serious stuff that is rattling my windows  So they either didn't show up  or the dbags around here ignored them  Ironically  the Sheriff's office just enacted special enforcement of burning and other things like that due to the severe lack of rain over the last couple months  im in Florida  If you can't argue with him without getting hit  your father is an abuser   You literally can't stand up for yourself as an adult without getting beaten   That's pure wrong     I'm not saying you're a saint  but your father is out of control   He may be "honorable " but he's damaged and is doing his best to pass the damage on  as abused people  and he was one  usually do   He probably convinced himself he's "being a man '  But it is wrong for him to hit you simply for disagreeing   There is no excuse   It is wrong   Frankly I don't have good advice    You can keep taking it  you can avoid him  stay away as much as possible  you can tell your teachers  who are bound by law to tell the cops and then who knows what will happen   But I don't know  maybe a foster home is better than this shit    Hopefully  I will too  I mean  I love this particular woman more than life  but she doesn't want me anymore  So what's the point of being alive without love  And I doubt I will ever find love like her's again  I haven't loved anyone like that   ever  I was even married for 14 years  until she cheated on me   I can't get interested in another woman enough to even find out  I have no children and will end up old  alone   in a nursing home  more than likely   So  I'm ready to go  I tried to get God to take me a few times this year  but nothing  I don't believe in suicide  because it's murder  So it has to come without any intervention on my part  I'm ready to go to Heaven    And rhytard   don't wish to die unless you have something or someone worth dying for  It's just a waste       a anyone who doesn't agree with my blue pill beliefs

they said  It'll be fine they said  Just because there's no correlation in this study doesn't mean it doesn't help a subset of people  My fiance had hers out at age 30 and it has made all the difference  Before she was sick with URIs 3 4 times a year  It's been over two years and she has had one bad cold since  The ENT doc said her tonsils had more crevasses in them than normal which harbored a bunch of viruses bacteria  Long story just to say things aren't always cut and dry   I had to go to my sister's wedding alone and i had to be in it  After the ceremony  as the bride  groom  bridesmaid  groomsmen  and immediate family walked up the aisle  i had to walk out of that front row with eyes all on my up the aisle all by myself  Felt like one of the worst moments of my life    It probably won't change much of the advice but i now realise i left this to interpretation  I didn't get into that fight the guy dragged me from a bar and instantly punch me You play the hand that life dealt you   If romance is not in the cards  so be it   There are other challenges in life  like   be the best in your field  be successful in a business and make a ton of money  walk the Pacific Crest

Violence hotline   www thehotline org  They also support people who are in emotionally abusive relationships    Also  if any of the people you drifted away from are more your friends than his  consider trying to get back in touch and explain what's been going on and that you need help leaving him  Sometimes it's surprising who will step up and help when it's needed    This will tell you  https   www reddit com r ForeverAlone comments 5ldjdn im finally doing it update   Ah  a woman's instinct is strong indeed  but you need strong evidence in case she ever tries to act on her feelings  I think you should just try and separate your bf and your bff from each other  Do you think your bff would act on her feelings  Future reference  do a tldr   I read about 90  of it  Let me try to help a bit and make things as clear as I can  I  also  am 25   also have a sister who is 19  close to 20 so u and I can kind of relate    My sister doesn't live with me  I won't let her move in for this reason  I am not her mother and I refuse to tell her what to do    You're mothering your sister  Knock it off  Your sister is 20  she will grow up on her own time line and she will do what she pleases when she wants to  If she pays her portion of the bills then leave it at that  You could ASK her to help with doing things but her bedroom that she pays for is none of your business and her laundry problem isn't your problem to worry about either   If you've already established that she isn't coming with u and your kid and husband then let things be until the move and tell her ahead of time so she can make arrangements   Thank you for the idea  I'll try that    it means a lot  Oooh that actually sounds really good  Thank you  it really helps  you seem so kind and patient  All you can do then is file a complaint at the station  File one about the neighbors and file another about the seemingly long or no response  Nothing will likely happen  but it will be on record at least  That way they have a pattern for next time  Presumably July  I mean  you're right   Guess I was just looking for opinions people maybe in similar situations or with similar feelings   Not necessarily seeking "help"    Yep exactly what I've noticed  Also because serial monogamy for a lot of us just feels better  I notice a lot of semi break ups    Like  you never moved in with the person  but you two just "fade out" and go your own ways after a month or two of dating  as you move on to others    Then sometimes you may get back with someone else again from before  who knows  The alternative is sex with lots of strangers  Sure it sounds great in the fantasy of porn  but in reality    I'm not so sure  I tried it a couple of times  I remember hooking up with a girl and for all intents and purposes it was supposed to be a one time only thing since she lived in another country  But of course  we felt super awkward afterwards given those conditions in effect  In fact realizing what she was doing  she felt ashamed and wouldn't talk to me  So instead we ended up becoming friends on Facebook and talking frequently  This was now like 6 years ago and we still chat sometimes  we have similar tastes in music   So yeah even one attempt at anonymous hooking up didn't work for me   If you have any interest in hanging out with the classmate who texts you  you could try texting her back and say something like "That sounds like fun  I should totally go with you guys next time " Or you could try texting someone else if you have their contact info  It doesn't always work  but sometimes it does    I have read from so called 'Ex FA's' were just people that never really been FA or just were at the right place right time    That's not true  I did a lot self improvement and worked really hard to mean new people  normie I can see you've put alot of effort in this post and have great ideas  but I don't think this is the best way of following them  I know that we have FA meetups here every now and then  or do we  I don't remember  but wearing something like a badge singles us out even more   Another big problem with this is that even if I identified another FA  what would make me want to talk to them  I know some people like me are deathly afraid of talking to strangers and have panic attacks just thinking about it  Hell I can barely keep up conversations with normal people there's no way I can go chat up with someone else  even if they are FA  To be honest the thought makes me very uncomfortable   Either way  I think there should be an easier way to interact with other FAs in real life  but I can't really think of one  Happy New Years to you too     Move on and grow up  Can you tell us more about your background  What's your life like  Might help us with our answers  Also  happy New Year      You do realize you're literally acting like the stereotypical neckbeard and "nice guy"  right  If this is who you truly are  then this is the reason you're FA  plain and simple  This is something the both of you need to discuss and agree upon  My fiance and I don't believe in marriage   Ironic because he is my fiance  lol    We are engaged but the whole engaged to be married thing   not us  My ring was a  200 walmart ring I chose  I lost it  neither of us were too upset and now I found rings we both like for  30 a piece online  It's not about being engaged  it's about feeling connected to one another when we aren't together  Kind of a commitment  loyalty  connection ring  Idk how to explain it  I'm not a traditional woman by any means so I see where you're coming from    Also  if it's just a ring she wants   don't go blowing 10 fucking k on it  Lol  Spend 10k elsewhere dude  That's absurd  I pretty much just had a smoke and some snacks  then went to sleep  Of course  until I got woken up by next door and ended up watching science fiction shows  Some good shit on TV right now  shame everyone else is missing it   To be fair  I was going to go out  but then I found out nobody else is going and I just got back from visiting family in Austria  so I've got some pretty bad Jetlag  and I'm still disappointed from going back to gross British coffee    My best friend is coming over tomorrow anyway  the only reason we're not dreading the new year together is because they're having their weekly horrific migraine  Their new year is probably much  much worse  Prehistoric times   "You  me  sex "  https   www youtube com watch v myvaeC f95o  Move on  Well  are you okay with him sleeping with other women  Can you love him even if he isn't monogamous  because he doesn't seem to be living that lifestyle   happy new year guys  Both my sisters out with their husbands    I really wish I had a girlfriend  This sucks  but gl next year  Looks is what gets people interested in the first place  you fall in love with someone's personality after you fall in love with someone's look  There's no fix to this  it's purely biological  And it sucks  Still two FA guys in that clip  It seems wrong to use people like that  Congrats   Happy new year   I am not okay with it  I'm not sure I'm capable of being in an open relationship   You started some shit with a guy  he beat you up  You used it for motivation   Now you want to go back and stir up more shit   You haven't been in a fight since  That's a good thing  If you've stopped threatening people then that guy did you a favor  Hey man I'm in the same boat  Wanna grab a drink   There was once a time when men pretty much bought their wives off of their families  but you still had to have money and the relationships probably weren't  particularly  healthy   You'd probably be finding books more along the lines of "How to murder your husband and run away with the hot neighbor guy"  Ok I will try to talk more and make some thing happen  Thanks for the reply   I have tried the cold approach many times  it didn't work  Never  ever  be someone's second choice  We're you wrong for going through his phone  Technically yes  but he's cheating on you which is a lot worse   You need to confront him about it  Sure he makes you happy and makes you laugh  but if he's not fully invested in your relationship  you need to leave him  You're not alone in this  You sound like my fiance and I sound like yours  Literally  to a T  We've both been at our wits end and thought that the relationship just wasn't worth sacrificing our time or energy for anymore but we're working on it and decided that the way we actually feel towards one another is more important to work on versus walking away and starting all over again with someone new    What it comes down to is whether you truly love this woman or if you're trying to convince yourself that you truly love her  There's a huge difference between love and lust  in which I am sure you know now  Love isn't easy man  Not by any means  You have to work on it  work for it and want it more than anything    Show her more affection  Seriously  Do it  It'll make a world of difference  Dedicate time to her  without technology  Turn off both of your phones  take her to the park on a starry warm evening and have a late night dinner at 2 am  Plan dates she has no idea about  Do something  It sounds like the spark has been lost between the 2 of you  This is the issue between my fiance and I   Matter of fact  I packed all of my clothes and my son's clothes last night because I was just done with it all  Within 24 hours my fiance has made me fall in love with him all over again  How  Small changes  He use to not kiss me and show me he wanted me before I left for work  Today however   he let me sleep in as late as I needed before I had to get ready for work  when I was getting ready he'd grab my butt and call me sexy and actually flirt with me  He tried to put me in a good mood and the way he kissed me    he hasn't kissed me like this for years    Small changes make BIG differences  You do need to share with her how you feel though  And she needs to tell you how she feels as well because I can promise she has some emotions she's holding back   Just report it  Select the "other" option  and state why you are reporting it  We tend to check out anything that gets reported  and especially anything that gets several reports  We don't care if you put "he sounds like a dick" in the report reason  we will check it out anyways and remove if necessary  From what I have read  typical antidepressants  SSRIs  plus Wellbutrin  do not affect intelligence   But prolonged use of anti anxiety meds like benzos  Ativan xanax etc  are proven to cause long term brain damage and impaired cognitive functioning   Google for the details  and decide if it is worth it for you  Ive tried being "more confident bro"  ive "hit the gym brah"  ive "shaved brah"  ive "grown a beard brah" etc etc and swarms of women have not come to me yet    happy nye to you too dude  You sound like a good bloke  hopefully 2017 is a better year for all of us  It has nothing to do with looks  Nope  nope    Daily reminder plenty of misogynists get mad pussy   Broke my heart while reading this  but it's so true   But where will he go  He's supposed to stay here until March  I'll feel bad for just throwing him out on the street  You're most welcome  Happy new year to you both    Even if someone oozed confidence but was still lacking in the looks department he would be constantly rejected left and right   Can confirm  this is pretty much a description of my life  Contact the Department of Health and Human Services for your state  Resources will be listed on the website  There may be involuntary hospitalization options  though that can be difficult  Adult protective services may also be an option    You may need to realize that you can't control another adult or help her if she doesn't want help  You may need to keep your distance or limit your time with her to protect yourself    I just decided to do what I knew wouldn't lead to me being upset or angry and drank by myself at home  I can't even go outside anymore without wanting to throttle someone  You are you  That is enough  It really is  https   i ytimg com vi yjk7SgxNCjQ maxresdefault jpg if you get the reference It does help but only temporarily though  because once you are back to sobriety it all goes back to shit Is it    Is it   It can help a little every now and then for some people  but for a lot of people it can actually made depression worse  Drinking alone or regularly is far more likely to make it worse  I had completely resigned to never meeting anyone to spend my life with  I found someone that I hit it off this October  And while it didn't work out for various reasons  it made me realize that these things pop up at the weirdest moments  In my opinion  probably the best thing about 2016 is that it's over now  I threatened him after the fight  i didn't start it up he grabbed me from a beer line and instantly punched me didn't even see him  I become somewhat illiterate apparently when i talk about this subject still  It's hard for me to express it exactly cause of all the things i told myseld thru the years  this should explain the situation a bit It's because most lack the social skills   I think a lot of people would be surprised at how easily you can intimidate a dog  Growing up I would walk my dog all the time and we would often encounter aggressive dogs roaming around on their own  One of these dogs came running up to mine and was acting like he was going to bite my dog's neck  Both dogs were very large  but I stood up tall and yelled at the dog  He backed off a tiny bit and I stared him down while I pulled my dog further away from the aggressive one  Be confident  be scary  don't show the dogs any signs that you are afraid    Also  another piece of advice  When I am walking my dogs and I notice a dog in the distance I pretend I don't see it  More than half of the time if I don't pay attention to it  neither will my dogs and when the other dog doesn't get any reaction out of the others it will usually go on its way  Your dogs rely a lot on the way you are feeling  If you're nervous they're going to be too  but if you feel relaxed and comfortable they will also    Maybe get some distance if you're finding it hard   Yes that's exactly his problem  Couldn't resist   I agree with your advice  Sorry  it's just very difficult to be taken seriously when you have mental disorders and not a physical disability  let alone 'anxiety' which as a word is so overused the severe sufferers can never be taken seriously  I just don't think this is the place to dismiss anxiety disorders though as many FA have genuine social anxiety disorder diagnosed by a professional and such which really affects their lives  Thanks for the kind words and you too  I did have another submission on this subreddit  One thing that I've learned about all the experiences I had was instead of being bitter  I've learned to become more compassionate about others  We all have different battles and we need to be more understanding about others  Don't let the evilness of the world blind you to see that there's still goodness left and the world is still beautiful to live in  When the world is unkind  be kind enough  I did have a blast last night  To drive off the negativities and evil  as a cultural tradition   I had a casserole and a spoon to create noise as noisy as possible last midnight  hahahaha   Alcohol helped me by being more social  Which girls like  But I like weed more  Just more healthier   You should come clean to her  Explain it to her exactly like it is on this thread  If she reacts negatively then it confirms your suspicions  if not then she may be unintentionally acting this way  or getting carried away trying to feel like she has a big friend circle  Honesty is always the best policy in these kinds of situations  I've found     shower obsession  Still haven't gotten old for me  HNY  7 AM here  very quiet  Maybe take up a form of meditation and above all  let yourself be happy  Let everything that bothers you go  Don't let logic get in the way just breathe and let yourself be happy  You're using chrome  reset your passwords  and you won't have to worry  All you need is a few seconds  I think you're overreacting  they probably thought it was funny Anxiety  I have it  I take medication for it  It sucks   well i'm pleased this wasn't a tale of suicide Clearly you were doing it wrong brah  Can you go into details please  Where  What did you say  Them  Etc  I'm extremely interested in this  Fairest thing  Tell him exactly what you said here  If he's been patient with you so far  he might be willing to wait it out   I say wait it out because there's no better time to bring it up with your therapist  That's what they're there for  to talk about problems    tried it  it "worked" if the goal is to speak with some random stranger for 10 minutes  however  if the goal is to form any kind of lasting  meaningful connection then it failed miserably It breaks my heart that I'm still single and people are getting treated poorly in other relationships  Like  no one asks to get cheated on   As for kicking him out  honestly  I would because he lied on three different occasions  but realistically that won't sit well with anyone   Just talk to him and say that you want to break things off with him because he's obviously not committed to your relationship  For safety concerns  I'd have a friend with you when you confront him  Just FYI  AAA and a lot of local groups taxi services will do free rides on NYE and other holidays   so people don't have to drive drunk or pay crazy uber surge prices  So you can keep that in mind for next time  Just alone in my room empty place I live in I wish I had someone with me but I don't just listening to music the only thing that brings me joy in the world  Can confrim  used to work for AAA  They'll tow your car and take you home  Why  What happened  What is the reason  Is your cousin a bitch  Kind of seems like it I can relate  Happy New Year  o ok brah ill try doing it right next time brah Yeah I feel like I'm wasting the time half the time it's not response  Uhm yeah  leave  Get the f out of that relationship now  You're only hurting yourself  Once a cheater  usually always a cheater  This is the THIRD time and you're asking for advice  Girl  know your worth  congrats  my mom is the only one who has called me so far  technically it's not 2017 for another 45 minutes in my time zone  so i'm gonna wait by the phone for additional calls  This sounds like great advice  I'll try it  Thanks very much  Rich and powerful  charismatic  and he didn't look like a potato  I have none of these things going for me  Yes  He is not protected by rule 2 since rule 2 is for FA'ers only   Alright man  Happy new years  Happy New Years  I'm a total nerd  I don't care  I'll be a fracking nerd if I want  Maybe a more practical first step would be putting your city in your flair  Thank you very much  haha No its just her friend is only 18 and still with her parents so it was the parents rule that they could celebrate but no driving or guys over   all I get is being ghosted  guys over 60  or guys 10 states over   Not sure if this is actually what the gay community is like in general  or I just relate so closely that I don't know anything else  Thank you  You mean more scary  I mean this  dude understandably is kinda in shock but his post is making think me think he doesn't quite get it  He seems to think he is still going to carry on and do as he planned  That it's totally cool that he's gonna rely on mommy and daddy  I feel bad for him because he's kinda fucked unless he makes some difficult sacrifices and works his ass off   Midnight hit and the fireworks went off  I stupidly turned on the TV and saw the couples kissing which hit me in the feels  Everyone is having fun out there and I'm here alone pathetically sobbing  This is hitting me directly in the feels   Good for you man  Way to start the new year off right   I tried the whole bar club scene and that didn't work  I have tried the cold approach in stores   I would tried to talk with girls   Most of the time they were not interested   A few times when it did go well they already had a boyfriend or I wasn't able to take things further  Thanks  You seem nice as well  I doubt 2017 will be better for any of us but maybe we will get lucky  It's doubtful considering our past  so I'm just hoping a few of us make it out   I see other people sitting alone in coffee shops and whatnot  Sometimes I wonder  maybe I should just walk up to them and ask if I can join them  There's probably about X   of people that would be extremely happy to have somebody to talk to  and Y   of people that would wonder why tf is this creep talking to me     What do you think the X and Y values are    At least if you're a gay guy you can still get laid whenever you want  I mean  if it's going to be with that 60 year old dude in the corner with genital warts then sure     Haha  thanks  Yeah  it's 12 25 am here in The Eastern US  You too  I don't think I'd be interested in advertising this in public  I think you're suggesting that it wouldn't be common knowledge  but we're not a secret society  people would find out   I'm also not too inclined to try to befriend someone  just  because they're lonely  There are a handful of regular users here who seem cool  and I'd really like to talk to them more  but there are also people here who drive me nuts  Simply being the FA bucket doesn't mean we're automatically going to like or relate to each other    I am a bit hesitant about posting this but my counsellor keeps saying that I need to be more confident   Sorry if I'm kind of shooting down your idea  I hope this doesn't make you feel shitty  It's just my dumb opinion  Maybe it's selfish   I think I'm afraid that he will move on and I'll be left with nothing  But leading him on isn't right  either   That is something I've never even thought about  So trippy  This hits close to home  I'm truly sorry OP  I know how painful it is to feel like you don't belong anywhere  I've had a few similar experiences to the ones you've posted and more that still haunt me everyday  Things that happened when I was 12 that I still think about at 3AM at 20    I think the worst thing is that I haven't changed  I'm still the lonely  awkward  and unconfident kid I was back then  hoping that a girl might like me one day  Hoping that I could change myself enough to make that a possibility  I feel exactly the same about the majority of what you've said    If you ever need to talk to someone or share experiences and thoughts with  I'm always online   I get acne because my hormones are fucked  and I have really sensitive skin  I was the kid that was allergic to facepaint  for fuck's sake  so I can't use any kind of products that help with it  The only thing that can touch my face is plain  unscented  uncolored soap  Sorry  that's painful   But    I hear a ton of implicit beliefs in your missive    Things which you think are real or true  which shape your experience and interpretation of life    things which "tell you who you are" but rob you of freedom and true self  and leave you alienated in your own world  unable to experience satisfaction  unable to be at home with life  trapped in a past based identity and cut off from the natural richness of being yourself   I love the fact that you're tired of hiding    That's about 40  of the battle right there    "Breaching the ego's walls" is an expression that is apt    the Dark Side of each human is something that we generally want to hide or dress up  in order to conform to social norms    But that hiding makes it very difficult to penetrate into the nature of the darkness and see through it clearly   So sharing is exactly the right thing to do    But it's not the end of the road  by any means   In general  the road has two invariant rules   you need self awareness  and you need courage   The self awareness shows you where you're trapped  and the courage is needed because when you understand a trap  you see that it takes courage to leave it behind    The traps generally come with some kind of addictive bait that keeps you from just opening the door and walking out   You have to be brave to leave the bait behind   I think that you probably don't understand the road very well  though   forward progress involves letting go of fixed beliefs about who you are    Your brain dump is just chock full of identity claims    things like "    a person that values himself as thinking very logically "  That's an identity claim    it's a fixed idea about how you are supposed to be so that you'll recognize yourself   There's bait in that trap  the bait is certainty   "I know who I am" has a bait taste to it    a flavor that keeps you hanging around the dispenser  even though you're caged thereby    This is something to be shed on the road    that addiction to believing yourself to be some fixed "logical thinker"    It's not that logical thinking is bad  it's just that fixed beliefs about your self definition are things which diminish you   All of them   The unbounded possibilities of authentic being cannot be "boxed up" in such self limiting ideas   That kills off your wholeness  that kills off the unity of self    But it buys you a superficial certainty about who you are   The bait   I could go on  there's plenty of that kind of raw material in your post    But it's much better if you re read it through that lens and identify the "clinging to self" by your own inspection   Freedom has a price  the price is the loss of certainty    You won't know who you are in that same comforting and repetitive way    But you'll grow like a forest in rich soil  I thought it'd be either suicide or hooker  Well I'm kind of like you  Idk if your really shy and awkward like me but I pretty much don't spend all my time studying and like to go out  I love basketball and play 3 times a week but yeah I suck   I'm not that athletic or at all but try to be active as much as a I can  I just started lifting and I hope to get a better physique  IDK the problem with me is my quietness and my social skills  IDK if you go to parties or really sociable but I kind of consider myself like you someone that doesn't want to be too popular or a super nerd  I wish I had someone who was like me but I can't  IDK if I am a nerd but I try to consider myself a person with sense  Ahh that's fair  Guess you will plan your evening a little better next time   I'm going to add something   You're   FAR   from the only person to have ever been in your situation  and there's a lot of work that's been done on the best course of action here  I'm speaking from experience  not personal  but from relatives and friends who had children at a very young age      Option A     If abortion is off the table  consider adoption  It really is the best option overall for the child  for you and your girlfriend  and for those around you  It can be a tough thing to do for the mother in particular  but a healthy infant is extremely likely to find a good home with thoroughly vetted parents that desperately want a child  Talk to your girlfriend's gynecologist   they can direct you to the right people to help with the process     Option B    If you are determined to keep the child  this is my advice  throw away your pride  and get all the help you can get      If you're in the US and you do not yet get food stamps EBT  apply   and then go back once the child is born  Talk to a social worker and see if there are any other benefits you qualify for  and accept anything you can get     Talk to your parents and her parents  and or any other relatives  Tell them you want to go to school training etc to make sure you have a good career in the future  and you need their help  Accept whatever they can give    If you can  move in with your parents or hers  Don't be in a rush to get your own place  Not paying  much  rent is a HUGE amount of money you don't have to earn    If you can  don't change your plans for education job training  If you don't have plans  now is the time to make them  Your child will have a better future if you have a good career  and aren't trying to raise a family on a minimum wage dead end job  It will be a rough few years   you will have little time for partying and road trips while in college  But you can push through a part time job and school  and still finish in 4 5 years  Consider community college for your first 2 years   it will give you less of a financial burden  and let you get your education started while your child is in his or her most demanding years   Basically  do all you can to not let the child change your future  It may seem like the "responsible" thing to do is "be a man"  go out and get a job  and hope for the best   but asking for help and then having a rough 2 3 years for the sake of a good stable future after that is well worth the investment   If you absolutely can't get help from your family  can't take care of things with a part time job while going to school  and have no other options   at least try to move away from fast food  Try to find a job as a plumber  welder  or other skilled trade  If you can apprentice under a skilled boss  you can make money comparable to most college degrees within 5 years  and potentially a lot more after you become a master yourself and have your own business  Plus  a lot of people eschew "blue collar" work like that as something not worth doing    meaning job opportunities are out there   Retail work is "easy" and "obvious"  But don't let it be your endgame   it is going to plunge you into a never ending  cycle of just barely getting by   leaving you little to no time to pursue a better carrier   Good luck  Yep  got a scared dog on top of me  and an indifferent cat by my toes    It's getting really warm actually  now that I think about it   Hi there  I'm Jen  What kind of cats do you have   I slept all day and woke up at 11 pm  they were blasting Muzak all day  but what can I do  I'm the weird one who sleeps all day and stays up all night  Gotta suck it up and deal with it  It's 7 30 in the morning now and  very  quiet  I spent it alone sitting here with you guys  I am so fucking pathetic and tonight just reminded me I'm going to be a 34 year old virgin this Summer  Girls find me ugly and creepy  I can't even make friends because I'm so pathetic  I hate my life and despite years of effort  was unable to improve it   Hey thanks for taking the time to write this  I am actually amazing at keeping my sugars where I want  My doctor wants me to be around 120 150 at all times and for every 10 good numbers I have a bad one  I'm very well balanced and eat well     These are my cats  http   imgur com PVNisrp   Orange guy is Henry Beans  calico is Amelia  after the pilot  and the black one is Nugget Dumpsterborn  first of his name  Yeah  that's his real name  Pretty well actually  I made a few friends by approaching them as strangers in public places and striking up a conversation  Normies obviously won't respond well to this kind of interaction so it won't help you befriend that generic Stacey but you'll meet some cool people if you grit your teeth and bear the inevitable rejections  Definitely take up science classes  Biology  Anatomy and Physiology  and Chemistry  See if you can take the AP level classes for those subjects   As for colleges  start looking into schools in your state with good nursing programs if you don't want to go out of state  The local community college by my house has a good nursing program and people usually transfer after doing two three years there  could just fly there  no real need for a car in college anyways   He would be considered creepy  well i just moved to italy because my dad got a job on an american military post   People don't adopt because they have to  but because they want to  Adoption could mean a better life for the child and the new parents  Unfortunately  yes     I want to go to sleep  but it's kind of impossible right now  It's so loud and noisy because of the fireworks   Is there an early college program at your school  Try speaking to a counselor and start there  They can give you information about your options  If it were me  I would start taking classes at a community college  At my high school  there was an early college program for those at least 16 yrs of age  in which at the end of the two year program you'd have your GED or Diploma as well as an associates degree  Not only would it be saving you a bunch of money in the long run  but it would also prepare you for a more rigorous school experience if you decided to pursue medicine  Going along with that  your local community college may have a nursing program or something that sets you up in the medical field  I would try their nursing programs or whatever they recommend before ever looking into the for profit nursing schools    I'm 21 years old and only now decided what I want to study  Don't sweat it  especially since you're still in high school  Good luck     Ack  That doesn't sound too bad to be honest  At least you have a pet keeping you company  That's better than nothing   Probably not  despite the social interaction and pretty girls i think this experience has shown me that i do want to be alone forever which honestly im cool with Ohhhhhhhh  Sorry  I'm not quite familiar with Italy's education curriculum  but I'm sure Biology  Anatomy  and Chemistry are all offered so I would start there at least  Boy I wish I had something worthwhile to spend all my free time on  Maybe then I wouldn't feel so alone   It's a delicate situation  a wrong decision or indecision can cost you  That's   well it's the ugly side of life  But if you explain it and he reacts negatively  that's a good sign staying with him isn't worth the effort  right   I think  speaking as a guy  that if he's really interested in  you   he will be more than understanding and patient with you  For what it's worth  you taught me the word "gaslight " so there's that   Well  atleast you're a  normal 21 year old   pffft   I'm really sorry  though  this is super shitty  I mean I never had the opportunity to get shit on like this  I was just ignored     always  I'll count myself lucky  damn I'm sorry OP   https   www reddit com r ForeverAlone comments 5ldjdn im finally doing it update  st IXE8A3CT sh 29353817 Going to be brutally honest here  all he's looking for is sex  Well shit dude  if you're happy with that  this sounds like a successful night  Happy new year buddy haha Hope is the first step on the road to disappointment    On that note  congrats  Don't screw it up  I don't know whether this is a recognized fallacy but you're making a common thinking error in assuming that the existence of something is evidence for its necessity  The fact that these books exist doesn't mean someone needs to read them to successfully navigate the dating world      Happy new year Fedora  neckbeard and a swarm of flies because of not showering is not enough  amazon overnight it  I dont know  get it yourself then fly over there  not much you could do at this point That sounds like the type of person I'm going to grow up to be  The weird one who stays up all night and sleeps all through the day and has no real job  Then I'll probably complain because I couldn't and didn't get enough sleep   Yeah thats fine just be friendly  and remember your 18 and his daughter's 16  If this guy isn't a creep he'll see you as a kid in his eyes  Be friends with him but if he comes on you tell him straight up that the age gap is to much and you have kids  im not looking to be a mother figure or sister figure to these kids  Personally  I wouldn't  There's no obvious reason for a 50 year old man to go out of his way to meet an 18 year old woman except  frankly  for pleasure   And he's a lawyer  it's his job to be persuasive and appear sincere   And evade direct answers to questions   And he has gone out of his way   This is not something that grew slowly   He is actively pushing things along   I feel it fair to say  as a 60 year old man  that he has an agenda      definitely meant more scary  thanks Oh my god    That sounds horrible  I know this won't be much condolences to you  but happy birthday and happy new year  Hopefully  this year will be a better year  even if it started out shitty  I have to go pick up my little brother from a party sometime soon  So I was told  Hope he calls me soon  I'm falling asleep   The only social media worth using is twitter  You can see news from most companies there   just don't follow real people  Aside from that I use Instagram to share what normies call 'artsy' photos with my family so they feel like they didn't raise a waste of space   Even if I do screw it up  now I know it's possible  and I've already learned a lot   pol  Kappa If it's an electric eggbeater you probably broke it  You can get another for like  20 on Amazon  Just use it for only eggs in the future    This was hilarious and heartbreaking  I think you need a tremendous amount of luck to "make it" as an author  but uh  maybe try just writing about your life experiences  Like a "Me Talk Pretty One Day" kind of thing  If you luck out and get some attention  people would probably be into it  Congrats buddy  That being said   obviously martial arts is not close to the most efficient way to transform your body  I'm good with everything else haha thanks  same to you   We just broke 4000    quite sad tbh Why didn't you just not drink so you could stay at the party  I meant transforming physically and mentally   No other single physical activity does that as well as martial arts  Happy New Year  Yeah  I get what you mean  I feel like I'm wasting my life away  Maybe you can pick up some hobbies  Are you interested in anything in particular   I dont know but this has been the nail in the coffin for whether or not im deciding to be live alone forever because things always end up not working out or there are 50 solutions and im too stupid to see them Honestly I have the same problem with my cousin but much worse  He's jealous of me and makes my life litterally living hell  The best thing to do is to just accept whatever he's doing and just show him love  Because honestly in the grand scheme of things this really doesn't matter  He is your brother  He will be the only one with you once your parents pass away  He will always be there for you so just stick with him and try You didn't read the sticky thread  did you  I wish I could fall asleep and fix my life  In fact  I should probably try to sleep  But anyway  I hope you guys have a happy new year     Hell  id drive  Weight doesn't belong on this list  Hey  thanks dude  It's kinda nice knowing that I'm not alone  even though I obviously wish that you didn't have all that  I appreciate your comment regardless   Either way  happy new year  man  may it be a good one   Why are those 2 things related   Some times a bunch of little issues build up and express themselves in one big way  You probably weren't that upset over the football game  Maybe other things have been getting to you  too  The straw that broke the camel's back   Also  hormones   At last    All the best  Don't come back  Congrats  Where how did you meet her  Interesting  So you now have lasting relationships with these people  or otherwise stemming from these interactions  The hardest part isn't the exercising  It's the time sacrifice and diet change   Make sure you find a routine that isn't longer than 30 45 minutes  I was doing a 2 hour routine and it burned me out after 6 months  Sounds to good to be real  Which ever side you dont agree with I met her while camping lmao  She was actually at the campsite next to mine It sucks spending new years alone  I feel yah  There's maybe a silver lining to this timing  it's a new year  time for new beginnings  I don't know the full story but I would say detach from him completely  don't message him  this is a new chance to re define yourself  yourself as something different  I seriously hope your 2017 is fucking awesome   I'm so sorry  I contracted HIV at the age of 20  and I have no idea how I would've managed if all of that had happened a year earlier  So props for working on rebuilding your life   it's a long  hard slog  but as you're finding out  it's eminently doable    First thing is to take care of your health and get on medications  If you haven't done this  get to a doctor or a sexual health clinic ASAP  Getting to an undetectable viral load will  with any luck  calm you down  You'll feel better  and just as important  it'll make it so much harder  maybe impossible  still an open question just how low the risk of transmission is for a person who is undetectable  to pass along the virus   As for everything else  you're not going to be able to live a satisfying life  with or without HIV  if you keep looking for others to validate your worth  Your worth does not change when you get HIV  just as it does not change when you get a cold  You have an infection  albeit an especially severe one  and you deserve it no more than anyone who gets the flu deserves a week on the toilet  You're not unworthy as a human being  With regards to dating  my initial thought is to tell you to slow down  work on yourself a little bit  then jump back in  Learn to appreciate yourself a bit  If you want to keep dating  you can try out dating sites that cater to people living with HIV  but you don't have to  I wouldn't disclose on the first date personally  the only rule is to not do anything that risks transmission until you disclose  This may mean playing the role of perfect gentleman the first few dates you go on  which is fine  Just remember that lots of people are in serodiscordant relationships and quite happy in them  Loads of resources exist to help you out  like  here  http   www aidsinfonet org fact sheets view 613 and  here  http   www healthline com health hiv aids transmission risks faqs serodiscordant couples Prevention3    Now  if I can pontificate for a little bit  don't you dare say the virus bars you from living a fulfilling life  There are about 37 million people living with HIV globally   am I supposed to actually believe none of them can lead a fulfilling life  Am I myself consigned to a life of misery  What about Magic Johnson or Edwin Cameron  BFD South African judge   They've done alright for themselves  Is your life going to move in a different direction than you thought it might  Undoubtedly  Does that direction have to be less fulfilling  Only if you allow it to be  But don't for a second tell me that my  or your  situation is hopeless  insinuate that I can't be happy  or imply that I can't do meaningful things  I live with HIV  I'm not a bloody vegetable   PM me if you want to talk   Why are you presenting that as a fact  It's pretty strange to use such definitive language when describing things that can not be proven   That's what I've been telling myself for a long time now   I'm still waiting for the let down  but that's dangerous to do  because subconsciously you're undermining yourself and your relationship by thinking like that  Probably  I think I will wait for his birthday instead  Thanks  Dude  David Sedaris is like my number one favorite author  I would love to do a similar thing  with humorous anecdotes from my life    You are right though  "Tremendous amount of luck " And I mean I don't think I've demonstrated that I have that    I'm glad you enjoyed it though  I mean ultimately  what would make me feel best about all my rejection is if I could spin it into some comedy and cheer other people up  so again  it was really nice to know that you thought it was hilarious   Happy new year  Part of me wants to pick up an instrument and expand my knowledge taste in music  I was considering asking to join my school's band and go from there but I feel no drive or motivation to improve or do anything  I don't feel depressed or get suicidal thoughts but it's a terrible feeling and I want eliminate it in 2017  How about you  Are you interested in any particular hobbies  Is there something that has always interested you but you've never actually tried it   Overheard my divorced neighbor lady today talking about last year's NYE  She was fed up with poverty and shit and couldn't wait to get hammered at midnight  then she proceeded to vomit all over the Christmas tree  Happy New Year  Of course it can't be proven  But this is how I went from being lonely all the time to having confidence in my words and actions   These are my ideas and my opinions  and I can only hope that someone here can use even one little part of it  I've relocated and we're no longer in contact but yes  the friendships that came of those approaches were just like the friendships which stemmed from meeting people at school or university or a workplace  Ah  cheers  Enjoy your new word lol     Well  atleast you're a normal 21 year old  pffft   Yeah  Total relief that  Thank god everyone in my age group is depressed and riddled with anxiety to the point that they have trouble functioning   Anyways  yeah  thanks man  I appreciate the comment  Have a great new year  GOOD FOR YOU FRIEND  I HOPE NOTHING BUT THE BEST FOR YOU AND YOU HAVE MY LOVE AND SUPPORT  EDIT  caps Oh I'm consciously undermining myself   You're story seems so alien to me I'm a having trouble accepting any part of it as true   What do you mean by fake exactly     What exactly is "normie stuff" anyway    The usual  school work  social hobbies activities  drinking  going out with friends  showers  And with those experiences and age they become less inhibited and their social skills develop  hence  late bloomers   I wouldn't consider someone who escapes FA at 25  to merely be a late bloomer     And so what if one of them "got lucky" and met someone they were compatible with by   pure chance     Just answered your own question  They can't replicate pure chance     what do they have to do or prove to you for you to approve of their success   3  sexual partners or 1  if they choose to settle down right away  but are able to get more interested if they choose to  Basically they have to show that they can replicate their success and it wasn't just a fluke   Not saying their 1 2 success's are meaningless to them but they don't hold much weight when seeking their advice  Just like you'd rather ask a self made millionaire business owner rather than a millionaire lotto winner how to make money  What a way to start the year  Happy new year to you as well mate     have a good one   "be yourself"   but here's a list of things you need to do and how to dress and act  yeah  ok I can't blame you for that   If you would have asked me anytime during the last 15 years if this could ever possibly happen to me  I would have laughed and gone home and cried myself to sleep   I still tell myself she took pity on me  or I've been misreading this whole relationship and she's actually using me to get at my brother or something   It's difficult to accept  and I don't think I'm fully there yet  Are your shoes loose  If your feet slide around a little  that's a point of friction and the whole forms  Try to tighten your laces or try an insert aww I really love all cats  I got mine from the shelter ones a small black and white named chimney and the other is a smokey  black  polydactyl  tiger ish boy named gremlin Yes     Change them immediately  Happened to me as well  Someone took my keys then stole my car  Get your locks changed   Did you know the person or was it just some randomer  Is if possible it was a person you'd met before and just not remembered them  I have my doubts  However if this is true best of luck to you   you guys are generalizing girls Not all girl go for looks Its about how you present yourself Example How you dress Confidence not to the point you become cocky  funny and this list can go on     You should put a disclaimer that this only applies to retards  Scared for a month  You are horribly  horribly retarded   Thanks Same to you Yes Im a guy and I identify  with this so much but it must be even harder  as a girl since you're supposed to be the emotionally intelligent sex Well Happy New Year  for what it's worth coming from a rando on the Internet  I hope you got those calls  Dude So if you're able to make friends and you actually have friends   what makes you FA in the first place  Right  right  Still retarded  My girlfriend has an IUD   400 for 5 years  Or birth control pills  Or condoms  Figure it out  if you really think so  then break up with your gf and stop having sex This is not about facts  This is just from my own perspective of what I have read  So it is not true nor is it false  Either I missed your story or you did not post it    And lets be honest here  If the post is filled with platitudes and "If I did it you can do it too" bs  Those people never really were FA otherwise that shit would't be even written in the post  My two daughters were sick constantly  One was almost held back due to having colds and the such    BOTH had their Tonsils taken out on the same day     Neither have been sick much since then  their mother and I regret nothing   antarctica   i hear land is suuuuper cheap down there  Wow  that was hard to read  I'm sorry all of this happened to you    I'd hate to break it to you but shit like this still happens when you get older  I'm 29 and I lose friends for no reason all the time  They just stop hanging out one day and when you know it  it's been years since you heard from them again   One of these was my first and best friend I made when I first moved to where I am today  we were inseparable for years  and now  we don't even talk to eachother   All you can do is move on and find better friends   46 years old and never had a New Year's kiss  this is a great expression of your feelings but without some substance here idk how you expect us to help you Hey buddy  I've been where you are  It gets easier  You both fucked up  in ways neither of you probably understand  and won't for a long time  Try to live your life  enjoy your hobbies  maybe get some new ones  It gets easier  She won't do either  Period  She needs to give her head a shake  yes sir  that's generally how small claims are sorted upon the necessary task of removing shit from people wot jpg Nope These are things I did  and they worked for me You need to find what works for you  If your partner isn't willing to work with you or if you can't trust them  why are you even with them  I appreciate that  I posted in this sub to voice my raw frustration than to get answers  I expect nothing at all really  This is my equivalent of screaming in the middle of a mall food court or something  A letter to no one  You should definitely do that  I think you should try to join the school band  Maybe joining it is the first step  Any instrument in particular you want to learn    Oh  I see  How long have you had those sort of feelings  Anyways  best of luck  Hopefully  you do overcome it  Let's hope 2017 is the year for all of us   I have a lot of things that I am interested in  but I have difficulty actually doing it because I'm all over the place and easily unmotivated  But as of late  Judo    I don't have any offline friends currently  Poverty has completely fucked my ability to meet and relate to people  I was joking  Normie like to think their success is the result of hard work  However when they are pressed for details of what they actually did they won't or can't explain it   That attitude is not going to help brochacho  this is an incredible blessing  despite not having the NEED to work   you need to treat your life as a responsibility or else you will be miserable   find something that you love and work hard at it  lazy is universally hated  I never said it has nothing to do with looks  But if you're acting the way you are  you're just shooting yourself in the foot   The overwhelming majority of guys who are misogynists don't get girls  only the very  very attractive ones and it's solely because they're attractive  Don't use a small amount of shitty people to justify you being shitty   Good ol humblebrag  Even on NYE lmao  Why not  Sounds like you know how to do it  Disclaimer  Fish Oil shown to be useless in cardiovascular health specifically  Study not broad enough to declare fish oil outright useless  I know that feeling  I'm guessing an FAer didn't need everything to be perfect to be in a relationship with someone haha   I'm going to be honest here  it might be a little harsh but I went through a very similar situation and this is my experience   Your parents should 100  get a divorce  Your experience with your parents sounds exactly like mine and my parents stayed together anyway to make sure I had a family growing up  The toxic and constantly stressful conditions I grew up in were absolutely not worth it  What I'm trying to say here is that when two people know they shouldn't be together  no matter what the underlying circumstances  there shouldn't be a justification for them to stay together   Your parents involving you like they are is also a monumental failure on their part  You should have next to no involvement in the arguments  logistics  they should not be talking behind each other's back to you  and they should not be asking you to relay messages or make decisions for them   Time will heal these wounds and you will know it was a good choice  especially if they can have a healthy relationship after the smoke clears   As far as financial support  you should try to get on your feet as fast as possible  Even if you "decide" for them to not divorce  it won't change the built up tension  which will continue to get worse  and if it snaps and they do it anyway  you'll need a backup plan for sure   Good luck  my friend  Same  brother  same My boyfriend was 19 when I met him as well  Been together 3 years now  I was his first kiss and everything  Hope to be like you guys   And congrats on a long relationship     hard to move on isn't it though  they are all wishing me happy new year  but I'm not sure if they really mean it though This is not your decison to make  And shame on your parents for putting that onto you   You need to tell your parents to be adults and make the decison themselves  Or is not yoir marriage  It is there's   I "be myself" by playing video games and watching anime in my room all day  no gf yet   And inb4 you tell me why this doesn't work  if I have to take up hobbies that I hate and act like how I wouldn't  then I wouldn't exactly "be myself " Pick something for this moment  I don't drink for the sake of not liking the feeling so completely understand   I also don't drink at all anymore because I want control of things and I'm 22 male who use to drink all the time  I saw some polydactyl cats once down in Key West at Hemingway's house  They are so cool looking    I adopted the two kittens this year and are getting them used to being cuddled  I'm financially crippled so there's not a lot of activities I can engage in  Anything beyond walking distance is too far and anything that isn't free is prohibitively expensive  Sorry  I misunderstood  It is 7 am so did't really see the  normie  I would look for one in Canada Idk everyone seems to try to live to conform to others  I feel like I one is like me   How come  Dude calm your shit  It was 5 years ago  You need to move on with your life and forget about it  Stop holding a grudge because you lost a fight  It happens    Move on  Thats truly horrible  I clicked on your post because I hate coming home for break too  hopefully its the last time  since I graduate soon   but your post makes my time here seem like a breeze  I know you didn't ask for advice  but try to support your brother as much as possible  You both are in this together  Keep going to therapy too  and keep your head up  You'll be back at school soon   Ideas are a dime a dozen  Execution is everything   Legally you don't owe him anything  but in addition to the emotional fair aspect of keeping him compensated  there is a term of art in business called the nuisance factor    If your idea becomes successful and you totally snub your friend  there is a good chance of getting sued    Look at how many nuisance suits Zuckerberg had to deal with at FB    The better way is to cut him in now and in doing so force him to sign a legal release absolving you of any liability to him for taking your idea   The best way to compensate your friend is with stock options rather than straight equity   5  is probably attractive from your perspective  and 10 15  would be a more generous "finders fee "   You could also throw him a board seat if you appreciate his vision and advice     If you are serious  a lawyer could help you form an LLC and get the capital structure in place    But for now you could just sign a 1 sentence agreement with him that says you will do those things once and if you get more traction with the idea  that is  once you get the app close to developed and get a little seed capital   Probably not a router problem  It's most likely your service is just shit either because your provider is boning you or your bandwidth is being chewed up by other people watching Netflix  payola for their contributors Some people do  some people don't  Maybe teens do more than most  I guess the older you are  the less you care if people judge you for being yourself  Why it doesn't  I think it does  A good number of people probably overeat and don't exercise enough but I'm sure there are some people who have legitimate medical problems that caused weight issues  Lol it's hard as fuck to become hercules esque so I doubt it's a issue getting abs however is hard but doable If you are working maybe you could move to a shared flat  you don't have to stay with your parents   Also  you could look for a counsellor therapist   or at least someone you can trust   and start talking about what is worrying you  You really don't have anyone  Don't kick him out  What he did is awful and cannot be excused  but he flew to spend 3 months with you so you at least mean something to him  I normally would say talk it out but   3rd time   that's not working obviously  I don't know what kind of person he is but be better than him and simply tell him he has to find somewhere to go or fly back asap  They say once a cheater  always a cheater  But hey  who knows  Either way  you don't have to deal with this  It's hard enough being in a long distance relationship and with the absence of trust and loyalty  this isn't going anywhere  Good luck to you  I'm gonna take a shot in the dark and day you're maybe 14  You're severely overreacting  Maybe just unblock them and relax  Act like nothing happened  and it'll never get brought up again  I was in the middle school band but didn't care enough to join high school band because the high school band seemed up be one big joke  I might go for the baritone    I've been feeling this way since may of last year  I'm just confused and I feel like I'm facing a midlife crisis and I don't think I'm even at the halfway mark  s let's make 2017 our year  I see people complain about 2016 and I feel like we often forget that what we should change is how we act  That's what makes a difference  not the year      Let's stay committed and motivated in 2017  But don't depend too much on motivation  Motivation is more of a feeling and it can go away  Instead lets go for good habits and stuff   Then to be fair you weren't that socially awkward  If a guy who doesn't know you at all decides to talk to you it's understandable that you were short with him  What medical problems  That is not true  I'm positive weight doesn't belong on this list   It's a lot of effort for the rest your life  It sucks but get used to it it's very important  Bingo  You'll be fine  Learned a lesson in muting your mic when you're not using it lol Yeah Im a teen  It sucks  I mean I wish I was at a couple of parties and had friends but no one relates to me I guess  I mean i love basketball and sports but like everyone just wants to do that stupid snapchat bs and I just can't talk to anyone  It was within weeks he started improving  It has been a year now and the difference is mind boggling  Steady improvement all year   damn that's great man  my 20th bday is next week and so far no luck   your post gives me hope tho  do you have any advice  was this girl like a good friend of yours or someone you met recently  So what did you do for the remaining 29 minutes and 30 seconds   Just kidding m8  Congratz  D I hope this is the start of a fantastic 2017 for you  No   When visiting a couple always sit in between them  preferably on a couch made for 2  Since when does playing sports not help you find friends  The times have changed  I'm in your boat buddy  I'm two years into my CS degree and the only reason why I took this route is because I'm good at it and I don't want a labor job  been there done that     My current strategy is to just keep working through college and hopefully I'll stumble on something that I actually would see myself doing every week for a few years  We're not the only ones either  apparently a lot of people have this problem  Worst case scenario we finish school and still have no motivation  but what we do have is that fancy piece of paper that should make us more money than a fresh hs graduate  I love the caps  Thank you so much  You don't have to be lonely at herpes only dot com Haha yeah  More of a lesson in not taking things too seriously tho  Throughout life you'll learn that people can be pretty shitty  Sucks you had to learn early  If you still care to be friends with these people  you could try to sit down and ask them  maybe one on one  whats going on  Otherwise  just move on with your life  Maybe try for a fresh start when you go to high school  if you can    Chin up though  you have a bunch more New Years Eve's to enjoy with great people you'll meet in life  Happy New Year  Wat do you mean  You acknowledge people don't play sports that much anymore   I think my biggest fear is a ways down the line when the hurt has worn off and tempers cool  I've seen similar family drama boil down  simmer and then suddenly the person who made the change for the better gets blamed for the leftover rift  I don't want my husband to resent me one day because it's been made very clear to me that I will be the one to sever our ties     But that's more my paranoia than something he has made me believe will happen  I know this anecdotal experience doesn't mean that's what's going to happen  for one my husband seems even more upset than I am  just not very good with words and knows he probably wouldn't handle it right  but I suppose in the end part of me also wants to take what I see as the highroad  Some good advice here has me giving them a couple months to get jobs  but when I think about the lease only being about 6 more months and a good  solid  final point I feel like if I give them at least that much more time  a bit of a final warning  I can truly say that I gave them all the time they could need without glaring them down  At this point I don't even consider it being a martyr because I'm not doing it to be altruistic  Instead of lighting a fire under them where they scrape by and make it over the finish line  meeting some measly deadline that should have been a year ago  there's instead a brick wall they will suddenly come up against where they will turn around  look back  and see that they did not do everything they could have  or at the very least the sprawling unfairness  and I can say goodbye  I'm not exactly rooting for them to fail  but at this point I would find it all too convenient if they suddenly get to work  That's not a good precedent for down the line  none of what has happened is a good precedent even months ago  and I'm not stupid anymore  I'm sad about the situation and various other things  but there is an end in sight at the least  Maybe you could focus on yourself instead of comparing with others all the time  because that's the only thing you really have control over  And the military really is a good option   if  he marries this girl  If he doesn't  he can't consider her a dependent and it's unrealistic that he'd win custody in court over the baby  which would need a care taker when he goes on deployment anyways   But if he did  the pregnancy  birth  and healthcare while serving would all be covered and they'd pay him extra for having family    However  the military will only work if you marry the girl you got pregnant with  or else it's a crap shoot and will only make life more difficult  It's very unlikely that you two will stay together anyways  and the service breaks people  Like  I've never seen more depressed people like I did while deployed on a ship  It breaks hearts  marriages  and people's sanity  The struggle  is  real  It's no fucking joke  Don't consider it an easy out     I was saying I'm surprised you play sports and can't find friends  Most of my closest friends were made this way  Cease contact  do not go to lunch  absolutely do not humor him anymore  If he shows up to your work make sure you let someone know  Let the police know if you have to  If he starts harassing you definitely let the police know  Not trying to scare you  it's just better to be safe than sorry  I don't know girls I talk to tell me I'm funny  kind  have great personality and like talking to me but they never want to be my girlfriend I think my looks is the biggest deal breaker maybe I'm just talking to the wrong girls     I'm not one to usually say just walk away but this is a sketchy situation  She's playing games and being manipulative  these tendencies will only get worse as the relationship progresses   Stop visiting subs that condone sexslavery and rape then lol Friends  family  and our health care system   What you should do is schedule an appointment with a therapist once the holiday is over   While it's normal to feel lonely at times  it's a little alarming to shift the blame on everyone  and humanity as a whole  to blame social media  to want to throttle anyone you see outside  to see everything as disgusting and decayed   and to cope with all of this with alcohol   It sounds like you have some form of anxiety at the least  perhaps something else more complicated  and a therapist  can help you identify and remediate  even if there is no underlying issue  Seeing a therapist is not shameful  no more so than seeing a doctor for a physical problem   Right on man My standards are pretty much not obese  overweight is fine pretty much everything is fine not that it matters Your advice is very sound and thought out  There's a lot I will be plucking from this and some that my husband and I have already thought about  Particularly the bit at the end  scheduling time away following our breakup  That's definitely something we should consider  At any rate  we do have an end in sight  We definitely aren't legally obligated to them and we don't owe them anything  Even if he's not religious or part of their personal community  that's what they  should  be there for  So hopefully  only advice ive ever gotten is to suck it up until you get used to it  i can work a 60 hour week on my feet no problem  but it takes a bit to get used to it if its not consistent or you've been off your feet for a while  I knew a chef once who I had seen work 100 hour work weeks on his feet when we were short on staff  great man too its just too bad people start to lose their sanity after that much work  Every so often ill do a stretch at work to loosen up and it seems to help  Goodluck This is actually quite sweet  I wish he could read this  That would probably be all he needs   Why not plan for a 4 0 and bust your butt to get it  You can do it    it makes everyone and everything on earth suffer and feel scared   Few years   Shit   something like that is happening in 3 weeks  https   en wikipedia org wiki United States presidential inauguration   TBH  I didn't read the whole thing  But I can tell you that that want to get divorced and want your blessing  They wouldn't ask you unless they wanted clear conscioses   Tell them to go ahead with the divorce  You'll all be happier   No  I really hope nothing like that happens in my life time  Sorry   haha I mean there is one relatively easy way but yeah it's not supossed to be easy since suicide is rarely the right call even though it may seem thst way  Happy for you bud I'm glad everything got straightened out  I know you wish you could drop weight quicker  but that's not what it's about  It's about commitment and lifestyle change  I hope you can stick with it  someday all the guys will wish they were with you  I would sincerely like to call you a douche nozzle with kindest regards for suggesting an abortion    Nah but forreal  put it up for adoption  she'll have a lot more mental psychological issues breakdowns with an abortion Take some time now to practice on the highway  You could even go out with your dad on the highway s few times  as well  You could always look for a ride share for someone else to drive  or for companionship  who is going back to Texas for school just as you are    If you stick to about 8 10 hours of driving and maybe 400 500 miles a day it will be a reasonable trip  I've done it in all sorts of weather  If you belong to AAA you can a free trip pack that will break down the routes with note about construction or go with a good GPS    In general  breakfast is the best meal of the day on the road because it is the cheapest and you get the most for your money  Have your car and tires checked out so you won't have any mechanical problems along the way    You can do this but it will cost you  all estimates for 4 days  gas   120   motels   350  and food   100   I am assuming that you stay at standard good motels and eat at least two good meals a day  With other expenses it may cost about  600 total for the whole trip    You definitely want a car in Texas   Edit  Last line  Everything we do is based on fear anyway  It is way more subtle but still is there   This is true  There are sketchy invalid tests sometimes  but a clear positive is always positive   Waiting for final results might just mean waiting for confirmation via bloodwork  which actually has more to do with confirming the hCG levels are high enough to be a healthy pregnancy  My doctors office doesn't even offer confirmation bloodwork unless requested  a bfp home test is proof enough   That being said  even if the pregnancy isn't viable  which this early is still a possibility   parents should still be involved like    now  Well  try to think from their perspective  Why would they invite you  Why should they invite you  Answer these questions and you'll answer your own    Problems might seem random and with no obvious solution  but it's only until you really look into the problem that you begin to notice some things  I read your post and it seemed okay until the "It's as if everyone thinks I'm part of someone else's group  so in the end I'm part of no ones" part  That's the part that raised a red flag  Your assumption is that the reason you aren't invited anywhere is because people just think you're part of someone else's group  but I can tell you that's not how it works  It might apply to attractive people as you know  but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you're average looking  so that this post will probably maybe resonate with you    The case is probably that you aren't a memorable person  So you don't stick out in people's mind enough to make them think  "hmmm I want him at my party " Well why don't you stick out  Are you a boring person  Could you honestly say that you stand out from the crowd  and that others would agree with that  Keep in mind that you don't have to be VIP special for someone to invite you  it's that you have to stand out of the crowd just enough to be noticed  If you don't  then how exactly will they differentiate you from the others kids in class    If you aren't making an effort to connect with people beyond a "hey" sort of acquaintance  don't expect them to make the effort to send you an invite  I don't know  It doesn't really matter though  There's no reason for a guy his age to want to "befriend" you  especially the way he did  From what you described either he's crazy or he wants something sexual  Either way there should be no reason for you to take this any further  and if he starts pressing that's immediately a bad sign and you'll want to start taking countermeasures  That's just an If though  He'll hopefully just leave you alone and that'll be the end of it  I mean I don't really play  I was Never on a team just played pickup a few years ago  I also just started going to the gym and joined he frisbee club I don't think he'll be enough to start something world changing  Who knows tho  I don't know politics well atleast you have good morals still I don't have any friends to whose weddings I could even go  so your situation could worse  It depends upon your field and your job prospects  You have to judge that for yourself because there may be many more opportunities in the US  despite the draw of your homeland   I mean pre internet dating was all about your networks       Who do you go to school with    Who are your neighbors    Who are your friends  and in turn who are their friends    Who do you work with     Anyone you dated was usually someone that has some form of connection to you whether it is geographical  family  friend  etc     Because of that  your dating pool was much more limited so people were much more willing to "settle" because you really don't know who else is out there     Nowadays people have so much choice so people are much less willing to settle  So many people think "the one" is out there and they're willing to hold out for them   I didn't read all of that  I'll admit  I got broken up with 3 4 months ago  and its still really hard  But lord  I wish I had someone as afraid to lose me as you were of losing her   Thanks for the feedback  In the future  consider saying "I'd like to take you out" Do you know why your Dad doesn't want you to get one   I would start the conversation with that   And honestly  if you are looking to go to higher ed  it is probably a worthwhile trade off to wait a few years for the tattoo  because college is a serious financial commitment  assuming that you are in the US   It's possible that your Dad's motivation may be narcissistic and a want for control   But it is also quite possible that he is considering things that might not occur to you   At 16  you still have a few years for growing   if you get a tattoo now  your changing body shape might stretch your skin and distort it in ways that aren't flattering   Are you going to be paying for the tattoo yourself   Good work can be pricey  and when you are older  and likely have a little bit more disposable income you can do more research and pick a great artist without having to worry as much about the cost   Upkeep   if you participate in any extracurricular activities  keeping it covered and properly cared for during the healing process might not be workable   And finally  I know that teenagers hate to hear it  but a lot of things that sound like a great idea when you are a teenager do not seem like a great idea to you just a few years later   it doesn't always feel like it  but the judgement part of your brain is still doing a lot of maturing now and for a few more years   If I had gotten a tattoo when I was 16  I would say that there would be at least a 75  chance that I wouldn't be happy with it now  Im so sorry you experienced this  The shit that you have gone through is just shocking and I honestly feel for you  I agree with what the other Redditor said about how difficult it is to make it as a writer  but I also think its not necessarily impossible  Maybe you can just write as a hobby  Also  I think that you should write about your life experiences    "Things I liked  the length  1 100 words   Things I didn't like  the plot  characters  style  voice  dialogue  and themes  If Im correct  1  100 words is around 2 3 pages  Was it a short story or just a few pages into the piece that you were working on  If you dont mind  I can critique your work honestly and try to provide constructive criticism    Anyways  happy New Year and hopefully  it is a better year  I would definitely move to the US  i think a change is always nice and its not like theyre tryina put you in the middle of nowhere like kansas or something so yeah id say do it Sounds like you're on a good path man  Yea but no one is aware of it  I want people everyone to be so scared to the point where even the closest of friends start screwing each other over in order to get higher ground It sucks but he is your legal guardian and you're a minor therefore what he says goes  I'm in love with tats  Currently planning out my full sleeve  money and time  with the artist  However  him threatening to not pay for your college is shit  College is a struggle as it is and loans suck  However  college isn't his responsibility either  You're fully capable of going to school and paying for it yourself  I don't think he'd legitimately not pay for your schooling if he planned on doing so if you got a tattoo but I do think he's right in making  wanting to make  you wait   Did you like band in middle school  Did you play baritone in high school  Why did you think it was like a big joke  That's awesome  you should definitely go for it  Maybe the high school band is actually better than you think it is  Btw  tell me how it goes  when and if  you join    Oh wow  so quite a while  Have you told anyone about it  like your family   Haha  so fake it until you make it  But yes  we should  2017 should be our year  Thanks for the advice  I'm gonna take it to heart  I kind of feel better about the new year   Anyways  good night  The fireworks have finally stopped  thankfully   So  I'm gonna go to sleep now   See a doctor  Anti depressants can really work for some people  It's taken me trying 7 different ones over the past 10 years but I think it's worth it   Yea I hate how people are born rich and with good genetics while others are cursed with a disability they couldn't avoid and live a poor life  I want everyone to suffer together and see what it feels like It's a lose lose situation anyway you look at it     No for self promotion  I'd like to think so but love isn't enough and let's face it most of us here are broken in some way and don't see a "fix" coming anytime soon    Either we don't have energy for change or just mental issues or something we can't change in rare circumstances  all I know we are alone in this world and suffering for it  We have a physical and mental need for companionship and if we don't find something to fill this void what do we have   I hope you guys are able to find help from a therapist or something because this is at eating us from the inside and every day a part of us is lost   it dies and as time passes there is less and less to recover  So I hope you can find something to fill this void even if it is just partially so you can put it in the back of your mind and have a fullfilling life and maybe find love one day unexpectedly  What'd u do  Make concrete  I went through something similar  It sucks  But    Its not the kid's choices  We have no place and no say in our parents' marriages  Recognizing and accepting that is a step towards adulthood    Edit  wrong pronoun I was brought up with Islam but don't believe anymore  Those who believe in the religion will always pull the context card and try to justify the filth in the Quran using history or hadith or sunnah  Bottom line is that the Quran says many times that it does not need any of these to be understood  Therefore  the book is meant to be taken as is   You sister must have gone to college to be an officer    If you join any service  such as the Air Force  it will only be for 4 years and you can take tests and choose a career field that may give you a real foundation for the rest of your life  Being stationed anywhere in the world is a crap shoot but there are real opportunities for travel and adventure so that's the luck of the draw    It's okay to make mistakes and try out new things because you can always make changes and moves that will enrich your life  If you don't make choices they others will make them for you  Mostly because I can use plant based ones in salads and foods as a flavour enhancer   Also  CBC marketplace in Canada did a show on fish oils   They ran several lab tests and found most fish oils to be rancid by the time we even get them   Once they are rancid they can actually be toxic   I can get Hemp seed oil locally lroduced as I live in the prairies  I think that may be the real problem  we can't get passed our looks for ourselves in the first place  Thank you for your bluntness      Elsewhere here I mentioned that I'm hoping for the end of our lease to be our cutoff point for somewhat selfish reasons  Of course it won't be the day the lease is up that they find out we're not happy  I'm sure they already know on some level  but we will give them warning   At this point I don't feel like I want to salvage the situation because they have proved to be more than a little inept at adult ing  If they get jobs and contribute at some point in the next couple months  great  especially because that would mean they might be more amenable to moving out on their own  but at this point I cannot see myself living with them any longer  I don't recommend drugs for this  no    I do have experience with LSD  it's been a long time  and I don't think it's necessary for self understanding    I was a Zen student  so I like mindfulness practice as a growth tool   A more thorough take on my view can be found here  https   antiblog quora com The structure of transformation srid C3lY Congrats mah dude  enjoy this feeling of happiness for the rest of your days  Sorry you're gonna have to get better internet Ya  it's not fair buddy  I completely agree with everything you said  I was born rich with good genetics  It's also not fair how you want people like me to suffer for things we couldn't avoid either  Thank you for sharing this  I'm much younger than you and I now feel a sense of hope for myself   For awhile I've had friends hooking up and even losing their virginity at a young age while I'm here geeking over games and computer stuff   Thank you again and congrats    I agree with those here who advise caution  HonestlyKidding's post seems to be on the mark  You should follow Mcdok's advice and cease contact because no good can come of it and he had way too much experience to be texting an 18 year old woman with the line he's given you  Current research does not portray saturated fats as harmful   and show they increase total cholesterol by increased levels of HDL cholesterol  Furthermore dietary cholesterol does not effect serum levels   Aside from algae  there are no other sources of DHA or  EPA     I do not believe a person is capable of eating enough algae to get adequate amounts without using some form of concentrate     Plant based is such a vague nonsense term    Is beef plant based  as cows are vegans    Print one on your computer  I haven't been diagnosed with depression yet depression because I haven't gone to the doctor yet  I don't know how am I going to explain this to my parents  I just know I have struggle with suicidal thoughts for as long as I could remember but never attempted  I thought they were normal  Also I've been isolating myself more and more for almost a year now so I get really nervous and anxious when I see my friends again  I don't even know if it's depression  I don't want to self diagnose myself   That may be true  The post makes a point though  We mourn and honor those who die in the accomplishment of the mission  but once the mission is over we forget about those that lived through it   Lost friends  Broken homes  Broken minds  Financial struggles  The occasional taboo of being a former service member and the struggles that brings from finding jobs to social life    Edit  Thats why you see a lot of vets looking after other vets   How old are you first it would help Except it's not just you or other people born to succeed  it'll be everyone that suffers  Only way things will be fair  and people will finally feel what the less fortunate have felt all their lives  I am hoping to be happily suprised   but I doubt it and if god is real why is there so much disease starvation etc  Why hasn't he shown himself if he wants us to follow him  Are we expected to follow an invisible entity without any proof other than hearsay  No I  Expect there's something awaiting us alright  a void  an abyss pure nothingness swallowing us up and going to a dreamless sleep eternally  So true  I was in five years  It's not an easy out but the benefits are good  At the very least his kids healthcare would be covers if they did joint custody  Which it sounds like there's no trouble in paradise   It's just general stuff  Trying to talk to people more often and become someone who is fun to be around  Like  I'm an introvert but learned how to stop using that as an excuse  I used to be pretty quiet which is okay  but you have a lot more fun if you actually  do  something  I'm suspicious that my mom wants to divorce  but she's worried that I would be hurt by it  How do I tell her that I support her if she wants to leave him but stay in my place and not try to play marriage counselor  Lol http   www cancer org cancer news omega 3 fatty acids linked to increase in prostate cancer risk This is the first thing I thought of  too  Your shoes are too big  I wouldn't say anything specific  Just trying to be more talkative with my co workers and take interest in their thoughts and feelings  It absolutely wasn't something that instantly became part of me   took a year and a half to get to where I am now  Step by step Have you let it cool down completely   If not  unplug it  let it cool for several hours  and try again   But if that doesn't work  then it's probably dead     people like that are scumbags but yeah pretty solid advice I guess I'm agreeing with you o o How is your resume and what are you applying to  New year new you  put that all behind you    HAPPY  lol Same  I did five years as a HM  Saw so many pregnant women with deployed boot husbands and shit sometimes worked out but there was so much stress placed on both parties  I just don't want the OP to think all issues will be solved because recruiters love to play this scenario up  they know they can snag people in with situations like this  OP won't have anything to barter with because his options are so limited on what else he can do   Weed helps but the damage has already been done   I try to write a poem every day on my blog as self therapy as well   http   the54thdeadline com  Right  You are targeting me haha  Fuck man  I have everything I could ever want in life  but I also had a stroke that kills most people that have it  I have some nice issues because of it  Everyone knows what it's like to suffer  I'm going almost through the same thing right now with my parents showing signs of needing divorce  and I wish they asked me what your parents asked you  because I would 100  say yes  From what I've seen of some of my friends' parents  if you can't live with your spouse  and you divorce  everyone gets happier  There may be bad blood or a little legal trouble in the beginning  but it is not damaging in and of itself  For your situation  I can see where trouble may lie  but only you know whether or not the risks you listed are worth your parents' freedom from one another  So why are you going after randoms on Tinder if you're so worried about this  Your logic doesn't make a ton of sense  Why do you feel this way  If you need an ear  I am here for you pal   I take Klonopin for anxiety and ketamine for depression  I haven't noticed any side effects beyond mild drowsiness from the Klonopin  and no side effects from the ketamine  Yo I'm like tipsy right now from NYE but can try to give tips  Friends went to bed  party was at my house  so I decided to get on Reddit before bed since I usually stay up late thanks to work lol  Unfortunately idfk how to explain this in a way that makes it easy  But it just happens over time when you take yourself out of your comfort zone  One thing that helps is to force it on yourself by joining a club organization or getting a job or something similar  Before joining choir in high school I just came home and played Minecraft or Runescape all day all weekend  By the end of high school I eventually had friends and even a prom date due to choir  If you just put yourself out there it will be a decent experience even if it's awkward to begin with  Good advice  In the USA  arm's length  Thank you for this  It may sound like 'just a clich'  but it was the encouragement that I needed to hear  We spent part of our night out at her friend's house for New Years  In just a casual night out  we got to talking more again  On our way there  it was mostly silent  but on our way home  there was hardly a break in conversation  I guess I forgot how great of a team we really were  We got home  ate  and fell asleep to Criminal Minds on the couch together rather than her or I just jumping on a game  I think we really needed a night out as we haven't been out together for quite a while  Waking up to read your message has helped inspire and strengthen what I was starting back towards in my heart  Again  thank you so much for such a heartfelt response   This has to be a troll post  right  I guess that post that made it from the front page brought a lot of new people in  My personality is a completely rotten turd by this point  joke's on them bro it's not just you  what about all the good looking college guys and girls who just party all the time  make love  and don't need to worry about anything because of rich ass parents  They live life on easy mode  their struggles is not getting 100 likes on an instagram post  fuck them Thanks  man because  as cliche as it sounds  the closest thing to an "answer" is Be yourself because at the end of the day people will like you for you  It's time to get a real therapist and get to the bottom of this  Do it now while you're young  Hug bro  Talk about interest  Music  hobbies  books  Don't talk about family  work  politics  religion  Damn dude   it was rough before the birthday plot twist    It takes years to appreciate somebody's great personality   This is a really great point that a lot of people seem to miss   Have my upvote  Do you have any idea how stupid you sound  Have you ever had an original thought in your life  I was in the same boat as you  I graduated high school with a 1 9 gpa but after hard work and determination I cruised through undergrad and now i'm in a masters program with a 3 5 gpa  Don't settle for anything less than the best  Set your goal to be a 4 0 and work your ass off to get as close as you can  Nothing beats hard work  Believe in yourself  Congrats  Now go and never look back    They probably do mean it  Maybe they're not as close as they once were  but that's no reason to believe they're being intentionally deceitful or mean spirited    They're probably not "betraying" you or anything so intentional  They're just growing away from you a bit  and it's okay if you grow away from them too  Maybe someday you'll all grow closer    I'm sorry that your evening sucked so much though  I really hope tomorrow is better for you  If you're into guitar and want something new to distract you  may I suggest you look into Mike Oldfield  He was the third person to ever knock themselves off the number one spot of the charts in the UK  after the Beatles and Bob Dylan  Come to Butthead    I know it's not just me haha  You didn't know me before posting this  Just consider their position though  They were born into their situation just like the people with disabilities  It's unfair to hate someone for something they can't change   like being black  gay  FA  or rich and attractive   Honestly  simplify your goal Don't think of the minimum of what you have to get in order to get in this 1 university  Your goal should be     Grind today  the next day  and the next day    If you strive for the best  you will go to the best  All you have is your best  If you give it your all you will get something great back  And I am proud of your effort to strive for more after getting a low GPA in high school  Some would quit  and you are not  Get that 4 0  Thank you so much   I hope you have a beautiful night     You're welcome  It's a very uncomfortable position to be in  so I would prefer to help you through it   u Tall Mickey is right about peanut butter as well  It carries plenty of protein if meat isn't your thing  so the apple peanut butter combo is definitely a win in two fields  I wish you luck  Hope your appetite curbs  Well  there's a lot that is disappointing about this sub  but I like it when we support each other  I wish you all the lady luck too      Happy 2017  It's really not  If you keep trying and and keep pursuing  IT WILL HAPPEN  I promise you  It's the dedication that keeps certain people interested  I know I'm going to have a miserable year because I'm still alive  I do the whole emotionless thing  it just makes my parents think I don't give a shit about what they're saying Yeah but still suck at sports and not big yet even though I am working out I'm trying to be strong as possible  Thank you and Happy New Year  Stay safe out there  bioavailabilty is higher in meat products for some things  however something like algae oil gets rid of that problem on the omegas  but plants can and do supply all necessary nutritional needs  I box read party  still feel empty and angry     Even four months is not very long to know someone before moving in with them  especially if it's their place and you're essentially a guest  I get that living with your mom and stepdad is less than ideal  but from what you've said it's a stable and loving environment  just with too many rules  That doesn't seem to me like a good enough reason to leave  Doing chores every day is a reality no matter who you live with  and a curfew is annoying  but it's mostly for safety and is a pretty good idea as long as it's a reasonable curfew   If you feel like it's too early  maybe bring that up with your mom  as an adult living under her roof  you should have balance and compromise between the two of you   Also  don't underestimate the value of being able to save the money you'd otherwise be spending on car insurance and phone bills   I know from experience that living in someone else's house is tough  even if you get along well  and that it's a lot harder when it's an adult who's not a parent  I lived with my uncle for a few months while I was apartment hunting  He's great  and it was amazing to have a safe place to go  rent free  while I was figuring things out  But at the same time  I couldn't really be a full adult while living under his roof  but also didn't have the comfort of already having a parent child routine  because I'd never lived with him before  I suspect it would be the same with your girlfriend's parents  You're an adult  but you'd be in their space and dating their child  which kind of makes you a child too  regardless of age  It's uncomfortable to feel like you're in someone else's home   All in all  it seems like you're in a decent situation  and you shouldn't throw that away for an awkward one just because it's not ideal  Save up instead for your own place  with the girlfriend too if that's what you two want  wow  that's deep    Even if someone oozed confidence but was still lacking in the looks department he would be constantly rejected left and right   I knew guys like this   Everyone liked them sure but dating  love  sex  etc   Oh yeah hell no  I wont ask them  They'd make a big issue out of something that isnt serious  and they would do the exact opposite  these are alcoholics   I am trying the gluten free diet when I get home    I got flaked on too by friends this year and it does suck  I'm sorry you had that happen   happy new year  i don'r know if I want to go into detail  I just kind of want some general tips for me because I sometimes think I say something mean because of timing or just something that shouldnt havebeen said I didn't get invited to do stuff but I'm exhausted from working the holidays    Might as well pick up a new year's shift   That's the spirit  Hey  I'm at my first party ever as an adult since my bf of 15 years passed away 4 years ago  I already had social anxiety so as you can imagine it just got worse   I'm actually in the spare bedroom now  waiting to pass out because I actually had some drinks  Im drunk but it didn't suck and I had fun and I didnt get sloppy  I think   Go you  Go me    PS That took way too long too type   Maybe make a video of and instead of twitch live straining  just upload vid Why is it only people who don't even post in this subreddit  or lurkers  allegedly  that make farewell threads    And judging by his post history  OP wasn't even FA before this god sent relationship of his   I find it pretty bizarre why people do this  I'm thinking it's just personal catharsis with the pretext of giving hope to us  i also think that i may say some rue things  for example  by sometimes not accepting food offered by people im visiting  sometimes they make weird faces  so i think i said something  wrong  other times  I feel as if Im too harsh to people and as if they are thinking what im thinking which may result in me acting douchy  for example answering a question sarcastically like the other person should know the answer to  and saying things like "duh"  but i think in some cases this is good because their maybe some really obvious info that someone was supposed to know but they dont  No  there's no guarantee that it will happen  You're a so ignoring the fact that most people here have been trying different things for years and nothing has worked  The whole "be yourself" thing doesn't work because that person is exactly who people dislike   There's no guarantees at all and people end up alone all the time  It happens   Good luck OP  I'm bisexual myself and I know what it's like to come out to family  I hope it goes brilliantly     If it's ok  keep us updated   I know it's annoying  but be happy they just want you to have a good time  They just don't understand what a good time is for you  I tried it and unfortunately it didn't work  I really wish instagrams help center was better  yay  Did you get them working again  I just use the default iOS keyboard  Perhaps if you spoke to your mother about it  he might take it better from her    Sounds terrifying and like an accident waiting to happen  Good luck  get a vasectomy Hi there  Im definitely no trained professional therefore I'm just giving my advice based on personal experiences  as I've struggled with depression and anxiety for a few years now  Im also young so I understand    It definitely seems like you have some anxiety  and mild depression  based on the mood swings and low self esteem  Don't take my word for it tho  I definitely suggest getting a real diagnosis from a trained professional   What I can help you with is coping skills  Coping skills is one of THE MOST important skills to have  So with the anxiety  what I recommend is breathing exercises  Focus on your breathing  and just have your internal cheerleader yelling   Keep telling yourself "hey not everyone is staring at me  They're looking at me but not judging me   AND if they are it's rather rude of them " Just reassure yourself and eventually you'll start to believe it   With the mood swings and depression  tell yourself this  it will past  Think about why the sudden shift  why you're feeling that way  what you can do about it  and do what you can that will positively help you  If you can't do something that's fine   Understand some things are out of our control and that is okay   When or if you start having violent wants  separate yourself from what you want to do  acknowledge that won't help you and distract yourself  Read a book  play games  ANYTHING to distract you  Distraction is very useful and helpful   I hope I helped a little bit    if these symptoms get worse or develop anymore please get help  Don't be afraid to ask for help  I was  and waiting only hurt me more       That's what you tell yourself  But TRULY put yourself out there and Test yourself  the results won't be anything worth doubting  people are not made to die alone You wouldn't be on this subreddit if you didn't feel that there was something wrong in being alone  So  do it and try  because if you don't you will live with that regret and that's a live you don't want to live  You're absolutely welcome  Awesome to hear that you guys had a good time and evening  Happy new year    It is easy to lose sight of things  especially one another  Just keep at it  Always choose her at the end of the night  Not a game  It's been a common problem for my relationship as well  He would come home and jump on his video games instead of spending time with me  We rarely get time out together since we have a 7 month old but the time we do get together makes a world of difference   Best of luck    Sending you guys tons of love for the new year  I hope it's good to you   You know you're great  and you know you're deserving of love so test it and stop wasting your time  I recently read  don't recall source  that one strategy is to throw a handful of treats in the direction of the approaching dog  to distract them while you do a U turn  I haven't yet tried this   Another thought might be to carry a miniature air horn in case things do escalate  I've heard this can sometimes break up a fight  but wonder if it might make the situation more traumatic for my already reactive dog   I live in a tight urban area where off leash dogs are becoming a huge trend  despite our leash laws  I've currently been diverting or blocking to avoid eye contact between the dogs  I have no reservations about using citronella or pepper spray if myself or my dog is in danger  but I worry about all three of us getting hit w  it  or rage from the other owner  Can confirm I love Jackson Browne  He says exactly how I feel in his music  Weird   Make adult decisions  Suffer adult consequences  This isn't a game  If he doesn't do something that sacrifices his time  sleep  and sanity he will end up a poor loser that's a drain on everyone around him  In short he would be fucked  It's totally doable  But he isn't giving the vibe that he gets the gravity of his situation  But I'm not surprised  He's 17  He's naive  He's charting new territory so of course he's leaning on his parents   Are you doing OK  I'm good at chatting and telling shitty jokes  I've been there and I want you to feel OK about the next year    Then you must keep searching for that random thing that helps you out  For me  it was cooking  http   www battlesports ca rage room    You're welcome   I'm also good looking  but very small endowed Happy New Year everyone  You're right  My brother got a horrible girl pregnant and now he's going through hell  We used to have fun together but ever since this bitch ruined his life he hasn't been the same  I meant to put this under her hahahaha  If you are thinking  as per bronson  that the person is whatever he is bcoz of they way he was raised then read about steve jobs  The greatest entrepreneur  He was abandoned by his biological parents  He used walk miles to iscon temple so that he could have a nice one time meal  U can read more about him but the point is  it is possible to overcome the past experiences  We are the people  yes me too  And ur story reflects mine as well  who have to concure the past which many might not have experienced  We r not kids who were raised by reasonable understanding parents  I am glad that u are able think this in small age of 15   There are a few things you can do  if you have a friend that works at one of those places and they are a good employee  have them talk to a manager and they can tell a manager that you applied there  second you can try calling wherever you want to work and ask them if they got your application  this will increase your chance of being hired since it'll show that you actually want to work and it'll make them see your application  Good luck   "You wouldn't be on this subreddit if you didn't feel that there was something wrong in being alone"  Well that's not true haha Good advice  Keep it short and regular  Long workouts will bore you  Nope no one will like an broken mess self improvement may make yourself better and likeable but telling someone who obviously isn't in a good place people will like you for you just like that seems a bit shitty  She sounds depressed because she feels like she has to hide who she truly is from her loved ones  Especially you  you're apparently the person she loves most  yes  Imagine feeling like you had to hide yourself from the person you love most because you felt like they wouldn't love the real you   I think you need to be unconditionally loving and open minded and accepting towards her and I'll bet you her life does a 180  Show her you love and accept her and that you support her regardless of her orientation  When you do this she will get better  No  it's actually what I and many other people here actually experience daily  We've "put ourselves out there" and have been rejected every step of the way  We've been trying for years whether you want to believe it or not and have failed every single time  We haven't seen any results  only failure  And yes people aren't made to die alone  that's why it sucks to be alone  But that also doesn't guarantee that you'll ever find someone  People do die completely alone  It happens   We're on this sub because it's literally the only place in our lives where we can vent so we don't go insane by holding everything in    I'm really curious to know why exactly you just blatantly ignore the fact that most people here have done nothing but try for years and have still failed repeatedly  Why is that so hard for you to understand  Who is the real her though      the stress of not getting any is far  far less than the stress of getting a girl pregnant  If that's the case  then why the fuck is Tinder such a successful app  Are so many people willingly subjecting themselves to this traumatic stress  Why are you even bothering with sex if it ails your mind so much     If you're willing to take it  but on the fence  I'd take the offer with its pay  but not hours  to your current management  See if they want to keep you or not   Experience  To not see 2018  I'm so sorry you've had such a rotten year  It will get better  My first year of college was very similar to yours only I spent  5k on the boy who landed in a psych ward himself and I got pregnant  However  if I can recover  you can recover  too    Baby steps  Keep breathing  The human brain isn't fully developed until at least 26 and the judgement center is the last to finish up  When I found that out  I forgave myself for a lot of stuff  So keep moving and trying and it will get better  HUGS That's a really productive goal man  I'm going to start setting nutritional goals based on health instead of body composition  Good luck  Ya I wish there was a zombie apocalypse so Ellie could be my gf Both hemp and fish oil are primarily unsaturated fats   Meaning they have several double or triple bonds between carbon atoms  which can easily bond with oxygen atoms   All unsaturated fats are susceptible spoiling rancidity     Saturated fats are less susceptible to spoiling or going rancid as there are no double bonds between carbon atoms   WOOO get it bro  this can open doors for you  Floridian here  bust your butt  get that AA with a 4 0  I believe in you  It'll be hard but you can do it   And you should be able to transfer to any college    Also for the record UF   FSU in every educational aspect  And our grads have higher average salaries   Yeah I hope I win the lottery would be pretty crazy other than that no thanks I can live without world war 3 or some new super disease  Sounds to me you want a zombie acopalypse to happen I can get why you would find some parts appealing but I doubt you would press a button that would make it happen if you had one  because the amount of death and suffering would not be worth it  Also most pets would die do you want to live in a world without puppers and doggo's  And internet what about dank memes man  Have you talked to your academic advisor  If not  I cannot recommend doing so more  This is the exact stuff they deal with  Trust me on this  the older you get the less you care about people's respect on the internet  Why the hell are people calling videogames vidya now  totally serious and curious here  You still can find someone to be with  if you are willing to compromise   play more video games  I'm sorry dude   I drove my car into a ditch at exactly midnight tonight and didn't do shit for fun so stuff happens    I can tell you that I stopped caring about holidays for the last few years and it feels amazing    It's just another day when you've had enough heartaches   I lost one of my best friends over growing apart amongst other things    It  happens to everyone when they get older  I'm in my 30s  but most people get content with what they've got   I spent Christmas nursing a hangover and opening an awesome present from my reddit secret santa   And it was great    Also my car was fine after driving into that ditch tonight but the police were awesome and it made my night that I was so lucky      I'm hanging out with a friend next week who has a new kid and feels lonely too so we'll be there for each other   Just need to stay close to the people that matter    Idk why you got downvoted for that I upvoted again hope you keep this energy trough 2017    LMFAO  thats what brought me here  Looked at my phone and started feeling depressed but coming to this sub always cheers me up  Big XOXOs Op  Do what I did  eat chips and watch Bob Ross make paintings     I'm great at making detailed plans  but not so great at the action thing      Hi OP  just wanted to comment and say I really resonate with your post and particularly this comment    I made a really similar post a few weeks back asking for some advice on 'self love'  I haven't delved into all of the suggestions  many are books I don't have time for at the moment   but maybe you'll find some useful things there   1 6  You're a fucking idiot   Find someone who appreciates my audio engineering skills  In other words  get some clients  People say "do what you like and not worry what others think" regarding my music which is baloney because I have to impress someone to score a gig  You don't have to hug  If she's the kind of person who's like one it could be a good idea  but if you don't know then that means it's too early for a hug anyways  In the future you might need to warm the butter before using your eggbeater on it  It might have broke it indeed  The mature thing to do here would be to sit your parents down  gently point out some issues  and say that this is why they should go to marriage counseling  They got married for a reason at some point  maybe they've just lost their way  You obviously care for your parents  so help them through this  That's a good idea   Thank you  My part of wales is towns and villages and I have a car so I think for me putting the county is better  I wish you both the best of luck as well  Even if things may never be perfect for us  all we can do is live with a mindful purpose and just "keep on keepin' on"  Happy New Year       I read it and still don't get it  I didn't know either  but apparently it started on 4chan   http   knowyourmeme com memes vidya you don't deserve anything at all It's a cliche answer but  I plan to make working out a regular thing  The most I stuck to it last year was around a month and I only have a year or so to get in shape before I enlist  So aside that and continuing my education that's my primary goal   My "work" is basically just sitting at a desk  listening to music  watching videos  browsing posting on reddit  etc   so I don't mind  I work tech support in a call center on the night shift where calls are exceedingly rare  I enjoy what I do  so the calls don't even really bother me  but the vast majority of my shift is spent doing what I'd do anyway  So when I'm at home  I play games on PC or console  and at work  I just do internet stuff  Getting paid to do this is pretty amazing  I'm not rolling in cash  but I get enough to live comfortably  "Period" is another method of birth control  although it severely limits how many times a month you can do your thing  The hemp and flax seed oils I get  are locally produced and refrigerated during transport and at retail    I feel this is safer   Fish oils can't be used for eating  and taste like shit as pills   I think I will stick with the liquid versions I currently use   I like the science behind what you are saying  even though I don't understand it   The CBC marketplace that exposed many brands of fish oil to be rancid at sale permanently turned me off of fish based oils  that would make sense  You're not stupid  you just don't have a lot of experience  You just didn't think about other options because you were in a new situation and you were nervous  These things take exposure and practice sometimes  Next time you'll know  There has to be something we can come up with   What if there was a social media group  maybe a private one  where we could say we are sat in x coffee shop and post it when we are there       I don't know  I am just throwing up ideas at the moment  Wait does the message essentially boil down to accepting failure and faith  Because if that's the case I think I got it  Also what's livejournal  She has to show you  The person she hides from you is the real her  Find my purpose in life I actually was debating picking up FFXIV recently  but I don't really want to pay for a subscription  I also already own Black Desert so that's my MMO fix for the most part  On top of owning Destiny  But I'm down   Here's my realistic goals resolutions  Get in shape  Continue practicing guitar and become proficient at it  get treatment for my SA  Just those three  I think I can achieve these three by summer time   Good luck to you with your education  Where do you want to transfer to  what's your major   I'm going to set a reminder for 6 mo and ask yall how your all doing with your resolutions   RemindMe  6 months The sub is pretty cheap like 12 99 and you get 30 days free  And I think I saw the base game  not HW  for like  10 on Amazon   I have BDO as well but I can't get over how restrictive it is D  What's your PSN  I initially left a comment saying I really resonated with your post  and didn't think I had anything more to contribute other than linking to another post I made earlier asking for similar advice    But I just remembered some things and for what it's worth I thought I'd share    maybe it could help   First  one of my counsellors told me that a history of negative self talk is incredibly difficult to get out of  because it's your brain's go to way of processing responding to the world    Developing positive thoughts is literally something that you need to train your brain to be able to do  She encouraged me to start small and try to focus on a few things I could tell myself that I genuinely believed which would help me feel better in that moment  I was extremely frustrated upset with myself because I thought I had gotten over my anxiety  but she said encouraged I take 'baby steps' and acknowledged that it is a long  long process that won't be fixed in a day  These little positive statements are similar to CBT but not as onerous  Although generally it would be great to practise challenging your thoughts and respond in a way that kindly questions whether what you think is true and or helpful    I also recently discovered this subreddit and I'm trying to really internalize the positivity and love in these posts  https   www reddit com r wholesomememes   Know that you are worthy OP  You are not your past  The fact that you're posting this means you have the self awareness that many people don't to acknowledge you may have hurt people  but want to be better and do better  Take pride in this    After reading your post another few times  I also wonder if it would help for you to write a letter or email or post to these people you feel you've wronged  You don't have to send it  but it sounds like you have a lot of guilt resentment that maybe you could let out    Even if it's a "Hi       I know it's been years since we talked but I have been doing some reflection lately and I feel terrible about X  I was hurt  but I shouldn't have done what I did  I'm so sorry "   There's a chance that if you do send it  the person may not accept this apology  so maybe be prepared for this  But you are not your past  and every day is a new day  and this is a new year    Wishing you well OP  Also leaving this quote to remind you  as well as myself to be hopeful for the future    "Just because the past didn't turn out as you hoped doesn't mean your future can't be better than you ever imagined "      My mom AND dad both wished me happy new year  go me  Getting a high GPA in high school is like medaling in the Special Olympics  Sure it "counts" but there's bigger leagues   Yeah  it's like 30 days and you can level all classes to 20 IIRC   In addition Stormblood is coming out next summer so you get caught up by then  This is what scares me about the internet  you can have these awesome friendships with some cool people  and then all of a sudden they're all gone and you have nothing No  I just said that because that sub is filled with toxic people so frequenting that sub won't help in any way  and if you're there people can assume your one of the toxic people and lash out  Also I never said or implied you deserve bullying for the actions of others but maybe the reason people don't respond positively to your posts or comments because you seem hostile like saying fuck you for no reason   To finally not be a pussy and kill myself Yeah  I didn't get one message either  Of course it was 4chan haha wtf thanks for giving a link I apreciate it  I sold my old PS3 with all of my games  and bought a PS4 on Black Friday  Maybe it sounds miserably but it's really important to me  because video games help me not fall into depression  Some of us just have crippling depression    I actually already have HW from an old Humble Bundle so that's set and my PSN is Munishin   Hello  I see that your relation with your mother wasn't the best either  I'm sorry to hear that and thanks for your help  If you don't mind the question  did you decide back then to go to the tech school  I want to attend another school too  I don't like what I'm studying and I'm afraid it would be too late now to change schools  But also my parents chose that for me  so I should be grateful and appreciate it  or not  I don't know  I'm feeling guilty to admit I don't like what they did for me  I mentioned those living conditions so that I can compare it to others'  to the people that don't have those and their problems are real  mine are not  I'm just complaining  I would like to contribute to the society with all I can  but I can't solve everything  then I'm feeling guilty  I will check out the book you mentioned  I know our problems aren't the same so I will instead read it rationally  I hope you're doing well  have a good day  I wish I could be a neet  Hello internet stranger and happy new year  I'm very glad that you are now willing to seek professional help  It's a big step to take but it's a step that makes all the difference  Sometimes  when we're stressed out or facing depression  our opinions and view of the world gets clouded and warped  A therapist will help you clear up that cloudiness and help develop the tools to flourish    If you ever need a friend or just someone to talk to  feel free to DM me  I've been in similar shoes  and heck  am still facing mental health battles of my own   maybe we can help each other  Besides  I always like talking to new people     Yeah I assumed that hence why I said non incel's may lash out there because allot of people there are toxic  with all the worshipping the elliot guy thinking we should have acces to pure young children for sex stuff and let's not forget the sex slaves lol  Why not just be in this sub  they are pretty similar in purpose but it's less toxic here   Hey  I know this might sound like a stupid and random question but were you the group of guys and girls at the Jarry metro station at approx  1 am headed towards Cote Vertu  Sorry I couldn't finish in the post it said the purchase was official but I checked my bank info and it charged me for the 3 failed purchases  And remember  in the grim dark future there is only war  I was basically the same  very little social skills  rarely got out of the house    And one day  I decided to take up a sport  So I chose longboarding  and decided that I'd also overhaul the rest of my life in the process  I got involved in a lot of Facebook groups  started getting out and going to group rides in the city  Soon after I started talking to some of them a bit more  asking to learn the more difficult part of longboarding  sliding   I started hanging out more and more  and made a ton of amazing friends  Now I've got highly improved social skills  relative to the initial 0   great friends that I love and a sport I never get tired of    Try something new  Get involved in a community  You'll see how quickly you make friends who you share an interest with   Good luck  I understand it's your house and you feel she should take her responsibilities seriously  But you can't drive her to do them cuz from what I understood she's extremely adamant  What I suggest is you stop taking any sort of initiative to help her out  She's gonna be a crybaby about it  no doubt but eventually she will have to do what ever is required from her  Be extremely rude and tell her that you'll kick her out if she doesn't do her duties  It might be her room  her laundry but it's your house and your life she's disturbing  Give her and ultimatum and do not let her take you in a light way  I think it's high time you stop letting her ruin your family life  She must understand your priorities are different after marriage because you have a new family and son to look after  You can always tell your mom to take her back in  No 20 yo is a responsibility of someone else except themselves  I wouldn't think so based on your description  Sometimes we get stuck in parties we don't fit into  Don't blame yourself  It was an awkward situation  give yourself permission to feel weird  and move on to tomorrow  I don't think there's much to be learned ruminating on this  Sounds good  You're very lucky  3 Update   50  fluent and it's not even inauguration yet   I hope to be out by mid year at latest  Don't focus on the long term  Make a schedule for yourself and focus on your goals one day at a time  Most of school is about jumping through hoops  If you jump through all the hoops and do a generally good job  you will meet the minimum GPA  There is no point in focusing on the big picture if you cannot handle the day to day routine  Break it down and focus on the daily work load  Obviously this is different for different people  but I'll give you my view of adult life after highschool  I'm 21 now    You don't have 'bffs' in the adult world  'adult world' being that time when you get sick of partying hard every weekend   Your friends consist of people who you can visit at their place and have a nice dinner and talk about interesting current events  or perhaps go out to a bar and have a couple of drinks  Your definition of a 'friend' changes  I have plenty of friends that I never see outside of university and work  and I couldn't tell you where most lived  I couldn't tell you what their favourite colour is  or when their birthday is  or their middle name  or how many siblings they have  Half of the time  I forget how old they are  From my admittedly limited experience  being incredibly close with any one person always leads to drama and falling outs and petty fights  and most adults are simply too busy and too tired to deal with all of that    But I enjoy spending part of my day with each of my friends  and that's all that matters  I'm not going to mentally rank them according to how much they mean to me or anything  As for trust  I wouldn't trust anyone with really sensitive information as everyone is a gossip in some sense  and I wouldn't want to give my friends that temptation    So  no  you're never going to find your 'perfect best friend'  but neither does anyone else  Life doesn't get easier after highschool  as highschool is one of the easiest times in your life  After you turn 18  or 21 depending on your country   you have to take full control of your own life and accept the consequences for any choices you make  There is no one to teach you how to fill out the forms properly  and there are serious ramifications and no second chances if you get it wrong  But life is  better  after highschool  Freedom of movement and larger social circles mean that you'll never be stuck with any one group of people  If you don't like your friends  you just find new ones  If you can't find any new ones  you just move or you suck it up   Take this for whatever it's worth    I used to have a mentor when I was younger  and I'd say similar things to him    His response   "Ask her to get a sandwich with you "  Granted  he's considerably older than me  so that exact phrasing might be a little dated  but the idea and thought cuts through all the overthinking that I typically spin my wheels on    Asking someone to share a meal with you is pretty low risk  low chance of rejection  and sets the stage for progressing if it's something the two of you are both interested in   If she's into someone else  she may just say no to make her situation clear to you  in which case  you have your answer and you don't look like a goon   Also  it's just a thing people who are good at being sociable would do   I'm bad at that  so I had to be told this    You haven't made clear what your current level of familiarity is with this person  so you might be past this stage  but if not  maybe that helps put things into perspective   Edit  I think what my mentor was suggesting was literally "hey let's go grab something to eat sometime"  not "hey I'd like to orchestrate an elaborate courtship outing involving dinner at a nice restaurant"  Lol why      take him a blanket and go the hell to bed  You tried  I'll add you in a bit  Well see now i'm just confused you want a relationship yet hate all women  and I kinda agree with the bluepill sentiment but your simply not going to find allot of confident men here since this a sub about being unable to find a relationship  If you just want sex but don't wan't to wait why not go to a prostitute  Hang in there  Cliche as it sounds  it's a new year and there's always chance for a new start  or to change  Always here to talk  stay safe and a very happy new years to you     Read your syllabus  attendance and class participation are likely part of your grade  Australian woman here  Don't move to Australia with him unless you're 100  positive you and him are rock solid  I know plenty of young women here who moved across the world to be with the Australian man they fell in love with  And many of them have gone on to have a child only to have the relationship fall apart  You will be stranded in Australia with no support and unable to leave the country to return home with your child  I'm not saying all relationships have ended like this  but I live in a very multicultural part of Sydney  and meet many foreign woman  particularly Europeans and South American  in this situation and they are miserable   He is a waste of time honey  Don't bother  All the best x At least your character is strong  I'm only level 85 in bloodborne  last night tried dueling like 8 times and lost all of them  everyone has these overpowered DLC weapons and advanced yolo swag bloodknightvampirebeastmage builds  And here I am  Keemstar4997  who knows two things  hit fast with R1 or hit slow but big with R2  Neither of them is paying out so far  If you handed in work late  there are penalties applied to your final grade  Some professors will impose a limit but mark you normally otherwise  so an assignment that is a day late can only get a maximum of 80   even if it's perfect  Others just scale you down and take off points  so you might lose 10  from your final grade  regardless of what grade you got  Unless you've already taken that into account with your calculations  probably just accept your grade   Prevention is a hell of a lot different than treatment   Studying people who are already diseased isn't a fool proof way to say "this does nothing"   Drugs will help but it's important to be highly aware of addiction and dependence   That's a shitty situation you're in friend  Im sorry for the stress she's put you through  Do you mind if I ask how old is your sis and the girl in question   I have never dealt with your exact situation but it's just a more recent flavor of rebellious teen sounds like  They think they know everything and everything their parents say is wrong  the girl probably acts out at home as well  either that or their parents view themselves as "progressive" and let her do whatever she wants  I e  walk all over them     To be honest  there's a hair thin line that you have to walk with your sister that's somewhere between "this girl is bad for you  we don't want you hanging out with her because we care" and "we accept you for who you are and we just want you to be happy"   It's essentially letting her figure it out on her own but giving her just enough guidance to not get herself in trouble        This may not help much but the best of luck to you and the most important thing is that you stay strong and try not to explode from the ignorance  I've found them all to be unbearably boring and repetitive and just a massive waste of time  My brother played Archeage for a while and it was painful thinking about how someone could spend their time monotonously grinding for  nothing    I agree entirely  But you almost have to go out of your way to do that poorly   It is good to have the feedback   Thank you for replying   In a lot of cases I guess we probably wont like the other person   But then just a smile and a little "Hi" from someone like ourselves would brighten our day I think  and make some of us feel a little less alone and isolated   It could be the tiny little spark that brings two people together next time their paths cross  Making friends as an adult gets harder I'm sorry to say  You may make some acquaintances at work but it's ill advised to make much more at work  as the saying goes don't mix business with pleasure and there are very good reasons for that      In highschool you're forced to hang around lots of people  this makes making friends much easier  Likewise in highschool you can't get fired and your livelihood doesn't depend on it  That doesn't exist in adulthood  you have to actively seek friendships in adulthood         There are no perfect scenarios in life  Instead of focusing on a perfect ideal of what people should be and trying to squeeze real people into that  just find people you get along with and go from there  Perhaps your problem is that you've found yourself attached to the wrong friend group   Contact xbox support and tell them what happened  they should be able to credit you or return the money back  I definitely understand where you're coming from and I'm going through a bit of a similar situation as well at the moment   While I really don't want to be mean and even though I know you had the best intentions  I can tell you that what you did was only for you   I'm not calling you a bad person or anything  but it's just the truth   What happened is that she decided that she didn't want to talk to you anymore  and going no contact probably helped her to move on   When you contacted her it brought up a lot of feelings that she likely wanted to forget or had moved on from  and she just didn't want to go through it again   Again  I have to say that doing what you did doesn't make you a bad person because you genuinely wanted to be positive and apologize  but unfortunately the best way to apologize and to help her is just to leave her alone   Best of luck though and happy new year  What does it mean when someone acts this way   i just dont rly get it  So sad to read this    I hope you get tested and treated very soon  Sending hugs    Nah  it's grinding for phat loot  Ionno  I prefer MMOs over everything else to each their own I guess  c    Your friends consist of people who you can visit at their place and have a nice dinner and talk about interesting current events  or perhaps go out to a bar and have a couple of drinks    I'm old enough to be your grandfather and this is completely wrong           Your definition of a 'friend' changes  I have plenty of friends that I never see outside of university and work  and I couldn't tell you where most lived       Those are acquaintances  not friends   Huh  27 for me  so I guess I can believe it  Try not to worry about it too much   It's very normal to feel bad and maybe even a little guilty as well  but you did the right thing   Just keep in mind that it would have been worse of you to string her along when you didn't really feel anything anymore   The only thing you can do now is to avoid making her life confusing  as in don't constantly call or text without the intention of getting back together  and wait it out   Time is really the only cure for these types of things   Best of luck and happy new year  I can't speak to Italy or American education overseas  but I do know this    Take all the biology and chemistry courses you can  All of them  At as high a level as you can  If you can take anatomy  even better  If there are any other courses that relate to medicine or that you can relate to a subspecialty of medicine that you care about  right now   E g studying psychology  sociology  or a foreign language  or even computer programming  then take that too  Also take statistics and learn Excel  which is good for anyone  Become a strong  self disciplined student   Then volunteer anywhere medical  Hospitals  clinics  blood drives  fundraisers  nursing homes  anywhere you can to both get a feel for the field and and network  Network  network  network  Getting even one recommendation from each place you go can help you apply a lot of places  Be wary though  you won't be the only kid doing so and the field is infamous for big egos  bad manners  and hyper competition  Toughen your skin   Then do any projects you can related to medicine  Tinker with low grade medical tech  see if you can put together a small study of something  get an EMT or equivalent license  and so on  Basically put yourself in the mindset that you are already in medicine  practicing medicine at the level you are qualified to  and working through to practice at higher levels  This is your life 24 7  enjoy it and don't lose frame   And then start working on applications  Sell yourself as an existing asset to the medical community looking to advance  not some kid who just wants to be a doctor  And be prepared to still be told no because the competition really is that tough   And then when you do go somewhere there is a whole new world I am not qualified to speak for   Good luck   Whenever you see each other you both say that you are going to hang out but  you both know that you never will There's a ton of medication for it depending on your diagnoses   I was expecting at least one guy who I'm friends with to send me a Happy New Years  but apparently he's not in town   and I'm afraid to think what he did on New Year's Eve     Sounds good   For friends from college they're pretty much people in my club that I have a bunch of classes with  I'd consider a good amount of these friends to be good friends  It's a big group so it's hard to be friends with everyone   Most of my other friends are from high school  like 4 6 or so  or previous places I've worked  I consider all of these people good friends  We've only stayed in contact for so long because we're all pretty good friends now   The only surefire way to make friends is to find a thing your interested in and join a club or something that does it  For us it's a club focused on computers and programming  For you it could be anything  There's a club for tons of stuff you're bound to meet people you get along with   Work is more hit or miss for making friends  And then usually they're just work friends  not invite them over to hang out friends  I really liked bad Ben  It's on amazon prime Please don't hurt yourself in any way and if it's getting serious please consider the hotline in the sidebar or a therapist    Keep in mind that the whole new year new me thing is just something that people say when they don't really know what they want to change in the new year   Think instead of new year better me   Try to think about some aspects of your life that you want to change or improve   They can be general as long as you make specific goals to target them  both big and small   When you start reaching them you'll feel better and better   Best of luck and feel free to pm me any time if you need to talk  Nah I don't think he has APD  Hey man  I was in the EXACT same boat as you     I had exactly ONE friend from high school  and he was my best friend because he was my ONLY friend  Anyone else who was "friends" with me either didn't get close with me  or only used me to get help for projects    I didn't have real friends in high school  I'm in my first year of university  where I met people with the same interests as me  didn't have that in school   and I could easily make a group of friends    It's been 4 months since I made these new friends and now I know that I could trust these people with my life   Hang in there man  you're only in high school  Even if you don't end up making many friends in university  you'll be able to at least make 1 REAL friend  and that's what matters the most   My one friend in high school is still one of my best friends  and he helped me get through high school    But just because I had one friend didn't mean the end of the world for me  I knew that I had to get out of high school  because I wouldn't find the right friends here   I just kept my hopes up for university  and it worked   If you need to talk more  I'm here  PM me whenever    I'm actually having a really hard time tonight  new years  so it was nice to read that  My SO and I are having a hard time because we're long distance and ready to move in together  but it's not easy to make that transition  I've been on the verge of tears all night     And I've been feeling super clingy towards him but resisting it as much as I can  Hah  That was good   You drank    and it was not safe to drive     Do they have family close by that you could reach out to  You could also contact a suicide hotline and ask for help on the subject  thanks a lot  I can see her getting more defensive if I approach this in a confrontational way    I'll take balance as the key word here     Money is awesome  It allows you to eat better food  take frequent nicer vacations  live in a nicer area  not worry about bills etc  Pretty much everything in life outside of relationships and health are impacted by how much money you have  I have a great life outside of being FA and I wouldn't feel this way if I was struggling financially  Call the bank  Hence my disclaimer "Obviously this is different for different people  but I'll give you my view   "  It's my definition of a friend  and it has never changed  I have never invited anyone over to my house  even as a child  so maybe my view of friends is a little different   good job  I'm so sorry and I understand completely how you feel   Going off of what you said in another comment though  remember that it's only been four days   Give yourself time to be sad and remember that it's a natural part of the healing process   You won't be getting any better if you're hiding how you're feeling and lying to yourself   Speaking from experience  be happy that he removed you from Facebook   It seems like a cruel thing to do but trust me in saying that you don't want to be seeing what he's doing anytime soon   Try to also delete ways to contact him and this is the most important thing   Delete his snapchat and phone number now  along with pictures or anything else that will remind you of him and hurt you   Doing this right away will help you very much   I completely get your situation and how hard it is  so again I'll say that it's ok to be sad   Remember though do not contact him or anything of the sort   Try to detach as much as possible so that you can heal   Best of luck   Stay strong and pm me if you ever want to talk about it or vent   I know exactly what you're going through and it's the worst feeling in the world  but I promise you'll get through this  I would accept it and leave  Dude gave you so much leniency and even when you skip class and crap and hand stuff late and shit  You can be nerd  emo  punk  introvert  extrovert  anything you want  people doesn't really care  If you are attractive  chicks will love you  If you are not  they won't  I played Dota 2 for a long time  got to know a lot of people who had high ranks and literally played all day all night  despite being like 22 24  I always imagined them as spotty fat virgins  until a Dota 2 group for my country was started on facebook  I got invited and saw many of my long time online friends  Boy  I was wrong  80  of them were normies  with pretty girlfriends  One of the biggest nerds in our group  who even joined to an official hungarian team and played tournaments for real money looks like a badass viking  with tall  ripped body and with godlike beard  He always showed us pictures of him with his new girlfriends  they looked like fucking models       Just imagine  if you would attend to paid tournaments of some video game  and practice all day all night  what would girls  or anyone  think about you  You would be a pathetic sad loser  who still plays stupid video games at the age of 25  But apparently  if you are attractive  you would be "cute" and "aaahhh  such a nerd  3"  If they use social media like Facebook you can report them and facebook will dispatch the police EMT I think    Facebook suicide report  https   m facebook com help contact 305410456169423    Other than that the best thing you could do is ask if they want to talk on the phone and call them and assess how far they are in planning    suicide guidance checklist   http   www suicide org how to help a suicidal person html  is a good resource on what to say     The best option is to get them to call the suicide prevention hotline 1 800 273 8255  even if they are just super depressed they will have a judgement free resource to talk to that will help them cope     I hope everything works out   Just try and be as compassionate and caring as possible and reassure the person that you are there for them while trying to get them more qualified help  Honestly just focus on school and get that 4 0 then worry about where to go later  Colleges don't matter  Your degree and knowledge and shown skills do   When you have that 4 0 colleges and universities will be trying to suck your dick for you to get in   Also because you might change majors or coursework ideas etc  Best wishes  Happy new year  Happy New Year   Hope I die this year  What do you need help for  Oh   yep  I can relate to this  "That after college  you don't really make many new friends and life is mostly lonely "  I'm sure people saying this have not graduated from college and have no first hand experience  Sure it might  seem  to them that people live boring lives because their lives aren't constant partying as a 20 something  but this is not the real case for the people they are walking about   Life is what you make of it  One should not to put blame on something else if he she feels lonely or feels like life is not fulfilling the expectations    It is what it is  Another night at bar   but for a purpose   New Years Eve  I saw friends which was ok  But now I'm home  drunk  4 30am  sad  New year resolution   stop going to bars  I know  I get nothing  Not even a kiss on new years   '  It's 4 30am  I'm home now  drunk  sad  You should continue to look elsewhere and assume the job with him won't happen but check at the end of the month  That's when he said he would know more  I think you already let him know you're interested and it is important to follow up  but I don't think you will gain anything by asking sooner   You are gay too  Can you provide links for those claims  "Proven to cause long term brain damage" is a serious statement  Thank you    resolutions are for people who lack initiative  Me Yeah Put a letter in their mail saying   Picture "this hose that you usually use to water your plants draws from our water bill  We do not want that  If you do not fix this issue within a week we will cut the hose off  literally  "   As a teen she isn't going to rebel  just is and you have to understand this inside of that context  This isn't really something for a sister to deal with unfortunately  this is where your parents need to just cut her off from this girl and accept she's going to be mad about that for a time       For your part  perhaps the only thing you can realistically do is try to explain to her after your parents cut her off  that this girl has a lot of emotional problems that your sister doesn't want to get mixed up in and you think your parents cut her off out of love for your sister and the desire to see her succeed   It's so much work that I understood very early that very few people would stick around long enough to discover it    So I got a 6 pack and at least some women loved me  It was for my abs but I still had more people loving me   I don't think the blood room is a good advice    You're young you have time to learn emotions  Your parents seem to be the extra worried type  is it true   Look on Google about assertiveness  it might help Those are acquaintances  Perhaps you've never had friends   I'm not in engineering  but I am in physics which encourages a similar style of thinking    We learn to think logically  critically  and in an efficient manner because we have no other option  We're given questions to solve that are difficult  intricate  and confusing  and getting it wrong is not an option  Those who are not capable of taking all that they have been taught and reading up on the things they have not  or are unable to apply all of that  will fail and drop out  In some senses  I think it's a self selection process so I'm not sure how successful you'd be at improving at logical thinking if you're not predisposed towards it  Only the physicists who are already logically minded  or who can learn quickly  will get through to graduation  But there is certainly something about realizing that you're going to spend the next 3 7  depending on if you go for a PhD  years of your life having to solve those problems  that makes you work to streamline the whole problem solving process   Same  kinda have to stick around due to family  Hopefully random chance takes care of it for me  You're right about the work being hit or miss   the few jobs I've had I'm only close with a few of my coworkers  Good to hear you've made some good friends in college  looking forward to that myself  Yep  it's 10 30 am now and zero message    And say that they were all saying we were friends  Some of them told me that a few days ago   But there is always this feeling of "maybe they are waiting for ME to send them a message   and if I don't they will think I don't care about them and I don't want them in my life"  Sadly  Most girls already have someone  And if the girl is alone    Most likely dating someone  EVERYONE DOES  BUT WOMEN NEED LOVE TO GIVE LOVE NOT HATE  It's not stooping low if you just enjoy yourself plenty of people do it and it might make you happier   Also I am far from a "normie" but in this case ill take it as a compliment    Computers    imo take a big self built tower at home and a minimal laptop  Hope it goes well OP  I really wish it goes smoothly and your parents understand  D I am bi myself so it makes sense of all of the stresses  but just let yourself be free  Currently trying to keep my hopes up too  I only have like 5 months left so that's not too bad  Thanks for the encouragement  looking forward to finally leaving high school behind and moving forward  Same for me    Life is going on  uneventful  That's certainly true  But I game as well  mostly on Xbox one  and I've met a couple girls who do as well  It is possible No girl is going to find me attractive just because of my clothes  or because I'm funny  Most girls date based on looks entirely  especially in high school and university  Not like it's a bad thing  I'm not bashing them  they have every right to do it  It's just a simple fact  Let's agree to disagree Absolutely disgusting  Long headaches and constant drowsy feeling   I'm in a highly introverted and isolated field of study  so it's the norm amongst my colleagues and peers at least  Different people have different expectations for their friends  we don't all have to be the same  22 Here  guess I'm still a rookie      I really needed this today    Could have done without the crying  but they were happy tears and I will not be ashamed of looking like a blubbering child right now   Great job  So much people keep others in their life because it's easy and familiar  It takes guts to remove someone from your life   At times  its best to let things break for people to truly appreciate their true value  What I would do for your sis if I was in your shoes is to ensure that when things fall apart  the lesson is leant with minimal damage as any other solution I can think of will be a short term solution as the same mindset would still be in place that met her to fall under that girl's influence  Just minimise the emotional and mental damage and let consequence teach the lesson   I don't know honestly  If she sends you nudes just like that  before you guys even met  that is a huge red flag in my opinion  Are you sure she wasn't fake   I'm not unattractive nor obese so in theory I should be able to obtain a reasonably attractive GF  but my skills are below par  When I search dating sites the girls I click on lead me to realize "these girls will get hundreds of messages and will have plenty of suitors who are either more attractive or wealthier than myself"  I'd like to think I have reasonable physical standards but at 34 I want someone who doesn't have kids  doesn't want any new kids  and is financially responsible  These traits are difficult to find  I actually kind of liked FF  It was the first MMO I've ever played  I quit playing it for a while but I've been thinking about getting back into it  The downside is that it tends to pull away hours at a time  Hi Vix  I'm 20  this is kind of an alt account and I don't want to share the country I'm from  I'm sorry  Also I feel that would influence maybe the replies  not only on this sub   You seem to have a lot of hobbies and your days surely aren't boring  it was just so uplifting to read what you wrote  I think even though as you said you're the opposite of me  there is something we seem to have in common  but somewhere the whole theory splits  I want to find that point   ''You only get one life  so make the best of it ''   And I think I took it too seriously  I don't know what makes me an asshole person that's opinion is to be part of everything  be everywhere and do only good deeds  I want people to notice me  to be a hero  and as I have only one life I must work all day and all night to save as many as I can  All my other problems in life are secondary  inferior  I only care about this  I only want this part of me to disappear  or to be solved  I feel way too bad for being so egoistic  Whenever I made those rewards for myself too  I had the feeling that I didn't deserve it  or rather there should be no reward at all  only work and work  and then my death will pay for it sometime    ''A person can't be productive 100  of the time  or they would become bitter and sad  Or they would feel guilty and empty inside ''   What if someone's that disappointed that they don't mind being sad and guilty  because they feel it's their ''job'' and they need to carry on doing it whatever it takes and whatever else they will miss out in life  and they shouldn't complain  This is what I'm feeling  I can't relax or schedule 1 hour of video games for example anymore  I'm now home from the college and I haven't had any good moments since it started  one day I said  screw school  my job  and everyone in the world  I'm going to read and play games all day  cook what I want  dress how I want  call up my friends  listen to music  I especially love the piano  it always makes me cry in joy  This happened I guess about four days ago  then I decided to write this post because I felt incredibly childish  irresponsible and guilty of that day  and I wasted it on doing nothing  The fact that I'm feeling guilty and deep down I want to have fun in life  that makes me guilty too  and it goes round and round   I promise I will try  or find exactly what I need to try  what I have to do to stop this  I want to thank you for your help  and have a happy new year    Unfortunately  that means you don't mean as much to him as he means to you  for lack of subtler phrasing  which is incredibly sad  From the sounds of it  you deserve someone a lot better  Trust me  there will be people who will make you laugh like he does  that you know you can trust  Go catch em  girl     Lol  I love it   I think that people who can easily find a new partner are less likely to give 100  to their current partner  Human nature  sadly  A lot of people

is hard to prove  studies are still run and we need bigger studies to have results  As these fields fail to get the big financements    The interest for Alzheimer the last years in Europe will surely

a day when enough is enough   Personally  I am a firm believer in not telling anybody  They own their life  and often suicide is a last resort in gaining some form of control  To go to the police or the family would almost certainly make the situation worse  as no amount of argument  forced restraint  or  most likely  lack of understanding from loved ones  which is most often what drives them to the position  will change their minds   What you need to do is step away and allow them the room to figure things out  If they're telling you  then they're far less likely to act upon their desires  You need to wait until they are back within a period of normality  and you need to bring it up with them  Talk with them as a friend  but do not push advice  and do not order  These actions will only make the situation worse   Hang out with them  have fun with them  make them feel like they're worth something indirectly  without ever pushing the topic  If you like RPG's try out Witcher 3  I just picked it up on PS4 and it's great  I wanna play Overwatch so badly but there's no sale on it in the PSN store and the full price for it feels a little too expensive  Go with a half truth half lie approach   You didn't know the punch had alcohol in it until after you'd already had a glass   You only drank one glass and it must not have been very strong  because it didn't taste that bad  But you wanted to err on the side of caution  and didn't want to risk driving afterwards   If they insist on trying to make a big deal about how alcohol got into the punch tell your parents that you're not going to get anyone in trouble  and you had hoped that you'd proven your judgement by getting a ride home  Tell them that will have to be enough for them   It's tough to take the "righteous anger" angle when you're lying your ass off  but if you can it's super effective  Wow  gay guy here  32  but I feel your pain  I'm sorry you've gone through all this      Great   I do the same    Don't feel sorry for sharing your passions  You'll always find people who will appreciate it even if they don't show up   And that's fine  but what makes an acquaintance verse what makes a friend are objective definitions  not subjective       I think it only becomes cheating when you feel the need to hide these things from your boyfriend so I don't think you cheated  I also think it's normal to like the attention   However  I think you should be careful because it sounds like you could find yourself in a position where you do end up cheating  Slippery slope and all     Gay guy here   but yes  it's all about looks   '  I need money for video games and computer hardware peripherals  I agree  I'm in the same situation  Quitting doesn't mean you gave up  It means you were aware of what was going on

That's a real twist a knife in your hearter  Chill  Keep a 2 second gap  don't rush junctions  be clear to other drivers what you're doing and give them space to figure out what they're doing   It may

think it's good advice and I lost nothing by giving it a shot  and it at least made me feel like the more reasonable person in the exchange  which is nice  I hope this works out for you also  It's

otherwise    I hang out with my friends when schedules permit  I go drinking with them  we have inside jokes  we go on trips together  I have helped them out when they needed it  and they have helped me in return  we give and receive advice between each other  I have had my friends cry on my shoulder and I have done the same to them  I would not hesitate to protect their name and I am sure they

100 and 15 7 hours a week  I drove from New York to Oklahoma in June  The big things for me were    Make sure you've eaten  When you're getting sleepy and you can't really pinpoint why  taking a break and getting some food in your system can be a great reset  Had to drive all night through Tennessee Arkansas  and taking a half hour stop and eating some Wendy's salad made the biggest difference in my mindset and energy levels    Keep yourself occupied  but not so much that you get distracted   I made up some awesome playlists for the daytime  and enjoyed comedians or books on tape for the evening   Don't make the mistake of finding a comedian so hilarious you almost swerve into the next lane laughing  it's scary     Use AirBnB if it's an option for you   This saved us a shit ton of money  honestly  I had someone with me  so I felt less weird about staying at another person's house  but you can often book an empty house apartment if you plan ahead    You can go 60 on the highway  Just stay in the right or middle lane  and as long as you're not blocking people it doesn't matter  It'll save you gas  and help you feel in control and not like you're rushing  because honestly going 10 20 faster doesn't make that much of a difference     Start planning now  and map out places you're interested in visiting  if you have any extra time  This will help you stay motivated and excited instead of nervous    If you're worried about budgeting  buy lots of chips  yogurt  and sandwich supplies and make yourself food instead of "eating out"  Try to avoid night driving  it's just shitty and stressful when you're first learning  Get enough sleep and wake up early   it's worth it   Don't be scared to get off the road if you feel uncomfortable  It's better to lose some time or have to make another plan than to get in an accident     I hope this all makes sense  I'm not 100  sober right now  but I know that if I save this I'll never come back  and I wanted to give you advice because I made almost this exact trip this summer    Anyway  best of luck  and I bet you can do this  I hope the drive goes well and you have some neat experiences along the way   Why didn't you go  I hope it is something that is easily fixable   But if not  i'll tell you what you will do   You will be okay   You will talk with your doctor  maybe get therapy  maybe try meds   Lots of other things can help  like meditation  diet changes  exercise  Depression and anxiety can get better and can even go away in some people     Best of luck to you  Why would you have bird flu just because you came in contact with a bird of some description  O o       You take the bird to a vet and go from there  Actually saving the bird is going to cost you money Thanks   I was honestly starting to think horrible things of myself just for liking the attention  Anyway I do not go to parties without my boyfriend anymore because I don't even want to spend time without him while I could spend some with him since I love him so much  You have rich fantasies  have you thought of wrighting novels   It can help because it is not just talking   It is focusing on thoughts and how they affect how you behave and how you feel   It is kind of like investigating a puzzle and then figuring out the best way to put it together  Call the local animal welfare charity and ask them for advice on how to take care of him    Side note   That  is the face    of a man who  truly  regrets his actions   Bite the bullet and admit you took the safest possible option considering the circumstances  Apologize for going against their wishes  as well  They're your parents and they likely won't believe any bullshit story your nervous 18 year old brain can come up with  You really need to stand your ground   I think just the fact that it's not your property  is enough to warrant it being a bad idea   I would reply with you thought you married an adult  rather than someone willing to make stupid decisions just for some fun    Obviously not  since your genes were passed on to you  You could contact the dojo and speak to them about this  they can give you advice   Or email them with questions   shut the duck up  What did the duck ever do to you  I'm really happy for you  Congrats on the year long relationship  heres hoping for many more with her  These are good questions for your doctor   If you don't have one  maybe go to a clinic and get a referral for a general practitioner   They can help you figure things out  maybe it is physical  maybe not  and refer you to a specialist if you need  Interesting how the worthless people can end up with a balanced and fulfilling life    It's like if putting bacteria count as your first measure of satisfaction was not a very good strategy   And how do you deal with all the bacteria in your guts  Quite disgusting really  I'm sorry about your situation  It's a very difficult one to navigate  The most important aspect in dealing with it  however  is rapport and being non judgmental  Being non judgmental doesn't mean letting her walk over you  though   How old is your sister  If she's at about high school age  gr 10 12   I think it's definitely possible to gain trust by having a friendly conversation about her views and also getting her to understand nuance better  Make sure she knows you love her   Help her use her own words and thoughts to better understand the factors underlying what she believes  Afterwards  it may be helpful to direct her to better sources than her friend  such as the  Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy  https   plato stanford edu    As a search

after  Make sure you are safe  Much love  and I'm always here if needed   I send some hate messages to the guy last year  blew some steam  although im not angry on myself anymore  i am still very much angry on the guy   Five years ago  you threatened someone  and they kicked your ass  and you threaten them again a year ago   You created the first situation  and didn't learn anything    because i didnt revenge a beating with a beating   What makes you so sure you wouldn't get your ass kicked a second time  and by the same individual   Since you started the situation  you deserved the first beating  and since you are trying to instigate another situation  you would fully deserve a second one    Now my advice need is  should i confront him phisically  He was twice my size back then  it's more balanced now    He will defeat you again   And again  and again  and again   He has the confidence of having succeeded once before  and with each successive win  he will gain even more confidence  and you will lose more confidence  And this is how it should be  since you are starting this   You need to grow up and act like an adult   It isn't very mature to contantly go around  trying to instigate fights  There are two kinds of cheating  unplanned  and deliberate deceptive     Unplanned cheating is a scenario like meet someone at a party  hit it off  get too drunk  do something you otherwise wouldn't and regret it the next day   While I think this is really shitty  if you don't have enough self control to stay true to someone  you shouldn't promise to stay true to them  it's understandable for a partner to forgive this as a one time event     What you have is not an accident or a one time event   It is an intentional  planned  continuous pattern of deception   Your boyfriend was lying to you every time he promised to stay monogamous  and was dishonest every time he talked to you because he was falsely representing himself and his commitment to the relationship    IMHO  if you can't trust his word on such an important thing  you can't trust his word on anything else either   So unless you want to be with someone that is literally 100  untrustworthy  I think you should leave this relationship and find someone better     Finally  you say you love him  and that's a powerful thing   But  and this may be the most painful but also most important thing to realize  the person you love may not exist  and may never have existed   You love a concept of this person  but that concept probably also includes honesty and integrity   The persona you love  loves you back   The persona you love would not intentionally deceive you or lie to you    However the person you've got is dishonest and has little integrity  he has continually deceived you and lied to you and apparently considers this to be an acceptable way to conduct the relationship with you    Therefore I argue that  by a certain interpretation at least  the person you love doesn't actually exist  he was an illusion created by the person you've got   It will take time to mourn the loss of this  and that's okay   But it's important that you do so  because otherwise you will just be continually deceived and lied to for as long as the relationship continues    Feels like I'm reading my own thoughts  12 24 pm here  and still nothing  Me 17 M  Gf  17  Guy 17 18 not sure I'm OG hood but all 'da hood' is for me is a collection of terraced houses and I've lived in worse   We had the odd SJW saunter in dictate then fuck off back to their palatial homes in suburbia   Weren't called SJW's back then they were urban facilitators on 40k a year   You can hit them with reality if you like   for instance one 'urban facilitator' called round in a brand new VW Golf GTi somebody broke in

deal with it early before you develop 'coping skills' that ultimately make you worse off  PTSD is best treated with combo of meds and therapy  however  the meds need not be long term in many people  Good luck my friend  It sounds like it is shot  and time to get a new one   Small appliances and kitchen gadgets like that sell for so cheap that it is unlikely that anyone would even work on it to

plan your futures  also understand that even if you dont stay with your gf  she will always be the mother of your child  youre stuck with her forever  so try to not let things get nasty even if you guys break up  at least for the kids sake  people do this all the time  have accidental babies and still succeed  and especially if you have help from your parents dont let it go to waste  both you

a toy   They may eat plastic that smells like food but even then most of them Not  You're worrying about absolutely nothing in that respect   Also   Idk how toys affect the growing of herbs   You should just communicate with the parents   Drop the bucket of toys off at their door with a note  saying that the kids are losing toys through the cracks and perhaps a rug or play mat would solve the

doesn't mean that you have accomplished  nothing    Take stock  give yourself credit for what you have done   Don't worry about the shit you haven't done  Not everyone is cut out to live up to "standards"     "Standards" aren't really standard  you know   Just like common sense isn't really all that common    And if not this  then take the job for less hours and more pay and use that extra

pick up from this and damn my hands are tired from all this typing  1  You should try video games out  have you played the last of us   missing out  2  Fuck whoever said that because there are so many different types of girls into different types of guys  No person is the same  although we have a pletra of pathetic basic minded individuals in most communities  3  Ehh young girls are creeped out by public boners so whatever dude 4  The beauty of this is that those girls were never worth your time  I sure as hell wouldn't want a girl who would shun a nice guy just because she wasn't into him   5  Fuck those bitches  keep on talking to people  yea it will hurt sometimes but you'll hit succession some where I know it and if you don't then it's better you tried your best than to ponder on "what ifs"  6  Again fuck those people  7   Pray at church instead of being so conscious of the females around you   I think being so conscious about what other people think is a huge problem  Seriously just stop giving a fuck man  in middle school I got bullied because I have Hyper hidrosis  my hands got sweaty AF  and so many people called me out on it and I really let it bring me down and it made

like that are pathetic af  I can't stand people who just wanna be with the cool crowd  Shows a lack of individuality and character    you got lucky you lose nothing from losing that girl I guarantee it   11   Just by her reaction    again if you were a guy that she was totally into  would you really want to date her   A girl who reacts like that  Idk I like my woman kind   12  STOP CARING ABOUT

girl you like get with a prick  You're not alone because allot of us has seen this  You know what i say  On to the next one  16  I also had social anxiety and what I did was start not giving a single damn about what other thought nor think about what people think of me and my life has gotten 500 times better  There is prescription out there for social anxiety that you can get through your doctor if you push hard enough but that's up to you  17  Sorry but your moms a bitch  get away from toxic people  family or not    18  Keep on following your fucking dreams because this shit is supposed to

terrible in high school and everyone thought that I was going to be worthless and now I'm on my way to becoming a doctor at a top tier medical school    so yea work hard and you will be rewarded  19

Apologies for the terrible grammar     rush game was strong  Exact finances aside   Ask yourself the following questions    How much more dangerous is it  Without knowing exactly what it is you're doing  it's difficult to say whether or not it's worthwhile   How likely are you to get a promotion   pay raise in your new job    How likely are you to find another job offer    Which job is full time   permanent     Would the people who've offered you the job  negotiate on their opening salary    If you dislike your current job and finding another one is going to be slim pickings  I'd think about taking the new job  If it's highly likely that you'll get another offer  then I'd opt for waiting for another offer that's offering better conditions and pay  What this sounds like is possibly he is suffering from self esteem issues  Possibly he's rejecting sex because he doesn't feel like he's good enough for it  or he feels embarrassed naked right now  It sounds weird  I know  but self esteem can do all sorts of shit to a person  How long has he been like this   This could also be stress related  Perhaps he's just worried about money or his security  Stuff like that can make someone feel too anxious to get down   Best way to know is just ask him about it  Try not to be in a nagging way  but just that you wanted to know if something was troubling him  Either way  it sounds like there's something making him nervous   And for only 5 cents an hour     I actually thought I was going to have something to do this year  but the person cancelled on me so I spent the day alone again  Meaning   Thank you for the reply  yes that does make more sense  I suppose I was nurturing a small hope of getting back together with her as well  I guess I was wrong   Cod liver oil  I know how you feel  It's not always easy being the one that's always there for everyone else  But for what it worth we're here for you  Even if we never meet just remember that there's always a few people here who

salt  but I've personally been trying to change this about myself too and this seemed to work for me  just got to practice  We all did it as kids  Make faces in the mirror  Making faces in the mirror will help you get accustomed to the facial expressions that you can make and maybe even help you get familiar with new ones    I started like this  When doing your morning routine  just take a minute and analyze yourself with a resting face and be mindful of any emotion that you are feeling  Could be anger  tiredness  happy sad  anything   Take that feeling and try expressing it on your face   Play around with it  go subtle  then exaggerate  You might surprise yourself with expressions that you thought you couldn't make  Get comfortable with you  then try to express that with others  Have fun with it  make it a game  I hope that helps at all  good luck and happy new year     I agree with your posted definition    Friendship can mean different things to different people   take a video of yourself tying your shoes and post it   maybe you're doing something different than most people  Youre more attractive than you thought  Congratulations   Also  there isnt anything called standards   Thats great  but what  same happened to me last week except      I didnt lose my virginity    I'm sixteen    She didnt want any relationship at all   but I'm happy for you Ehhh  I'm pretty sure those statistics include girls who casually play games on Facebook and on their phone when they have literally nothing else to do  I guess you could argue that they are "gamers " but personally I wouldn't count anyone that casually plays games only because they have nothing else to do at that time a "gamer "     otome game only have female players  Well yeah  otome games are visual novels for females  I would imagine that there aren't many guys who play otome games  but I bet there are as many if not more guys playing the opposite version though  No  I really am not great  I know this for a fact  I mean  we can't judge your situation  Ethics isn't clear cut  You should pay her  it's the right thing to do  but it sounds like you'll be homeless if you do   What's the question   P S  Let me know if you do try it and if you get any results   I REALLY hope you do message Ausgekugelt and consider taking his advice  It's sound  You're stronger than you know and you do seriously deserve

myself a lot in what you wrote  What helped me tremendously   making friends through shared hobbies  I know 4 people always happy to play tabletop games  another 3 always ready for video games  2 co workers with whom I can talk recipes and cooking stuff in depth  3 people to go rock climbing with  etc  It makes socializing painless because we are doing something we enjoy  and shared experiences are very nice to have    I usually shot down invitations to 'just hang out'  no shared activity  until we grow so close that I actually enjoy to do so  You can ask your ISP telephone provider to increase the gain on the line  you can get a repeater also   Repeaters ain't cheap   It's been years since I've had to deal with networking and I fuckin hate it  boo hoo I've to set up a new network for myself next week   But ask your sip telephone company increase the gain first before you start pissing about with repeaters n shit  Dude   i threathen him after the fight  He grabbed me from a beer line and punched me before ive had the chance to understand whats happening And your mentality that someone can beat you up because they did it before is very unbased on anything  Thank you for your advice anyway  Landlord found out about the dogs I'm kind of confused as to what "problem" you would like addressed hsr  You say you have yellow fever and prefer asian women  That's ok  we all have personal preferences and exclusivities  Then you say you idolize women  and that you would like to learn to "love" women  Sorry you're getting downvoted but your message is just getting losr  care to elaborate   That's awesome dude  Hope you got a lot more for new years  Next step  get one erryday  Yeah man  As someone who is done with school and has no friends either  I agree with and relate to everything you just said     so where does that leave the social outliers who weren't that great at making friends in their earlier years  what are they supposed to do   die alone The way to best come across to anyone is to leave color out of it  period  Not only can it inflame the SJW  it is just plain unnecessary  Your sister is with a bad influence and the best thing you can do is be a good role model    Let her know you love her and you're concerned that her friend doesn't respect her body enough and may not understand how badly a good education is necessary for your sister in your family's circumstances  Tell her that you'll always support her and that you hope she'll make decisions that will be better for her   Then wait  It's all you can do  I hope you and your family can get this sorted out  We're all one race  the human race  Is your friend Kayne West  I understand that  but perhaps you can negotiate with the landlord to avoid eviction  Dogs will leave or something     Well  we're on the way there anyway    He's mentioned it  and if that's what we need to do to get his green card  it's fine  We've been together nearly two years at this point so in the next few years we would anyway  I'm hoping we won't have to for his green card  but nbd either way  I've approached a few girls at a mall  It went better than i originally expected  but I haven't done any shit like that since  this was around 3 weeks ago  because i don't know      Shit is fucking hard  there is definitely some awkwardness  and I can't see how doing this ends up getting me a girlfriend   Before you ask how it went  out of the 5 girls i went up to  3 was just awkward as fuck because i clammed up and didn't know what to say and then i just left  the other 2 i managed to be normal and they were nice and smiley and both added me on facebook  where all manner of conversation fizzled out 2 days after    we did chat a little bit   One had a bf anyway   For the first 5 times I've ever done it it went pretty good  Actually now I kind of want to do it again  i just don't really know like what's the goal here or I don't see like    idk I've always just wanted a gf to love  IDK how viable this is to getting there  I'm turning 25 in a few months  still KV  Here's to optimism  You can do it     Here's to a fantastic 2017 FA is not a pissing contest  Ok   The way your backstory read  it sounded as if you had instigated the first fight   You are definitely trying to instigate a second fight  and this you are doing  after everything is said and done for    And your mentality that someone can beat you up because they did it before is very unbased on anything  Actually  it is based on something   When something has beat you before  it creates an anxiety within you  that contributes to you losing in the face of that adversary a subsequent time   Even as you speak  do you not realize that this is something of a fixation for you   This has taken over your ability to go on and live life  and be happy in the here and now  I hope you managed to have a happy new year   I struggle with anxiety and depression too  They truly are awful  I over analyse things and take things personally  and I hurt very deeply  In my 30 years on this earth  I've found there are no quick fixes  and they aren't always a bad thing  Hurting is a sign or caring and compassion  of being invested in something  I've made a list for myself of things to do when I feel this way   going for a walk  reading a book  a cup of tea  listening to music  writing in my journal  Self care is important for everybody  and especially so for those of us who feel so intently   I wish you peace for 2017    You need therapy not revenge    You have been petty in bringing it up with him  he's apologised  Why would kicking his ass help anything  What if he beat you up again in self defence  I can't say I completely understand your reference  yet I'm still laughing   Gonna be another lonely year for me then    Thinking  What kinds of things do you think about people  In what kinds of situations do you think these things  What kinds of people make you think these things  What do they do   What do you do that looks mean  What is it about what you do that makes it look mean  To lead an authentic life  For years I've worn a mask to make other people comfortable  The disingenuity made me feel hollow  so I've decided to just roll with it and be myself  I opened up to my Facebook friends about being mentally ill  so I'm off to a good start   I think i've expressed myself badly  I didn't cause anything  i can't remember to ever start a fight  i threatened him after the beating  he grabbed me from a beer line and punched me in the face before i had the chance to underdtand whats happening The Damned  The Veil  Housebound  horror comedy   They're Watching  The Haunting in Connecticut     soo many I think it's clear that you are harbouring some serious issues if after 5 years you are still wanting to do something to HIM about it  You should do something to YOU about it because it's not healthy to hold on to this for so long  especially after he apologised   I was randomly beat up in a park on a Summer day when I was 16   I'm 31 now and I don't want to do something to the people who did that to me  They were just drunk assholes  I didn't get an apology  How long can you harbour this ill will for before you accept that it is damaging you to do so  Thank you everyone for your kind words    Glad to read that you are safe    Your mother sounds exactly like mine  My mother is vindictive and nasty  and horribly insecure  I can't cut her out of my life either  unfortunately  But as I've grown older  I'm 30   I've put boundaries in place with her  If she rings and berates me  I hang up  If we go out somewhere and she calls me names  I get up and leave  I cannot change her behaviour  but I can control how I respond  As someone above said  if you wouldn't tolerate that treatment in an intimate relationship  you don't have to tolerate it because you share DNA    Take care of yourself xox Hang in there chickadee    I realise i have a big fixation on this  that's why i brought it up  It used to keep me from living life altogether  made me hate myself and think  I'm a coward bla bla  For that stuff that i overcame  and not base myself on the ego to know who I am  I am actually thankful I got the beating  But my problem is I still hate him deeply  I shook almost everything else off  I've created flowers out of mold  crystals from the pressure inside of me  BUT my hatred for him still staies  also my way with girls is not how i wanted it to be  i felt humiliated in from of the girl whom I considered of my dreams  and I struggle to  understand that any girl takes me for serious snymore  even though they might do  i think this fear alone attracts the very thing I don't wish   to not be taken for real It's maaaany hurdles but like the other guy above me said  Get out of the comfort zone  It can be big but no need to make things large amd scary  Start small  It could be the smallest thing that you'd want to get over but the most important part is just starting somewhere and keep going  Most people see this huge mountain and faint evn before stepping onto it  Giving yourself attainable short term goals that give you positivity and VICTORIES are what you need    For example it could be that stranger that you sometimes make eye contact with at school  Show a smile  Say hi  You didn't talk to anyone for the break  That's ok  when school starts you could make it a point to tell any person one thing you did over the break  You noticed that your body language might be offputting  but you have great eyes  That could be a starting point too  If you're not sure how to even start  observe others that are naturally inviting with it  compare and contrast the two then try copying it  Your starting point can be anything  they are all relevant skills that need to be practiced anyhow  As you garner more experience and of course enevitable  stumble along the way  you will learn  and grow grow grow  I hope that helps at all and have  a Happy New Year   Are you intimidated by said guy  That does explain a lot    I've removed your post   We don't allow fundraising in here  and I've removed sadder causes than this in the past   Since we don't have a registration and verification process in here  it leaves the subscriber susceptible to scams   Also  I am going to ask that you read our rules  and understand that you will be banned on your next rule break   Rules are linked at the top of our sidebar  First off  don't listen to people who tell you that your high school years should be the best years of your life  It may have been for them  but that doesn't mean that you're obligated to feel the same way    Try branching out if you've got the time  Does your school have any after school clubs  Is there a sport you've always wanted to try out  Meeting new people can be hard  but it gets easier every time     I don't know  I know it's very bad for me  I wish to be free of this limiting issue  but for real  not pretend to be so  because that way it will still be affecting my judging in a more or less way but it will still be there  snd I will only be in denial  Deepen the relationships that I care about  and eventually naturally smile at every person i make eye contact with   So its in the uk  in the area most known for robin hood  it's an old house and was called dorngale  Ok   Since this seems to be rooted in wanting help to get back into relationships  I need to remove this  and am going to ask that you read our rules   But I would say to talk to a counselor   They can help you past this  What the hell  no one answered your question  How worthless are you people   Colleges don't look at individual grades just credit hours  They'll see you have higher than a 2 5 gpa then will look at what classes you passed  transfer those credits in and either start you as a junior or make you take the requirements for that specific major   I left community college with a 1 7 gpa in 2002  then went back and finished with a 3 8 in 2014  When I took my credits to a 4 year college they never cared what my original gpa was just the classes I passed   Fyi  grades and gpa means nothing in the real world  just as long as you have proof of you passing   Have you looked into what it would cost to test  I ask because I originally didn't get tested for the same reason  I have a family history  but my relatives with cancer were already deceased by the time I discovered the test and I didn't think it would be affordable  Often insurance companies will cover it if you have a strong family history and it turned out to be not that expensive  Even if you think you might have one  testing to see which BRCA gene  1 or 2  is mutated can be helpful    Best of luck with your decision  Dealing with the family aspect of that was really frustrating for me  especially on top of finding out about the genes and statistics    I'm in sort of the same situation  I work from 3 9pm so I've been sleeping in a lot    I think the main issue would be relationship wise  You might be awake when the people around you are asleep  and asleep when they're awake  Just try to make sure you aren't too isolated   I think it's a bit obvious that I've felt that way  But just be yourself  Unless you're a complete prick  But seriously though  I connected with her by being myself and not trying to pretend to be someone else  Try meeting girls through friends  That will probably work the best  I don't know  but you could invest in Darn Tough socks  They have a lifetime warranty so when they get damaged you return them  r buyitforlife swears by them   Yes she knew  she kinda "took the lead" and quietly told me how to do things or what she wanted  The only things I knew how to do were because I read them on Reddit  I lasted pretty long  But I guess that's what you get for wanking it all that time   Thankyou  I've been the same way  All my friends around me were way more socially and sexually active  Don't let it get to you  Just do what you enjoy  You'll meet someone eventually    Make contact with old school friends on facebook and ask to meet up  what do you do when you meet up  In some ways it gets easier   but in other ways it gets harder   The nice thing about getting older is that age isn't really a factor in who could become a friend   For me this happened in my early 20s  making friends who were 6 8 years older than me  and it continued in my late 20s  making friends who were in their 30s or 40s   The number of people you can potentially be friends with is HUGE as you get older   This is great if you have obscure hobbies or interests  As an example   my SO was in his late 20s when he became friends with a man in his 70s  I kid you not   They enjoy talking about similar things so it's been a meaningful friendship over the years   Another benefit of getting older  in my experience   is that you start to appreciate people who you wouldn't have appreciated when you were younger   I'm embarrassed to say that there were a few kids I went to high school with whom I didn't bother to get to know because I thought they were weird  I talked with them at our 10 year reunion and they were so cool  Now that I'm older I see their eccentricities as positive   not negative  My experience at work has been similar   we have the same mixture is types of people you would have in a high school  jocks  nerds   etc    but despite our differences   we all get along well   work well together   and most importantly   care about each other and enjoy each other's company   Now for the bad  it can be challenging to meet new people as an adult  You're not enrolling in a new class with new peers every semester  You don't have opportunities to bond with others over difficult homework assignments   All in all   it gets better   Hang in there  I would never go back to be a teen again  Seriously   it's tough   but growing up takes a lot of the problems away  can you tell me an example  I'm not sure what kind of potential troubles you are talking about  4chan is just a bloody website  They might keep you blocked forever  and I think that's about the worst which could possibly happen  Or I don't quite understand what you are asking  She's on birth control  I didn't have any  if you hadn't even had your first kiss until 19  packing condoms isn't really something you think about   Yes I know I've been incredibly stupid and that condoms aren't only for preventing pregnancy  But in the heat of the moment  I couldn't be bothered and just wanted to experience it  Next time I'm definitely wearing one though   I think that class schedule sounds like a good fit for your current sleep schedule  BUT   I would really encourage you to do what it takes now to get on a more "normal" sleep schedule  The vast majority of jobs for college graduates expect you to be there during normal work hours  You are going to have an extremely difficult time performing well at work  or even keeping your job  after you graduate if you are accustomed to your current schedule  It might take some time to change it and get used to it  so better to start now  Maybe you can ask people whose interests lie in that area   I don't know the first thing about it  and couldn't even make an intelligent suggestion      I thought I made it clear that making out led into sex  but maybe I could've worded it better  There are some definite similarities between the two stories  I hope you find closure on it all soon   There are many possible reasons    Are you walking in socks  without shoes  a lot  On stone floor  Are your shoes loose  Do you frequently have sand in your shoes  Are the socks very cheap  I tend to make friends slowly  maybe meeting only 1 good friend every few years  But over time it adds up  Here's where my current friends are from  1 from middle school  1 from high school  2 from college  although I'm only close with one of them   1 from grad school  2 from work  1 from an extracurricular activity  1 from another extracurricular activity  etc  Along the way I've met many other people who I enjoyed spending time with and I would have considered them my friends at that time in my life  but in terms of genuine  lasting friendships  I've accumulated those slowly  And that's ok  Quality over quantity  I tried learning an instrument but didn't have the willpower to practice a lot   I just wanted to learn to play guitar because I thought I'd have fun playing once I knew some stuff but the only thing I could do was simple exercises over and over  People who play games are gamers   just because you have your own personal definition of what a 'gamer' is  casual games don't count 11  11   doesn't mean that women don't play games   Otome games aren't visual novels  A lot of otome games  are  visual novels  but otome games are just games directed towards women  yeah  there was such little content for women that they had to invent a word for games geared towards women   which can be anything   But basically  my point   plenty of gamer girls exist  Gamer girls who are into the same games as  you  are  are probably very few  Much like how there's very few guys who are into otome games  NO NO NO NO NO  Stable  grown men do not do this  Although right now it's JUST emailing to get to know each other  and next it'll JUST be lunch  all those JUSTs start to build up and next thing you know it it was JUST a kiss  He's a creep  RUN NOW  Good luck  If you are interested at all  you're gonna have to try and find out I guess    I don't think there's another way Maybe a body pillow  Seems like your issue is becoming a her issue    which it shouldn't   I just wanted to add that I also have the same issue  I'm still only young  but I should have had my license 5 years ago    I just can't do it  attempting to drive even an automatic car leads to almost immediate panicking and crying  I just know that I can't trust any other drivers to actually follow the road rules  and I have to watch absolutely everything and everyone because of it  My high sensitivity and tendency for overstimulation doesn't help  nor does my poor spatial sense   It feels horrible since everyone I know can drive with no issues  but I feel like I have less autonomy and freedom since I'm either at their mercy or the mercy of public transport  I'm planning on moving to a large European city where having a car would be a major hassle  since then it'd hopefully be easier to blend in and I wouldn't feel like such an embarrassment   But on the plus side  cars are exceptionally expensive with insurance  repairs  petrol  fines  and parking to pay for  You probably save money by not having one  If countries ever ban cars or hike prices of petrol because of climate change  then you'll be in a good position since you're already used to not having a car  I just wish it wasn't so 'normal' to drive  You can actually greet New Year to stranger in street parks  I'm sure they won't get angry with you  Yeah you were  I wish you good graces as well My point is that under the same conditions both hemp flax oil and fish oil are both equally likely to spoil     I prefer fish oil among other animal products high in epa  dha  for various reasons  but mostly for the poor conversion rate of short chain omega 3 fatty acids ie ala  to long chain omega 3fatty acids  epa dha    I'd like to add that she should change her locks  There is a chance he has a spare key somewhere  do not let him have that opportunity  How about you pay her back  Here's to hope she's being honest with you and that she didn't give you an STD This is the funniest thing I've read all year    Don't bring it up  you'll just make it awkward between you  Even if he did notice  if you act like nothing happens  he'll likely forget about it soon  I work in Los Angeles and work closely with AC and C And they're not going to do anything to help the bird   Also  it's i against LA Municipal Code to handle and feed pigeons so you could catch a ticket for taking the bird  Your boss wants to be in that porn with you  I think we're supposed to question his judgement  I have a very large age gap with my girlfriend  however both of us knew what we wanted before we even met    The chances of him just wanting friendship are not high  but you never know for certain  What about "talk to strangers"  I don't know why but I never gain much weight  I eat all I can but still I am skinny    Yeah like I said they're single  Because one is overweight and the other idk what's up  Some times it's just like that if you're a guy or girl    Can't you set up a gaming society at college  You're all adults of drinking age  Part of being an adult is taking responsibility for your actions    The two girls who got too drunk pay the rides  The girl who threw up pays the cleaning fee  You and Cindy don't pay anything   Cindy's idea to help paying is noble  but dumb and unfair  It's you and her who already went out of your way to care for the others as is  It's Ashley's job to offer paying you back  no matter what she's going through  Having "a difficult time"  that she might have gotten herself into as well   is no justification to create a mess and expect others to deal with it    I'd suggest allowing Ashley a day to recover and to contact you on her own  In case she doesn't  remind her of what happened and that you'd appreciate it if she paid you back  Be friendly  but firm  If she can't pay right now  she can suggest an alternative  Also  I'd spare her the embarrassment of letting her know that she's having a tough time   unless you don't see any other alternative     i just don't really know like what's the goal here  Either an instant date or to set up plans for a future date and or exchange numbers   This is good for health  go to my link   get a good health  Even some FAs think money doesn't make a difference but when you don't have any it really is limiting  Then perhaps he isn't the man you should be with  The choice is yours though  but his behaviour will continue   Sherwood Woods  The Hoods Hood   No worries  OK soo out of all of that your crew said you were doing really well   I'd take what your mum said with a grain of salt unless she's been talking directly with your supervisors she might just be projecting her concerns frustrations     Does your mum know the full extent of the situation as well has she or anyone else in the family ever had to deal with anxiety previously     How's the hunt for psychology councillors going   Oh wow the potential dream job sounds amazing    Definitely even more reason to try find someone who can help in terms of proper techniques etc as will def help your cause future   Would also maybe suggest your gf maybe seeks some extra support as well even if is just to help you get through some of the tougher times     Also yes def should try out yoga    Hope your new years went OKish otherwise    I don't know  I just said it to my mom one day because I thought the same thing  I realized much later that it hurt her feelings and made her sad  and she has no desire to divorce him at all  I was just projecting  We work together through our issues  we're best friends but we may as well also be partners  P  I've tried a body pillow as well as other pillows and things  it's not about the feeling of someone next to me  I have also tried white noise machines  radios  asmr and various other things that might help with replacing that  In the end knowing that someone is there is always the easiest way for me to relax   Used to be the same for me  but in my case I had to start eating a lot of smaller meals inbetween the larger meals  I easily ate a big breakfast  pizza for lunch  mcdonalds for dinner etc and never put on a single kg  When I started lifting last year I forced myself to get some oatmeal  protein shakes  sandwiches  pasta you name it  several times a day inbetween meals  I'm not gonna lie it haven't gotten easier  it's a real chore to force myself to eat constantly but it's the only way I gain weight  But before you do any of that thought  just eat like you do on a regular day and get a proper calorie count  you might be eating way less than you think you are  I always joke to people when they ask what my new years resolution is  I always say hopefully passing in my sleep   people laugh  but its true lmao  I wouldn't worry about the cat  it might chew the toys but they're generally smart enough not to eat them     Hold onto the toys longer then eventually the kids will regret doing them down and learn to stop doing that    Or  tell them to get a designated bucket with a rope they can lower down that you will agree to put the toys into  Then the toys will be stuck between the wood beams and the screen   The screen needs to be on the top   Hey  They don't need a written  to fire you since you "quit"  Walking off the job without notice or warning meansigns you areally quitting  You didn't get terminated    so you are not eligible for entitlement or even unemployment   After your 3 day no show  a walk off was probably the last straw as they see that you decided to not to work    If you got any questions  I am around to answer  Wow what assholes  They could have gotten themselves or other innocent people killed  Why are you hanging out with these immature jerk faces  They certainly don't seem like they respect you   I've taken many many different antidepressants over the years  most of the SSRI's have caused some degree of appetite or sexual function change and these are well documented  but I'm not sure if they affected my cognition at any point beyond the issues that were already apparent because of the depression  However I have had two seperate courses of Mirtazapine which I'm fairly certain have caused aphasia  I often find it difficult to have a flowing conversation due to the fact that I often "lose words" to the point where I have to consider a career change  Get your head out of your ass and buy her a ring  You had to convince her which means she wanted one  The ring is about her  not you  and doesn't have to be  10k  Jesus christ  Honestly  Based on your selfies you look like a solid 8  Kinda looks like TZUYU or Park Boyoung depending on the pic  Not not attractive at all  I think you can and should be more confident about yourself    Edit  Also  get help if you're having suicidal thoughts  There are plenty of resources if you're living in Canada   I'm really glad that you're better now    I've honestly never had to deal with depression or any kind of mental illness myself or even financial problems so it just seems that she and I come from completely different worlds and that is only just dawning on me  It's taken a long time   I've always been very self preservative by just going "Oh you think you can just leave me out in the cold  Well I'll do it to you first " and I've been so afraid that that was what I was doing to her  you know ruining the oldest friendship I have at the moment    But I've come to the conclusion that this is the best for me and she will get over it  We need to take care of ourselves before taking care of everyone else   who said worthless people dont have fulfilling lives even athletes singers and jobless criminals have fulfilling lives So basically you're hoping for an apocalypse to break the emasculating tedium of your current existence  so you can stick it to all the people that you don't like and become the asocial alpha that normal law wont allow  Interested in being funnier too  Could I have those resources too  Either dont bring it up  or make it a  huge joke at your own expense  and don't give or let on you remember details  "How smashed was I last might  man  I had this vivid dream I was touching a dude " see how he reacts and respond accordingly  Either don't say anything else or be like  "yeah  it was so crazy vivid what if it was real  " and then start making jokes  Yeah  exactly  Scrambling around trying to find a way to help sometimes just worsens the situation  ex I have a feeling that I'm just a stress factor to my friend    I'm really glad that you are better   Are you    Feeding eggs to a bird  Update  it didn't go well this time  Oh well  this year's goal is to make at least 3 new   real   friends by improving my social skills  This is a very big goal   I'll treat yesterday like a starting point  and see what I'll be doing in 364 days in order to measure my progress    Isn't getting a bj suppose to make you cool   Oh man  props to your dad  If that were my daughter being attacked I would be a felon for sure  Anyways  my fianc had a similar problem with an abusive piece of shit  She moved over to her grandparents for a while where we had a LDR for 2 years  then she moved back here after the majority of her shock subsided  I try to make everything as normal as possible for her  but she still has issues with it  Maybe moving somewhere else would help you as well  I'm sorry you had to go through this  People are really shitty  That's exactly what most people do  but every now and then you click and the 10 min convo leads to numbers exchanged   It's probably hard to hear  but I doubt you're ready for a committed relationship  Which isn't a big deal since you're young  Either way  unchecked feelings lead to bigger problems  If you aren't that invested  I suggest breaking up before you are  yeah i confronted her ans she admited to it  but she sidnt have sex with any one and she is really sorry for what happened  i tried breaking up with her but she doesnt let me  she is trying to prove she diserves me and she needs me  i dont know if ill stay   I can assure you he did not  God only does good  No problem and yeah I assumed you were  Try to just let her go though for both of your sakes   How can I help No   Didn't have my first kiss until 21 and the only reason I had some condoms before then is my roommates gave me some as a joke  so definitely justifiable   Explains my life then Pfft  I had a lot of girls wish me a happy new year   My mom  my sister  my niece     Hey no problem man  Just keep your head up and remember that you have a whole life ahead of you  You're only a high school student   Good luck  bud   D Online     here https   therapists psychologytoday com  when you select

you had a bad year  I did too  I'm very sorry to hear about both your grandmas and your cat   In 2016  I lost my last remaining Grandma to a really shit death  and her crap doctor didn't really help  he messed up her palliative drugs   I lost my job and I'm stuck on benefits again struggling to find work   Edit I did have a great time dating my  now ex  boyfriend for a while then that went south too  he broke up with me twice  then I ended it the third time  but I hope we can be friends   So not a great year for me either  Other things happened too    I hope you have a much better 2017  I hope the same for me and anyone reading this too   So the OP tells her how good looking she is  A year's a long time  You never know  It's so good to see this clean  You are lucky dude gal  Happy New Year    That's what I did  and ironically your comment was removed as well  I've only just approved it now that I was made mod    Good bye everyone  you all helped me so much and I wish the best on all of you     who the hell was that    every farewell thread ever In different ways yes and no   Yes   You don't get to pick where you go to high school and what kids you see every day  At high school you are basically locked into a general group of people with all different ambitions and lifestyles  As an adult you get to pick what career field you work in  where you live  and most importantly what hobbies adult you wants to do  This is where you meet people who are more like minded like you  As a kid you have a lot of friends  as you get older you end up making more close friends than friends in general   No    Unless you live on campus in college  join the military  or join some other career where you spend almost all of your day with people  you'll never be in a similar situation to meet friends again  In high school  things just aren't that serious  You go to school and talk to your friends and work comes along every now and again  Once you start working you will run into people with kids  old friends  family they have to see  etc  You will meet a lot of people who just want to get their work done so they can go home  You might be 20 years old and the next closest person to you at work is in their 30's   Basically what I'm trying to say is focus now and focus hard on your future  I'm not saying quit trying to make friends or anything but just decide what lifestyle YOU want to live  What job YOU want to do  Do you want to go to college   Until you answer these questions life might be hard  If you feel trapped in a place you don't like living  it can suck and demotivate you from doing anything socially  I had the burden of living somewhere I didn't want to live  When I finally realized it I told myself I would move to       in       months  My biggest regret was that I didn't decide sooner  If you're happy  other people will be attracted to you   PS  Most people I went to high school with have entirely different groups of friends now  They might see each other around the holidays but for the most part everybody has found new friends  I'm sorry this is so old  Anyway she was in there for two weeks on the day before my boyfriend was able to pull her out   I've been caught in a thought circle  staring at a wall most of the time  I've stopped living my life and I'm terrified to put myself out in the world while I'm just this disaster  I have a huge problem communicating after having isolated for so long  School and work mixed with substance abuse and my mental health problems caused a lot of distress  I'm going to try to

everyone gets Ma'am ed and Sir ed all over the place regardless of age or position   I didn't realize til adulthood that it was considered rude or an indication of old age in other regions  That sounds like it must've really made a difference  I'm definitely going to emulate this and hopefully regain some real sense of self  Were there points where you felt like giving up and things like that  or was it easy to keep in the swing of doing things  And nah  that doesn't sound weird at all  I've tried doing similar things  but I haven't done it often  I'll try more frequently cause it's nice to have that reassurance  even if it is from yourself  Thanks I hope I will one day  Hahaha that sound so awesome man  I'd like to do that noise with someone but got no one  What a shame  Lol  But you're right  if the world is unkind  don't add up to it and make it worse  I  myself  am a huge pushover  Its not like I have bullies  but when I meet mean  disgusting people  no matter how pissed I am  I just let it go  I figured  there's not much that I can get if I brawl with them as Im not that kind of person and brawling sound so much effort    Its nice to talk to nice people  Its just whats on mind right now     Pigeons are tasty  You need a few more for a decent pie though  Well excellent  I guess I don't even need to try in 2017  Long story short  Whilst it is legitimate to be concerned for your sister  any matters of discipline and preventing her talking to someone are matters for your parents    not   you   tl dr  not your circus  not your monkeys Well I tried  This morning me and mom where talking about my life  As soon as a started getting too deep into the abuse she goes "Stop save that for your counselor"  If only I had the luxury of being able to stop thinking about it  They will never understand  I will die misunderstood with my life spread across 5 different counselors and 2 different websites   College in the netherlands isn't really a place for communities and stuff  It's just a place where you learn  The closest thing there is is a student organisation but most activities there are parties   2 things in conversation are focus and tempo   You correctly predict that it sounds massively condescending because of the focus  The amount of emphasis you put on it makes it seem like you are being deliberately condescending  if you make it a lighter and shorter "it sounds like you think  this   it is actually  this "   The next important part is tempo  people don't remember conversations or interactions  they just remember how they feel  so it is important to leave the conversation in a positive note always  After you give criticism  turn the conversation into something else  any other topic so that the whole general tempo of the conversation is not about the criticism  I never did get around to reading Ender's Game  I'll grab a copy to read   In high school I knew about it but at the time I judged books by their cover rather harshly   http   www somesmart com wp content uploads badender jpg  It was a little too cheesy for me   p  I hear you on the moral gray area   I had a hard time playing those Telltale games when they first came out   Sometimes I would want to choose the violent paths but would end up going against my judgement and choose the safe path   Typically I do this in life as well   I'm not honest with myself and instead appease others   Most things I see are in black and white  but I'll work on reaching that gray outlook  Happy New Year  buddy  I'm glad you're here  otherwise I might get bored  Take care of yourself  And for God's sake    take a goddamn shower      At least in the south it's mostly a sign of respect  As an older man I still say it to older and younger women to show them respect and courtesy  It may also be a reaction to your positive appearance   I hope you had the self respect not to fulfill their demands  o that's terrible      hey man  i bet that despite all the shit that's gone on over the last 2 years  there were still moments where you became a better person  learnt new things and experienced all new emotions   whenever I look back at moments in the past and my life in general  I just think how despite all of those shitty moments  I learnt something from every single one of them  I've learnt how to be a more empathetic and caring person to others from how others have treated me like shit for example   I think times like these call for the most amount of reflection  and my favourite quote for times like these is 'if you hit rock bottom  stay there because that's when you learn the most' or something along those lines  Definitely report it as inappropriate sexual harassment  Indeed  I was pointing out how dumb you must be to  1  imagine for more than three seconds that there is a notion of "worth" for human beings and  2  that you could assess the said worth based on  what you see in 30min of  the job the said human being does to earn the necessary money to live his life   I suggest we stop here  you are too much of an idiot who thinks she he has figured it all  And yet nobody seems to have thought "doing it" meant sex  Sigh  Sounds like he likes you and wants a closer relationship with you but is incredibly shy   You'll probably be fine  but you should probably let someone in your house know   sarcasm Maybe you'll win the lottery  https   www reddit com r politics comments 1oz3wc privatization benefits the 1 while public ccx3ds5   Administrative overhead is 3x less for single payer  http   www nejm org doi full 10 1056

You and this person are over  right  Why do you think you get a say in who either of them have sex with  And how do you know they aren't dating or in love  Why not be happy for them instead of being petty and losing two people you're close to  funny how a woman started kissing everybody last night and before she finished with others I got away and hidden in my room Maybe you can die fighting in the civil war  That's awesome   But what makes you think he's incredibly shy  "Yeah man  you bringing it up because you want to give me one too "   I live in the northeast and people rarely call me ma'am  I'm in my early 40s  and I figure that ma'am means they think I'm old  When I was in my 20s  I called a dude in his 40s sir  and he was offended  Only 1 in 292 201 338 for the Powerball jackpot    Not bad  LOL   r asablackman  I can't say I like it but I also realize that there isn't much of an alternative     I'm long past the "Miss" stage and "Hey lady " seems a little wrong somehow       So I'm a "Ma'am " Yeah basically you're right  If you're attractive it really doesn't matter what your interests are  Yes   You can tell your parents that you have something personal to ask the Dr  or you can even make the appointment yourself and go without their knowledge  Though that might be difficult depending on your age  There's also school counselors you can reach out to who can advocate for you to your parents  Any adult you are comfortable with can help you talk to them if you're you nervous  If they are good parents then they will want to know how you're feeling and want to help you   He wants to know more about you  he wants to be closer to you  he's interlocking fingers  this is an attempt at intimacy  But he he's having difficulty letting you know verbally that he likes you  Being that close to you and thinking about telling you makes him sweat from anxiety  He probably wants to ask you out or tell you he likes you or something but can't bring himself to do it   Aids  I know a guy who within weeks of starting university got a girlfriend and they are still together after 6 years  I knew this guy quite well and he was no chad  a bit quiet and not particularly outgoing but had a face that girls would look for I guess   If you are wondering he is half asian and I don't know about you but I've yet to see an unattractive half asian  They seem to get the best of both worlds in terms of facial genetics lol  I guess his personality was a factor but I reckon his looks were what got her attention  at least initially  Not sure where people come up with the idea that therapists have all of these severe clients with all of these devastating problems  but the truth is that the majority of clients are pretty middle of the road like you when it comes to symptom severity  The rule of thumb is that if it's a problem for you and it's inferring with your ability to function or affecting your quality of life  then by all means seek help for it   I also don't know if people realIze that therapists get paid to help people   it's a job  not a volunteer position  So I have no clue why people feel like seeking us out for help is a burden  It's a burden to put your problems onto your significant other or your friends for an extended period of time  but helping people sort out their problems is literally the job of a therapist  and one that we are trained to handle  Lastly  why people think that they are somehow a "stronger" person if they don't seek help for mental problems is beyond me    Would you say  "Well  I have a broken leg with the bone sticking out  but I think that I can make it on my own and that doctors have patients with 'real' problems so I should be able to handle this on my own"  Not to mention that it's very insulting to people that do have the courage to seek help   THAT'S being a strong person   So my advice to you would be to make an appointment with a therapist so you can start to feel better  You should probably go see a therapist   I tried When you say you suffer from an inferiority complex  that is just one small part of who you are    Instead of feeling like your 'suffering' from this I hope you can exist without that guilt weighing over your head reminding you your not worthy   Are you interested in him  Wot are condoms  I already have an appointment set up  That's not what I was asking  Also  I don't self medicate with alcohol  I have no idea where you got that from  Because I had a few beers on New Years Eve  Don't you think you're being a little drastic   it's 6am on new years   nobody's up  For oldies  look for anything with Vincent Price  Sorry if I was a bit accusatory  You have nothing to feel bad about if you didn't know  especially if you didn't buy him  It's just something to consider  From your description  you seem like a good and responsible owner who provides George with company  which is good  A lovely thought for his unborn child that they "ruined" their father's life  I'm glad you found this   The negative talk has been a big part for me   Growing up I didn't really have supportive people in my life   My dad was a drunk and consistently undermined my achievements   My mom had so much anxiety that she would shut down my attempts at independence by the thought that I would harm myself or be lead down a negative   My aunt's family was intertwined with mine and her son my cousin was a sadist  obsessed with torturing me in any manner possible   Bullies  dismissive teachers  an inability to understand people  opportunistic friends   etc   The my pessimistic view of the world is practically hardcoded into my brain   I have to force myself back into my reality consistently on a day to day basis or else I get trapped by the voices of my past  I'm learning to train my brain into at least a less pessimistic version   I met a friend in an online chat group  she's much older than I am and has been through a lot   She helped me with the essay portion of a college application   As we went through each question  I would answer things in my way and she would point out that I was incredibly negative   She found a way to spin things into incredibly positive views that I would never have thought otherwise   In the difference between mine and the right kind of mindset is incredible   I understand where you are coming from with the anxiety   I thought my problems were solved a long time ago as well  but it's important to accept that there will be moments of relapse   It's a long process and I believe the best medicine is exposure to the events that cause anxiety   What helped me the most was a local support group that made me feel welcome  listened to what I had to say  and provided excellent feedback   To be honest  I wouldn't even dare to make posts like this online before but I've learned to be more open   I like that subreddit  it's spreading good vibes and certainly beats the heck out of advice animals  A lot of people certainly do point out my self awareness and I think I've been internalizing that more and more   Sometimes I wish I wasn't so self aware but I hope that it will allow me to help others when the time comes   As for the letters  Somewhere around Spring of 2016  I did my round of contacting   I contacted everyone that I possibly could   Some were happy to hear from me  others wanted more of an explanation  and some were completely angry and held onto so much resentment that no amount of what I said could change how they feel   It made me feel better but I still get glimpses of the person I used to be and have to shake the feeling I had back then   I'm at war with my demons and from time to time I get overwhelmed  but I'm doing whatever I can to fight back   I use Microsoft's OneNote to keep track of all my progress and it syncs with my phone so I'm always able to write down new bits of insight as they come   It's been helpful   Sorry for this incredibly lengthy reply  I have a knack for detail  I like that quote  "   doesn't mean you future can't be better than you ever imagined "  That really resonates with me   Good hearing from you and I hope you continue to make progress in your own journey    Lol congrats my friend And i never understood why  whatever I do I am this guy  It sucks   I hear you  and I understand why you're upset  It must be pretty frustrating  But it sounds more like she was scared to tell you about it and scared of your possible reaction  and she made a mistake by not telling you about her relationship with him sooner  And it sounds like she might really like him and is also scared to be honest  maybe with herself  about that  This doesn't seem like a reason to end your friendship with either of them  My best friend and I have been in each other's lives for more than three decades now  and we have dated many of the same guys are pretty years  It's pretty normal and something that happens with people a lot  I know so many people who started out dating one friend and then end up dating married to a different friend in the group  You can choose to be angry and lose your friends over it or you can be sympathetic  understand what your friends are feeling  and keep them in your lives  It's completely up to you  This is exactly how I was treated throughout my teenage years  It's why as a 23 year old adult I try to have as little contact with other people as possible  Better to have no friends than "friends" like this  Wake someone up and tell them  Yes I realize that  I'm posting this as me seeing through their games  They obviously were more manipulative than that   The car wouldn't start  From what I understand  the ending of a relationship is considered a loss of someone  so yes  you could apply the stages of grief from this  However  even when it comes to the death of a loved one  any model of stages of grief is not universal  Just because you do not follow the grieving stages of most people doesn't mean something is wrong with you   It might be possible that  to you  the relationship had ended awhile ago   when you first thought about breaking up with him  That happened to my past relationship  which went on for about two months longer than it should have    What you describe sounds like some dissociation  not to be confused with dissociative identity   Experiencing some dissociation doesn't necessarily mean a mental disorder  but it is a symptom of anxiety  Anxiety has a high comorbidity rate with depression   This is not  trivial   this is a  dealbreaker    I'm not a mental health professional  I may not be completely correct   Thanks for the response   Please note that I'm fairly green at reddit netiquette and culture  so I'm tentative about how things work here  and how do you produce the user links     My general approach to these discussions is that I avoid "how to" discussions as an introduction    The goal of my post is to start  dialog with the OP  not to write a self help book in every post   In my experience  90   of OPs never respond  and I don't want to burn energy saying more that necessary to elicit interest   My perspective is the result of my own 58 years of inquiry and effort  I did a lot of things in that time  including Zen and books and teachers and introspection and all the usual candidates    I like a lot of the usual spiritual growth tools  I'm not out to reinvent them from scratch or declare the One True Path   There are some aspects of my views that are a bit distinctive  or emphasized more than others somewhat   For example  I hold that "all transformation passes through freedom"  which is a claim about the nature of freedom and its relationship to being whole    To be whole  one must first become free  and "freedom" here refers to the ability to extract oneself from the addictions and traps that the mind constructs around ego maintenance and survival   Beyond freedom  I talk about "coherence"    coherence is the subject where the main question is "what does one do with freedom "  What's it good for  how should it be 'spent' to enrich the whole of life     I'm writing a book on my perspective  some more details about that can be found here  https   antiblog quora com The structure of transformation srid C3lY Seems fucked up  but I'm no birdologist so I don't know what Mr  Burt would want to eat It is normal to feel those kinds of things when faced with distressing images  While  according to DSM  developing PTSD or ASD requires a life threatening event  it is possible that it has left a deep impact    What are some of the strategies people have suggested  I believe it's time for you to learn Bird Law  Welp  I've been doing it for 36 years and hasn't happened yet  Ain't nobody got time for that  Multiply by altitude  substract several hours  add a bit of holy s       No wonder he passed out   I do believe that anxiety and depression cause long term cognitive impairment  just that for different people it's of different degrees  or not at all   Before I got depression and anxiety  my cognitive functioning was pretty fast  My grades were good  After illness  I could feel my own cognitive processing deteriorate  although I didn't know what was happening then  I was 12   I recently took a cognitive test and it was found that my cognitive functioning speed is slightly lower than average  The peak of my illnesses has passed  but I still have not gained the state of cognitive functioning I previously had   What is a "HR of 160"   Personally  I agree  But this is really more about her this time  If she wants something to show her friends  maybe a compromise is in order  A cheaper ring maybe  Yup that's worse Not so much structured advice however here's some suggestions you may find helpful     Do some simple reading into body language  this was you can portray yourself in a friendly  open manner     Confidence  This will gain rapport with people much faster and increase your appeal to people  Have trouble with confidence  Fake it  It's really that simple  you fake confidence until it becomes natural     Find people with similar interests  This is the foundation for a friendship and a lot easier to get along with people who share the same interests     You're in high school  that's a great social situation where others are also learning social skills so don't get hung up if you get knocked down a few times      Make a lot of connections with people from different groups around school  you'll find having a positive reputation and network great in your social endeavour   These are some simple tips that will help you out I hope  if you need any further explanation I invite you to ask  Best of luck      Yisssss    https   media tenor co images a81c1a0802ff33f8e4b781a833d4b8b1 raw  Anorexia Nervosa has one of the highest morbidity rates when it comes to mental illnesses  so it's definitely not something I think you should drop  However  you need to know that  should anything happen  it is not your fault  You are not responsible for your sister's health  but you can help    What are some possible reasons that she interprets the things you say as calling her stupid   People are so cold hearted  I obey no law that stands to prevent me from helping any life  human or animal  back to health  Tell a vet a friend gave you the bird and you noticed it has a limp  Quite sure it's not illegal to have a pet pigeon  Like an apathy or numbness  I felt like that for several months after starting my current medication  It almost felt like my emotions were erased  bad and the good  Like I wasn't really excited or phased by anything at all  Like I couldn't feel anything  But apparently that was "normal" when your body and mind readjust to the meds  and then that numbness just went away after a long while  It was a "phase"  and it was even scary at times  There was depersonalisation  dissociation  and detachment going on  I sometimes self harmed just to feel something  and to convince myself that I existed at all   What helped me to deal was to just focus on some small goals  making tiny progress towards them  These included learning more about mental health  the specific disorders and symptoms  self help  It fed into my need to understand and to analyse  Perhaps over analyse  but I felt like knowledge is power and that while I couldn't feel I was making progress  intellectually I knew that this counted as progress in its own way    It gave me a sense of control  a grasp on it all   Also getting out of your own head is a healthy thing to do  I started reading  never used to do that much before   to kind of live someone else's life for a moment  listen to someone else's thoughts  I took loooong  silent walks in the English countryside with my dog  not really thinking about anything  The fresh air was good for me  and it counted as exercise   I was feeling so numb and empty  I went on a rampage of chaos manufacture  Argued with my boss and got myself fired  broke up with my boyfriend for no good reason  took a year of medical leave from my studies  left the country  I needed a shake  an earthquake to gain my senses back  I don't recommend this route  clearly  but that's how it was for me then   Recently it's all been very very different   I feel intense emotions again  Go figure  but I feel medications and life events and having a long depressive episode all played a big part in it  Would gladly hear your thoughts  tl dr  It's called dissociation  It's a symptom of anxiety  You are not alone    It is something I relate to very much  It's called dissociation  not to be confused with dissociative identity   and it is something that everyone experiences once in awhile  although perhaps not to the extent of what you have been experiencing    It is often used as a coping mechanism for when your mind feels that it cannot handle what's happening  It is also often found in people with anxiety disorders  It feels absolutely horrid in a strange way  and I don't have advice for you  but just know that you're not alone  okay   Vegetables  fruits  nuts  seeds and legumes offer a complete nutritional profile  so there is no need in taking supplements  Also  most people in 2nd and 3rd world countries don't have much access to supplements and many still live well past 90  B12 is most likely the only supplement a plant based diet requires as most people wash their veggies and fruits and get rid of the B12 rich soil  You can get B12 from fortified nut milks or 1 small tablet a week  if people have access   Pigeons are filthy and potentially full of germs that are bad for people   Set him free and let nature take its course  Heyyy I have the exact same diagnosis as you  We're sick buddies now     May I ask   what is it that stops you from sharing what you've realised w  your psych   I think it does matter when and how often  though  Having an irregular eating schedule whereby you sometimes do not eat enough to last you the day may lead to starvation syndrome    But it definitely matters how much you eat   One huge question  why didn't they include the diagnosis of acute tonsillitis  which is how the indication for surgery is based on  look up Paradise Criteria    Please correct me if I completely missed it in the methods     While this question is interesting  don't interpret this as saying you shouldn't have a tonsillectomy   Somewhat analogous to saying   we looked at all people who had an appendectomy and found that they are still as equally likely to present to the hospital with gastroenteritis causing diarrhea as control  Do you have a counselor currently  Discuss this in session and request that he she call your parents and explain that you need their support and understanding  and that it is necessary for them to come in for psychoeducation and possibly family therapy  Your counselor should be happy to advocate for you in this way  No real username I hope you're getting the help you need  There you go again with saying "fuck off" to some poster who didn't anything to you   like some 16 year old boy   Aren't you in your 30's  Seriously  maybe you should work on your social anxiety instead of taking it out on other people online   You need to practice what you preach   You're so quick to scrutinizing other people's comments  yet you can't take it when someone responds back to you  Other people have the right to express their opinions  as long as it's not violating rules or causing harm to others  Why is it okay for you to say fuck off to people and act like the wizard of oz  Yet  other people can't say something that you don't agree with or like    You're making all of these assumptions about someone's post when you don't even know all of the facts of what that poster intended   Can you learn to read properly first and then ask questions about what some poster means     All the best to you and your social anxiety  If this is how you act in your 30's  I don't know what life looks like for you in your 40's or 50's   Awww me and my boyfriend were similar    we met and started seeing each other just weeks before his 20th birthday    we lost our virginities to each other  on the night of his 20th  While many cases are the result of confabulation  be it induced by a psychotherapist  it happens   it is possible that repressed memories do happen  A good example is PTSD  where victims tend to have a chunk of missing memory  especially rape  I'm thinking that it might be possible several missing chunks of memory has led to repressed memories of childhood abuse  What do you think  I may be wrong though haha   Happy New Year  I'm in CA and the sun came out for you today  I went to sleep alone and woke up alone and Sara   for some reason I wouldn't have it any other way    now  that may change   Take this time of solitude to reflect and really take in the beauty of this world  You are STRONG   Happy 2017  Let's change the world  I blog about mental health awareness  and my experience with illness  http   dinoclaire wordpress com  You stay out of it  Chances are she'll be less happy when she barely has money  If the guy isn't doing anything wrong then there is no hurry  Yes I definitely agree with you  If you're afraid that you can't afford or you don't want people to know  you can try online counselling    Make sure the site you go to is credible  though  Otherwise may do more harm than good   So why are some people who don't have those qualities invited out  I've met some mouth breathing morons who have nothing to add to a conversation being invited and part of a social group   I think part of it is just being at the right place at the right time  When the social group formed  that person was there and included  It doesn't matter if they're boring and just sit there like they're half retarded I think it's important that you don't blame yourself for having to take some time away  You are only human  We all have our limits  Visit a counsellor for it if you have to  or it might lead to health issues that will affect your marriage grealty    The idea of couple therapy sounds great  I was gonna suggest it too hahaaa   I'm from Belgium but I use the Dutch equivalent of it all the time  I just call every woman or man that I don't know ma'am or sir  It gets their attention and I can never be wrong  Unless they're around my age or younger  then it feels weird  Then I'll just shout "Ey"  TFW your "friends" said they were too busy to do anything last night then shared a video on Facebook of them all having a good time without you  Fuck my life  They're probably jealous  You do nothing  No one cares  May I suggest getting off of all social media  It's toxic to your health  and I never realized how bad it was until I got away  You spend your time looking at others' lives convincing yourself that because there's never any bad things they must have perfect lives  They don't  the bad shit is there bubbling under the surface where you can't see it  But you do see the unhappy aspects of your life  and when you compare that to an idealized or fake life online  it drags you down deeper  Get off the social media and get away   The hardest thing to learn about this is that you need to live your life for you and only because you want to  Screw what anyone else thinks or expects  Depression and anxiety actually have physiological  physical  causes   chemical imbalances  brain functioning  etc   If someone asks you "what is the purpose of your life "  how would you respond    What if they ask "who are you "  or "what's really important "  The thing that strikes me in your post is that there's no hint of a mention that meaning  values  or identity are on your radar at all   It seems to be entirely about your emotional cognitive state and the annoyance or upset about its volatility   But your mental state doesn't live in a vacuum  if you're healthy   It's part of a larger whole which includes how you understand yourself and your relationship to life and values    So the complete absence of any clue about your understanding of that stuff is itself a clue    I suspect that you just have no idea why you're here  and that emptiness is now expressing itself  If trouble was money  I'd swear I'd be a millionaire     Girl here  What OP said about being yourself is key imho  as lame and unhelpful as that sounds  I've always wanted to tell guys who flirt with me too much  not that it happens a lot  not trying to say I'm all that or anything  that if they just talked to me like a person and not a potential fuck they'd have a much better chance of getting to know me and getting somewhere with me  It's so awkward to try to hold a conversation when a guy's trying to spin everything into a compliment    Like  if you think my hair looks nice today  that's nice  but I'd rather talk about Captain America or whatever  man  Sorry for the long comment  this just hit a cord with me  Try not to get discouraged  it'll happen when it happens and that's okay  Good luck  Thanks  I hope the situation works out for you  Tbf  you can rid yourself of your problems through therapy and self actualization your whole life  Living out your youth to the fullest is great  but if you missed out there's still so many possibilities when you get older to have fun and be yourself Heart rate  Some people wouldn't admit who they're attracted to  I'm saying this because I have a preferred type that I'm into and it's not something other people agreed on  If your friend approaches younger guys and behaves nicely  as long as he doesn't do anything inappropriate  I don't think it would be such an issue  I'm not gay nor a male but I feel like the guy wants to hang out with people he likes in order to reach out about his sexuality  it's not always easy to find someone else who is gay and like you back   As for you brother  I think whenever he has a match and your friend comes to watch  you should come along  You could have quality bonding time with him and your brother too  Show some protectiveness as an older sibling would do  Then one day if you and your friend are more comfortable talking about relationships  ask him what he's into  have an insight on his feelings  Went how I thought it would  Approached girls at school library  Asked about what classes they were taking and majors etc  And they wanted no part of me  I don't even know why I did it  Most girls get approached alot and an unnattractive guy isn't worth their time  their just an annoyance  Hey  check out r anxiety if you haven't already  It's pretty active there and people are nice  I always find it helpful to talk to others with a similar experience   I also freaked out this NYE so don't worry  it's not just you  To me it's quite a high pressure social situation because it doesn't have the nice family get together atmosphere of Christmas and it's more adult  everyone's drinking  you're expected to be "fun"   ugh  So not a good environment for my self esteem    I found u Mike77321's comment similar to what I would say about this   sometimes I can turn my 'i feel anxious so must be scared' into an 'i feel buzzy and adrenaline is going  time to get excited ' and just tell myself I'm actually looking forward to the thing  For example before an exam I'll tell myself I enjoy exams  It weirdly works    If you're not doing all the standard stuff already  here's that advice too  see your doctor if you haven't already  Not just for meds but also for therapy if you need it  Think of last night as a symptom of the flu  it's nothing to worry about but you should keep an eye on how you are  see your doctor  make sure there's a plan for your mental health care  and get treatment   When you have been over the relationship for a while  it's not uncommon to not have much of an emotional reaction  It could be grief or you could just be emotionally ready to move on   Had this thought today  I just wish something would conveniently end my life already  I tried to keep my spirit up over xmas and new year's  Was even feeling a little better thinking that going into the new year might help me get motivated but nope  feeling like shit already  Just had the realisation that it's most likely going to be another year of dealing with this fucking burden that is my life  I'm just done with it all to be honest   Now in your text you are making me think of another problem of depression   cognitive bias that maintain the symptoms What you think of yourself  your idealisation of your past self  and the just below average results can be bias that maintain the depression and be a trigger for future episodes     We really need new assessment tools  Ahh yes  I never thought of that before   Just give her time  I think the best thing to do is give her some time   space  Respect her and understand her decision  There's nothing more worse than ramming   forcing it down her throat  Good luck I hope you both get back together if that's what you really want  Why do you feel so  The worst is when you see people that you think you could really connect with getting paired off with others  Like people who have similar interests or relatable personalities but they'll just never be interested in you  Feels fucking awful  I know the feeling   sigh      I got strep every 6 8 weeks growing up like clockwork  I bet I had it at least 15 times before age 9  I got my tonsils out that year and am now 23 years strep free  and I have better breath than most people with tonsils    Story of half my life  With the other half being people seeing a great big "SUCKER" sign over me and trying to use attraction to steal my money     Edited because I can't spell "Story" while typing on my phone  I'm in health and fitness man  I see gyno every day from bodybuilders fucking up their gear  Gyno has very little to do with weight  When you are fat  you have higher levels of aromatase  which will cause gyno  Just because it is associated in that one situation  doesn't mean it is relevant here  That's like saying a girl with a fibroadenoma of her breast can't reduce it with losing weight  Well no shit  your problem isn't you are too fat   I don't have the personality for a relationship  romance intimacy  It sucks because we're biologically wired to want it but really it's just the normal people and I'm not compatible with the "normal" women out there   I completely agree with you in giving Ashley a day or two to contact you to make things right or you should contact her about reimbursing you   Also it sounds like Ashley is kind of a hot mess   in more ways than one  My other suggestion is to maybe not hang out as much with someone like that who doesn't have control of their own life  Those kinds of people always have problems that somehow have to become other people's problems  Not fun or endearing  Pigeons used to be the chicken of the world   We raised them to eat them   We bred them to breed faster and grow faster   We bred them to eat anything   Then we decided we liked to eat chicken more  and just like that  pigeons were abandoned   But those pigeons were perfectly suited to survive in our world   So they thrived as a feral animal    However people still eat pigeon  they just call it squab to make it sound fancy  and charge you for an exotic delicacy   Unfortunately the one thing they can't do  is untangle string and hair from their feet   The string or hair slowly tightens around their toe or foot and eventually amputated it  that's why there are so many birds that have mangled feet    So    feed your pigeon whatever you want   It'll eat it   It's foot is probably beyond help   If you decide to keep the bird  realize you're engaging in retaming a feral animal that used to be a common food and now is generally treated as a delicacy  This is my thinking  I want to die but not kill myself  Maybe car accident   Hey  I managed to read it all  I've restarted my life when I hit 20  I moved out of the city  left my family   friends behind and grew a small circle of friends by volunteering at my local cafe  I moved in my own place and met a girl who is now my gf of 2 years and we have a 1 year old with another on the way  I started with nothing and now I have so much  Moving away and leaving it all behind is big enough to restart your life  If you really want too I say go for it as you have so many oppurtunity to do what really makes you happy  I hope I stayed on the topic here   Thanks  I hope so too  Happy new year  Being a FIFTH wheel hurts so much    Doesn't really help that I don't like any of my "friends" and just circle around them out of convenience  I guess normies notice those things    You didn't feel committed to a relationship  so you didn't feel a sense of loss when it ended  Plus  if it ended on bad terms  it wouldn't be strange to feel a sense of relief that it was over anyway    There's nothing wrong with you  it seems like you might have 'settled' for those guys  like shrugging and saying 'why not '  instead of waiting for a relationship with someone who would make you feel excited and proud to be in a relationship with  It's not bad to think of those experiences as learning  learning what you'd like in a relationship  in a partner  what you like about yourself  etc    If you haven't met a guy that you'd be ecstatic to be asked out by  then that doesn't mean you're gay  Especially if the thought of sex with a guy turns you on  It just means that no guy has yet met your standards  Conversely  if you know of a woman who you'd be passionate about dating  then you might be gay or bi  I actually do have dogs  not technically emotional support animals  but they do provide me with a lot of emotional support  Ironically they wont sleep with me  So not looking forward to this  I start back on Tuesday  Luckily I go early in the mornings so it's not as bad  usually  But there is a noticeable difference and I fuckin hate it   Language is the core of all things  Focus on beoming more literate  Read things  fiction or non fiction  The process of reading will expand your language skills and knowledge of topics  There really is no other answer that will give you better results    The kids who start school knowing how to read already will have infintely better lives than the kids who didnt have parents teaching them anything  This fact extends throughout life  Never stop reading   As an adult your time may be better spent reading news  or articles on information    One thing i do every week  on monday  I go to lists like  this one  https   en wikipedia org wiki 2016 in science   I look at the most recent discoveries that have happened since the last monday  and i learn about them  Sometimes not much happens in a week  sometimes major things are discovered and i will spend the time learning  Mainly for my own interest  but i also know a hell of a lot of stuff now  and without sounding too full of myself  people always enjoy talking with me because i talk about fascinating things they dont know  Maybe that makes me sound intelligent  maybe it would make you sound intelligent er  too  I've come to the conclusion that a lot of what we're struggling with here is just basic evolution  Those who got the most in the genetic lottery   looks  personality  confidence  skills etc   will always just win out over the rest of us  I keep seeing my friends and family pair off and I keep wondering what the hell I'm doing wrong  I mean I'm a pretty nice guy or so I keep getting told and I'd like to think I'd be a genuine partner to someone else but nope  33 years old and alone as fuck because apparently I'm not really anyone's "type"   Mom  dad  wait for it     And my aunt   I mean  that's kind of why I'm here    I guess I'm kind of hoping that somebody knowledgeable in this field will find my post   "Can't Change It Back To Numbers House" I'm sorry for your loss  please feel free to PM if you need someone to talk too   Congrats  I wonder what it must feel like  I really really want to  but I'm not going to see him in person until late March at the earliest  I don't know if I can wait that long  but I also don't want to be he person who tells him something like this through text etc   Housey McHouseface sounds wonderful  I understand where you're coming from  I too owned my own business at 21  I bought into a franchise  and was everything from the janitor to the CEO  There was no getting away from work  I literally drove work home every evening  The pressure was too much for me  and I realized that  at least then  I was not ready to run a business  After admitting that to myself  I terminated the franchise and went and got a job    I've moved up pretty rapidly in the company I work for  and I've learned a lot from my boss and his boss  The thing that stands out the most is the amount of items the delegate  They've surrounded themselves wit people they trust  give us tasks and expect them to be completed  They do not micromanage  This leaves them free to do their own work    You will figure this out  you didn't make it to where you are without knowing what you're doing   Offer them gum or a mint after they finish their coffee  Either they take the hint or they say something about it  then you could jokingly say something like  "Yeah  your breath stinks " You're protecting yourself to avoid pain and upset  but that protective wall is like a cage  and you start to behave like a restless predator within the walls    ready to slash at someone who comes too close to your bars   This is just no way to live   Life starts when you value freedom more than comfort  LOLOL i love word play I am not sure how to process this    thank you  It sounds like he thinks sex is a big part of relationship  and it sounds like you two have multiple issues to work through with that  You need to have a serious conversation about these things  trying to brush it under the rug is just going to make it blow up on you later  Stop drinking if this is how you act when you drink  You know it's wrong to intimidate people when you are sober so do not drink  People do not deserve to be scared because you think that is a way of solving a problem  This should be a wake up call for you to look at yourself and see about taking care of this before you lose another Hannah  Peace How many times a day do you shower  Avoid them   Thanks  I figure by the first few weeks of her having to deal with me in a few classes  it might help things  In a month or two I'll see if things have changed  At least you went outside  I don't leave my apartment unless it is for work  How are you doing  Doesn't sound good  You can try to call a docter if the symptoms are unbearable  try also some pills so your     will slow the work  Drink some coca cola against the puking   I hope for you it's a little bit done right now I agree with you  sigh  Please direct me to the 'what' you are  fucking     I hope for the same  brother  Just the thought of it fills me up with warmness   If I do I will let people know  winning the lottery won't give me what I want Numberless Manse   I got a few issues  I could stand to go up a cup size or two  lose a few pounds from the stomach or thighs  But I look fine  I look like a normal  healthy human woman  It would not be bizarre for someone to find me attractive  For the first time in my life  I'm pretty much okay with how I look   You are beautiful  Inside and out  I hope you know that  Stay a happy little sushi roll      Try to hang out in a bar and have a talk  Go travelling alone or meet people on meetup com  Be outgoing and in seek for meeting new people   As you say making friends in your earlier years are easier  You are still young and a ton of memories ahead   Go for it I'm so ugly I can't be considered human  I'm a monster walking amongst mankind  that is why I will never have any friends and will never get a girlfriend  Hey  if you see some fat and flabby folks looking lost  be kind  They need this  Help them get started right  if you can  Chances are most of them won't last  but you can help ensure that the ones who do are the kind you don't mind sharing a gym with   This is a good point  Sex shouldn't be your only priority   I don't get it  You're saying their pussies dry up around you   Ive never been in your exact situation  but whatever emotions that you are feeling go ahead and feel them   You're are through something that is going to effect the rest of your life   surround your self with positive people and do your best not to numb yourself with drugs and alcohol I promise it will only make things worse    so in other words its a vicious cycle  you can't kiss anyone on new years because you're lonely  you're lonely because you can't kiss anyone on new years  Sorry  I meant heart rate  i'm terrible for doing that  You can talk to people here though  I'm sure some can relate  How  They will see me and find where ever I am  So is it looks  confidences  skills     What's your weakness   You are horrible  get a shittier apt you succubus Talk about a self fulfilling prophecy  the only way to starve is to not eat enough  it may be hard to eat enough if you do only eat once a day though  Everything is definitely starting to make sense for sure  now it's just slowly working on fixing the things that made me so depressed  You're right  things definitely won't be perfect  but as long as I'm not over stressing the situations I think I'll do alright  The adrenaline rushes in life will always be my favorite parts    Thank you seriously for taking the time  it's very appreciated  This thread has left me with open minded again with the new year rolling in  Weird how today's the new year and I woke up feeling no negativity like I used to  I hope this year will be a good one  and I'm here to talk to as well   Happy New Year     Yeah  true  Good points  I'll take this into account  Appreciate it    Just walk away  So you want a friend in real life  Online work for you  Haha New group of friends who have similar interests to mine   Wow  They are huge bitches  Yes  they help with social skills issues  If your problems are caused by an underlying disorder  you will be diagnosed and treated  If you're just bad at social skills  they will still help you  Maybe they'll send you to classes  Or they'll help you be more confident or whatever the issue is  I would recommend visiting one  At least you'll know if you have a disorder and you will get help  Keep in mind they can't make magic  though  Good luck  OP Lol at your cat trying to share your breathing air  But I understand it's a problem  You'll have to keep gently re positioning the cat  maybe so she is leaning over your shoulder or her head is against your neck   One of my cats likes to lay on my chest and when I first got him  he would get as close to my face as he could and put his arms around my neck  then knead my neck with his claws  A bunch of times in a row  I kept my hands up on my chest by my face so he would have to lay a little farther down  Sometimes he would just leave rather than lay in a second choice spot  but it wasn't long before he learned that he can lay on me happily a little farther down and accepted it    Good luck  And if you win  you can also officially claim the title 'Powerballer'  Because when we ball  we ball guud   self compassion principles sometimes feels like I'm lying myself  We all lie to ourselves pretty frequently  Fake it til you make it is a sound strategy sometimes  Pretend to be compassionate to yourself frequently enough and eventually it'll actually happen   tend to get stuck with CBT at the column where you have to come up with all the reasons why the sad anxious depressive thought you are thinking about yourself is true  So skip that column  do the other bits about why it isn't true google some sort of bird rescuer group in the area   there usually are always people who devote their loves to saving birds Yeah I have a counselor  Thats a good idea  I think you have me confused with someone else  But yes  you should probably reach out to this Jeffrey person   Thank You very much for your reply  It definitely helps  Happy New Year   a kid who had bullied me for two years so bad I wanted to quit college  and occasionally contemplated suicide  At this party  I was so excited to be with my crush I was ready to bury the hatchett and pretend he had never made my life hell  even though he never apologized  At the party  my crush and my bully made out on the sofa I was sitting on  Then they went off to have sex  I drank a lot and wandered back to my room to cry    this was too hard to read  man  It made me really really sad  it's just another proof how fucked up and unfair this world is  nobody gets what they deserve    From what you wrote you seem like a pretty normal person who does lots of activies with people  attending parties and has dreams  I lack all of those things  So could your problem be just looks  I don't know  do you have any deformities  Is it possible you're just surrounded by assholes who don't cherish you  I just don't see the reason for people treating you this bad  Possibly   You can have a mental ailment which stops you from forming memories properly   in which case you may not be helpable   However  you may just not be skilled at forming memories   Memories are formed by two things   emotional attachment and repetition   Your brain chooses to remember things related to strong emotions on the assumption that those are the important things   The easiest way to remember things better is to use repetition   When you are introduced to someone  immediately repeat their name   Say "nice to meet you NAME"   That helps significantly with remembering names  I'm sure the life you have lived has led you here  Just putting it out there  that the life I live has shown me the exact opposite  My friends rapidly change  I still know my buddies from high school  but the friend I spend the most time with changes nearly monthly based on what's happening  I can't see people meeting you  holding up a list of their current friends  and seeing where you fit in haha  If a random guy came up to me at the gym and asked for me to help him  like has recently happened  I spend 2 hours a day with him  Could say he is my best friend at this point  even though we have only known each other for a month  and have lived very different lives until this point  We share a common goal at this point  and have bonded over it  It's as simple as that  Find people with common goals  I am so sorry you lost your friend  I know there is little I can say  but maybe this will help   When good people find a way into your heart  they live there forever  Get an adult dog  not a puppy    Puppies are tons more work   Get a dog that is not too large   Dogs you can physically pick up and control are easier   Go to a shelter and meet the dogs   Spend some time with them before you choose one   Don't just choose the first that runs up to you   I am sure there is a subreddit about dogs or adopting dogs that can provide more advice  Think through why this bothers you   Are you scared you got infected with something   Is there some reason this should cause lasting trauma   Or was it just a shock  We can't tell you if it is an actual date  only he can  Or "Number Twelve" but replace with the actual number it would be  ask on the subreddit for your city   Each city is different Why does it matter that they are black  How old are you   maybe he likes you and wants to fuck  give it a go     I guess that's a start  Thanks     I think you're being used  If you want someone to watch your dog  at least you should tell them in advance  And give them dog food or money for dog food   I don't know what's a good thing to do here  but don't let this continue check out a learning languages or german subreddit for advice Get this girl to hook you up with her friends  Sounds like you're already in with her  You win the approval of one of them  you've won all of their approval  Congrats buddy  That is really huge   There was absolutely nothing sexual involved at all so nothing to worry about with infections etc etc  Literally just an unanticipated split second feel    I think it was just the sheer shock of the situation and the fact that I started 2017 by grabbing it by the balls  literally   What kind of house is it  Is it large  Is it on some property  Anything notable about its construction or the land it sits on  Any interesting geographical features nearby    These things are important when naming a house  because if you're inland on a meadow and you call it "Crestwater" or "Eagle Heights"  that would be simply inaccurate and strange    Give us the necessary information to help you  Are certain wildlife common to the area     My house actually has a number  but I named it anyway  in my head  it's an unofficial name  because I love the idea of houses with names  Ours is on a hillside and we get a great view of wildlife  including deer  in our backyard  so it's "Hartsview"  This is so ridiculous I can't even tell if you're trolling  No   Escalating with someone who is going to vomit will not go well   Talk to the person who threw the party to find out who she is and how to contact her  Sorry to hear that That girl must be a psycho  Then the shock will wear off Wut If they didn't tell you  they must care how you feel about it   Talk to them   Don't just throw away friendships like that  Can I just say  you did a great job playing Greg in 8 Mile    EDIT  C'mon guys  you can't tell me he doesn't look like Greg Buehl  Weed is too illegal and too expensive  I have no idea where I'd get it anyway Wash your clothes and clean your bedroom  I'm not totally sure how much stuff you have in your bedroom  but by going thru some of your old belongings you may may not get a sense of nostalgia and you might even feel better  On top of that you say you don't want to get better but if you were truly content with being all of THIS then you wouldn't feel the need to get it off your chest  Soo build a routine for yourself    start by going on walks either super early in the morning or very late at night and try to use that time to think and look at new things  personally what I do is I drown out the world with music and I try to admire the stars  That's really the best you can probably do for yourself  Why don't you just actually make plans  You can't draw too many conclusions from what is presented here  That's not TOO too much to go on  but maybe "Sherwood Cottage"  or something do to with Maid Marian  "Mariansong"  Good luck with that  Every year i try and go to sleep before new year's a and its these people and their damn fireworks disturbing the peace and I cannot sleep at all  Worst of all  fireworks are illegal in the city limits yet  the law never gets enforced  Aww  yay  Congrats   happy almost birthday     Your inner monster came out a bit and roared last night  The monster didn't win  If so  you would've hit her face and not the wall  The red flags were already up for her when you blocked her from exiting the situation by putting up your hands on either side of her  All you can do is apologize  and not be that person that she thinks you are  Practice some emotional regulation techniques and become a better  Cheers m8  No matter how smart you are for your age  being a teenager is always the trickiest part of your life emotionally  you're trying to figure yourself out  your relationships and where you fit in with society  You're going to experience some measure of anxiety    If you feel like the loneliness and anxiety and mood swings are ACTIVELY fucking with your ability to live a day to day life and just being disruptive to any routine or chance you have at improving yourself or just being a person  THEN you need some professional help    Other than that  you're at a fragile  confusing part of your life  So is the girl you're so mad at  So are all your peers who are smoking or doing drugs or whatever  in fact  for them  it might be MORESO   So just   find a bit of comfort in that you're not alone in feeling like this  and just be good to one another  High school's a bummer as it is      I was at this psychologist for 2 months  Like 8 sessions   Calm down  no big deal   I mean what was the actual impact to you  Reading this felt very similar to a situation I went through last year   I was quite possessive of my friend and got jealous seeing her make an effort to go to drinks with her colleagues and do all sorts of things  I wanted her to invite me to things but she never did   she claimed it was because she knew I'd be uncomfortable but I'd told her before that I wanted to push myself  I think she didn't want me there dragging her back   She stopped contacting me and that made me even more upset  In the end I was the one who cut her off because I could tell that she didn't REALLY want to be my friend  she said that wasn't true but you don't go 1 year without contacting your so called best friend   Don't feel like you HAVE to help your friend  especially if you feel he is holding you back  You should be friends because you actually both like being around each other not because you have no one else   Otherwise you could both make a decision to meet up every so often and talk on the phone often  Before my friend and I broke up this is what we decided   we met up once a month on payday and we Skyped once a week  Our relationship got so much better and I actually felt like I had a proper friend   i dont think it would have hurt to casually ask for some kind of contact info before you left momentarily  in fact its the perfect opportunity  something along the lines of "hey i need to go check up on my buddies out back  ill be right back  but just in case i lose you  do you mind if i get your number real quick  really glad i met you tonight " pretty simple  if she says no you can move on  if yes  score  Yeah  Cascadia earthquake   At first it worried me but if I didn't get killed right away  I could just focus on survival like our brains were designed to do    Happy birthday  Hope that is sincere haha yeah she did  next ones gonna be your mum  then ur sister   Tough luck buddy    you're gay now    Maybe you and your friend will get together  I suppose it is like quitting anything when you are ready you are ready    Good luck Hon  I'm proud of you  It takes a lot of strength to free yourself from a toxic person   hugs  Your friend is purrrdy  I know exactly how you feel  I'm always turned to for advice for everything  whether I'm able to do it or not  I've never been in any committed relationship ever and I have the same thoughts  The thought always crosses my mind that if I came out  closeted gay here  then I may find someone  but I just don't see that happening  What has really helped me is finding a suitable best friend  I guarantee nothing is better than having someone there for you when you're down and you're there for them  It's like a special bond that will never break  I got a new phone a few weeks ago  That's what my message screen has looked like the whole time    thanks  I was thinking of a shelter dog anyway but spending time with them all hadn't occurred to me cheers  You would have to start a subreddit or ask a mod of a current sub to put you on as a mod of their sub   No  All you gather from this is that your cousin can't imagine being attracted to  Which  unless you want to f    your cousin  is a goos thing  She let you stick your face between her legs so yeah she was attracted and yeah other girls will be attracted to you over the course of your life  As cliche as it sounds  the main thing that attracts girls is confidence  Maybe she was desperate  Who cares  He is obviously jealous  The same reason most people here hate on attractive people that could be the nicest people in the world for all they know  That pain turns into jealousy for those who don't feel that pain  Congrats on mucking her barn btw haha What did you want of them  Eggs are really good for birds in moderation  It's similar to a heifer eating her placenta after giving birth to a calf  Has lots of good nutrients in it   That said  a little wet cat dog food mixed with warm water will tide him over well too   I'm not sure what it's like where you are OP  but at a Clinic I used to work for it was policy to euthanize any injured pigeons to that were brought in  on the spot  due to disease prevention as they carry the equivalent to aids for birds  Did you do anything else stupid apart from drink too much  Thank you  As I wrote it  I thought 'of course you are being used ' but I know that if I turned them away next time  I'd second guess myself and feel guilty  So ty  Nope  Just fumbled around and acted like a slight retard who was laughing at everything  how can u prevent ur car getting stolen u cant change ur car lock right wow thanks for the advice man  and I will check out Mike Oldfield haha  I'm that friend who everybody ignores when I'm talking   story of my life   One I met on tinder and the other on another app that I can't recall  I don't really care what comes of girls when I meet them  if you're not meant to date then you're not meant to  but to be plain manipulative stringing me on  which I see as extremely disrespectful  isn't acceptable   Wow I'm very sorry about everything  and I appreciate your advice  I have another friend who is kind of in the same situation as me with the same people so we have been talking a lot  Thank you   Thank you for posting to  r helpmecope  While you wait for users to post and help you  please take a look at  the Wiki page  http   www reddit com r helpmecope wiki index  that

subreddit   message compose  to  r helpmecope  if you have any questions or concerns   I enjoy the work I do  I enjoy the freedom that money provides me in my life  Money is a goal in and of itself    dorngale  Interesting result googling that word   Brickey McRobinhood   happy new year to you too  and thank you for helping me out here  I know that this stuff happens when people get older too  but I don't wanna lose this friendship so I will try to talk to them   What do you expect when you stay home for 3 days without warning  You can screw over their entire schedule for that day  Yes  Ah  alright  Thanks    Well that seems a little off haha  I'm Canadian  but I lived in the states for 5 years for school  I can honestly say that the heavy majority were shitty people   compared to Canadians at least  Even though people were nice  they were often very inconsiderate  and felt compelled to brag about every accomplishment they ever had  I hated every second of being surrounded by them  Never considered living in America  I can undearstand your view haha  In my experience  the girls were much more pleasant than the guys though  I just never thought it was that relevant  or a byproduct of my psychotic features  I still stick to the old "I would rather cry in a GTR than a bike " If it's outside quiet hours  they won't take noise complaints  It's not illegal to be noisy in the daytime  You forgot to "take 5 showers brah"  Wow  I'm sorry to hear that  Your brother sounds like an extremely difficult person  Sometimes there is no other way to deal with difficult people than avoid them completely    If you want to fix this problem  there is one more thing you can do however  This might not be in the cards at the moment  but if you try  you may find success  I recommend you and he go to a counselor  It will cost money  but the counselor will basically let you have the conversation you wanted to have yesterday  and act as a referee of sorts  He she won't let your brother back you into a corner  He she will offer professional advice and other ways to heal this relationship  If you truly want to mend this relationship  and are willing to put in the work  I recommend it highly    Again  you may not want to try this  He is a difficult person  and sometimes there's no changing that  He's wronged you enough  and doesn't plan on changing anything  so dropping him may be your best bet   If you do leave your family  I recommend you tell your mother  and leave a note for your brother  Let him know he is the reason why you don't think you can associate with your family anymore  and that you tried to fix it    Again  I'm sorry it didn't work with the first method  I do highly recommend counseling  but it can be hard to do for some people  Good luck OP  Well  fuck  I am more doomed than I thought   r GermanPractice may help  Duolingo is also pretty good for practice and is free  unlike Rosetta Stone  I applied to Pizza Hut again last night but before then like 2 to 3 weeks ago If it's affecting your social relations negatively then it might be a good idea to stop doing it  Pizza Hut IHOP places like that It doesn't matter how you look if you don't know how to react when people try to talk to you  I have a number of severe mental disorders which prevents me from integrating with society like a normal person so it really does make it hard finding a relationship  let alone friends in general     Ah ok  Just realise they are just worried about you  Alcohol is damaging especially to a smaller younger body  and obviously alcohol can make you get into dangerous situations    Many people have done what you have  probably even your own parents    however you need to seriously listen to what they have to say because the world is a different place to what it was when I was young or your parents were young    My 'Advice' would be try and take an adult approach and discuss the situation  Maybe do a bit of research about why alcohol can get young people into trouble  then you would understand why they are both mad and worried  When you can understand why they would be angry and worried then you will be able to have an adult conversation with them about what happened and understand why it is a serious situation for someone your age to get very drunk   If you want to clear the air then maybe you will have to start the conversation and listen to what they have to say and see what you learn  Things will be ok after that i'm sure  Just the mere fact that I made out with someone and felt their balls without expecting it basically   Just a general shock to the system basically   Try it while you can  Don't be that 30 year old creep walking around the mall looking for victims  Alright  Thanks dude I appreciate it   Exactly  I had controversial shots to rid myself of mouth lesions  Worked perfectly  You can change the locks on your car   just go to a reputable mechanic  I'm impressed here  Gj I swear I'll remember the smile that came on my face when I read this  It's been wonderful having this conversation with you fellow Redditor  Have an amazing First   Can't you outsource your position and grow multiple business ventures at this point so you don't get too attached to one when it's not so good  The true skill is hiring the right person  maybe you're not a CEO person  that's ok  You gotta find someone who is  Your skill is the creation of the business  but running it is a different game   Then again this is advice from a 27 year old who hates her mediocre  low ish paying job  Thanks for the input y'all  I am in the same boat  I've found cashiers  waitresses etc have been a great low risk way to get used to talking to people  I'm going to try the same thing with smiling  too   She kind of made a dick move by not talking to you after you went with your "sick" friend  You had ever right to be mad  you just took it too far  Stop blaming yourself for what happened  you can't change the past  Let it go and forgive yourself but don't forget what happened  so you won't make the same mistake again   We all deserve to die  2girls1OP I'm so sorry  it might be hard  but you have to realize you are not alone  Many people live with HPV and herpes and it's not a dealbreaker for many relationships when it's honestly communicated and properly maintained  Lots of people don't have symptoms of either and yet still carry the STD  Silver lining is if it's HPV then it clears in 1 2 years by itself and every sexually active person by 30 yo gets it at least once  Both STDs are not blocked by condoms entirely because the skin is touching   Feel better and take care of yourself  3 Who laid the pipe  He must have been showering when it happened  Lynda com offers a subscription based service to learn anything  Programing  business skills  social I can reccomend this website for further reading    https   speakoutloud net   I agree with you   Sorry not everyone can just drink and drink and feel dandy especially the next morning  They need to cut it out  to be honest most people seem to forget most of what is said  Research showed that only 50  of what is told when meeting a doctor will be remembered  So I think it might be less of a problem then you might think   But to fix it  try to repeat the things you want to remember  You can store around 7 things in short term memory which can be directed to long term so you will always forget parts  but chose the important parts  Tell people that you often forget things  to make them understand    If it is a big problem in your day to day life you might consider seeing a doctor and talking about what it could be  If you have already gone to a doctor you can also try a psychologist  He she may know what is going on  You might just have other things going through your head or adhd or add  Then again  let a psychologist decide these things  because with the information you give me it is hard to really draw conlusions    Remember  most redditor are not doctors  always visit your family doctor before chosing therapy   Congrats on your success  That takes a lot of courage to put yourself out there like that  You are clearly a strong person  and I can't see you being FA One of the hardest things for someone to do is admit that something is wrong  I hope everything works out for the best for you  I agree with  u TheModernLoki in that good language skills are the crux of it  I'll address the 'intelligence' part   there are many books and articles in this sub which already deals with the social and delivery part of this   You fix this by changing your behaviours  An intelligent person constantly and forever looks to improve themselves and expand their knowledge  Learning never stops  not even for a day  My mantra has for a long time now been "Do the things you have to do to be the person you want to be"    This works on several levels  firstly it starts your change with an emotional desire or vision  Then this allows your brain to rationalise your sudden changes in behaviour and motivates you to eventually cement new habits  To improve intelligence  surround yourself with nothing but intellectually stimulating media  I mean move as far away from media with weak language skills and towards media with strong language skills  We are social creatures and we absorb behaviour and language from those around us     If you like TV  stop watching adverts  soap operas  cheap laugh sitcoms  anything with a laughtrack etc  and engage with better quality content     If you like Reddit  start subscribing to  better subs  http   www refinethemind com reddit mind 44 smart subreddits    and remove the default subs     If you like Youtube  subscribe to as many engaging Youtube channels as possible  and unsubscribe to those cheap puns vlog channels  If clickbait pops up as suggested  click on the grey dots and select 'I'm not interested'  Throw in a few philosophy channels  e g   TheraminTrees  https   www youtube com user TheraminTrees    Sam Harris  https   www youtube com channel UCNAxrHudMfdzNi6NxruKPLw      If you read  subscribe to engaging magazines or absorb good books  no trashy pop novels      If you read news articles  learn how to become critical and a skeptic  Learn the scientific method for deducing things  including a bit of statistics  For anything you care about believing  always hunt down the original source and assess its methodology     If you like movies  stop watching those with cheap flicks and quick laughs and look out for those with better storylines and more serious actors     Listen to thought provoking audiobooks or podcasts each night   One of the best ways to develop a good understanding of something is to teach it to others  Tutoring or volunteering is great for this   Find a way to interact with intellectual people  Join a group  a quiz team  or whatever it might be  Successful people tend to surround themselves with smart people   There are good books on memory and recall out there to access those interesting facts  We know that some parts of the brain continue to produce neurons into adulthood  including the hippocampus  Grow that part of your brain by practicing memory and recall   Never stop learning  not even for a day  friends come and go  get the crappy ones out of your life to make room for the good ones  or none at all        The video below posted earlier on Reddit and it was helpful to me in knowing how to smile at people  Also I agree with the others  practice   https   www youtube com

that  sounds like she would be lucky to have you  It will probably be hard to be rejected by her  but you can't say you won't provide what she needs better than the guy she ends up with  If you are too scared to talk to her about this  that is fine  Own that excuse  Saying it's because she doesn't deserve you is bullshit  Unless you're a rapist or some other dark shit like that  Then ya  if you care about her  fuck off  But really  limiting this girl's options for her  without her knowledge  does not show you care   One thing first     I know this shouldn't bother me as much as it currently is since ultimately I passed       but it genuinely does   IMO  it's a good thing that you're bothered by intellectual bulimia  Facts can be useful and engaging  if  they help you understand the world  but memorizing facts simply because you have to is an exercise in futility  Yet  many educational systems teach memorization rather than understanding    And higher education is filled to the brim with people who are content that way  which we can't fault young people trying to find a place in this world for   but it's still sad  I think you very much  should  be bothered by this and it's a good thing that you're yearning for more   Now  onto the issue   u TheModernLoki makes some smart points  Reading helps being well versed in three ways     you gain knowledge  It's far easier to have an intelligent conversation if you're informed  plain and simple     you broaden your vocabulary in certain special areas  Knowing technical terms can come in handy     you broaden your general vocabulary  In other words  you become generally more well versed  This is probably the most noticeable and important change  Being able to express your ideas precisely is probably one of the most important life abilities  Notice that there's a difference between  passive  vocabulary  i e  words that you understand  and  active  vocabulary  words that you actually use   The latter can only increase through practice   Notice that there are many ways to be an interesting conversationalist  Personally  I don't keep up with news   there are a couple of arguments against it  but that would be out of the scope of the discussion for now   but important developments find their way into my personal thought bubble anyway  Devouring some non fiction might not be a bad idea  but a well written novel  a classic  heck even influental literary smut can be a source of enlightenment  Ever thought about what "Fifty Shades of Grey" can tell you about the way its readers think and what they like  dream of  fantasize about    So read  And watch  and listen and most importantly  practice  That requires an amazing amount of strength   It doesn't seem that way now  but you are strong   I am pulling for you   I know it sounds corny  but every day I will think about you and send you all the positive energy I can muster   Good luck to you  Tough choice  First off I don't think you should just throw in the towel on your math courses  You can pass those exams  Get your ass to the math lab and do it everyday  Or take your trip  I think you should do whatever you will regret less because you can't do both  We only get one shot at life  Stick it out and pass those effing classes or take that trip  It's your life but YOU CAN do either   Hey  wow  good job  That's extremely impressive  even normies find cold approaching terrifying  I think next time  after you add them on Facebook  you should ask them out on a date  I definitely think you're close to getting a girlfriend if you keep this up  I'm starting to realise tinder is a tool to affect your self esteem  If you're a woman  it's a huge ego boost  If you're a guy below 8 10  it's just going to make you feel bad about yourself    I probably get a match about once a month or so  and that's using it every day  It's just not worth the effort   This logic makes zero sense  Because if loneliness is guaranteed for not kissing  then your never getting a kiss the following New Years  At some point everyone was kissless during a New Year's Eve  And not everyone is lonely  Superstitions are one thing  but they have to have logic behind them  First  make sure you have a place to sleep  keep your stuff  shower  and charge your phone  If that's a shelter in the area  start looking now because they're probably pretty full up given the season  Also  if you do stay in a shelter  keep a close eye on your stuff because otherwise it'll get stolen  If you have friends or family members that are willing to take you in  be as polite as possible and try not to stay too long in one place  Clean up after yourself and then some  Try to help wherever you can so as not to over stay your welcome    Once your immediate safety is handled  your  1 priority is to find a job  Any job  Anything that brings in income   Fast food sucks  but if you work your ass off and always take shifts it's easy to get promoted  Finding something in stocking warehouse is also a good entry level start  If this means you put off school until that's stable  that's okay  A delay doesn't have to be a forever thing  Once you have an income  find a room to sublet on Craigslist and build up from there   This is a shitty situation  and I'm sorry you're in it  You're going to have to grind for a while  but it's not impossible to get out of it  Good luck  OP  Why understanding  If you want to change the locks and provide them with a key it shouldn't matter should it  i dont think its self esteem honestly  we have talked about it  but he says its just all the stress were under right now  i want to be understanding but i also want to resolve this  i guess its the stress but one cant help wondering if its because of me  you know  obviously you all dont know every detail  but with what ive said do you think its wise to stay in this relationship and hope he changes  the emotional part   and to answer the emotional part i guess has been going on for about 4 years  and the lack of interest in sex for like a year and a half  when do you know its over  I think the best response is just "Thanks  but no thanks   I don't see a platonic relationship working out between the two of us " It doesn't sound corny at all  it's nice to hear and it is reassuring  Thank you for your kindness stranger  it means a lot   Amen I'm sure you girls get responses like  this   https   i imgur com PQ0t5pW jpg  all the time    s almost any cat  We are both KHV and completely FA   I went on a date with a girl and we did some sexual stuff  ate her out but still a virgin   Probably lifting the shower too  The same thing happened to me for a while  My brother noticed it and told me that I was always the one making the plans within my small friend group  we were friends for about 5 years   For a while over the summer  I stopped making plans to do stuff  to see if they would step up and plan something  Nope  instead they would put on snapchat how bored they were  It took a lot of thought but I decided to cut them from my life  I'm alone more often now but I've come to terms with that  Wasting my time and energy on people who don't care was frustrating  This might not work for you but it is an option you can do   but ill stand in the garden with you   youre not alone  things will get better   Some land lords and people in general  are unreasonable assholes  Depending on the state OP lives in  he could be held responsible for whatever happens to that apartment  Odds are if the landlord decides to be difficult  OP would end up spending a lot of time and some money to get his name cleared and damages to be settled  If I was the land lord I'd go out and buy the locks for him  But not all people wouldn't even be decent enough to allow him to change the locks  It also depends on how strict OP's contract is  I would call the cops  But that's just me  Cats are awesome  You sound awesome too   Though there's a good likelihood she will deny it to the police  you should call and give them the pictures  There should be a paper trail of his abuse with authorities even if it doesn't lead to charges or conviction initially  And an officer may be able to give her resources to get out   Unfortunately  there isn't a best answer for this situation  specifically because she doesn't want to get out of it  But calling the police might give her an opportunity  Me  There was this time with a friend     Cousin  Don't you say you have never had any friends   Me  You know what I mean  people I play videogames with that don't really like me but get mad at me if I don't call them friends  I have that small discussion almost weekly  I've been told to get  Witcher 3 several times now lol  Do I need to play the others to know what's going on   Also I have overwatch and I need don't really play it  I can playshare it if you want  They are sooooo cute   That's the best kind of cuddle pile  Good luck OP  I know exactly what its like to have that breakdown moment and ask for help  You got this   The downside is the good thing to me lol  I don't have much of a life  MMOs sorta help with that  I have no friends  Gotta have

thank you for your words kind stranger Thank you  I really didn't mean to insult anyone and I'm sorry if I made anyone feel bad     It's true  I've god kinda weird point of view on these things in general and starting by just seeking help is a huge step  too     Thank you for reading  Thank you  It's nice to know I'm not alone in feeling the way I do  even when it is such a lonely place to be  I wish you the best in this new year and I hope that it gets easier for everyone who feels this way   No  you dont  Plenty of trans people never have any surgery  You don't do anything to "become" trans you just are  Being transgender just means you feel like you were born in the wrong sex's body in most cases  "I wish I had been born a pretty girl" seems pretty obvious to me  I'm an eighteen year old trans girl who started hormones a few months ago and doesn't really do penetrative sex    THe pickle jar is a joke  Trans women take an anti adrogen that causes salt cravings if they are on hormone replacement therapy  My major is Management Information Systems and hopefully I can obtain my degree in another 2 years   Good luck to your goals as well  I've tried learning guitar myself but I'm not much of the musician   Good luck to you as well  It's definitely a good goal to start eating more healthy  I know for myself I should definitely completely cut out fast food and cut down on eating out   That would be too straightforward  I want to give a sarcastic or kinda cool reply    Thanks   Hugs to you   Predators are truly evil  and you didn't deserve that  wooowwww I'm actually in this same situation except she didn't even respond to me when I said happy new year loooool   pls kill me   This really made me think about it  I'm accepting my self in a certain way  even that inferiority  as long as it's not stoping me from living  I think I just answered myself  that I should really find some help     Thank you  I always set goals to loose weight but I loose motivation  I would love to get a trainer but I just don't got the money   But good luck to your goals  Before I start  here is a search on pubmed for mindfulness  I just want you to see how much research in this area is exploding  https   www ncbi nlm nih gov pubmed  term mindfulness  Its called dissociation when its unwilled  harmful  and misunderstood and called mindfulness when it is initiated  beneficial  and understood  At least this is what it seemed to me  I went through some unique circumstances that left me dissociated and perhaps I am still a bit so but it is enjoyable rather than disturbing   Unfortunately  mindfulness is really a subsection of meditation  Which means its quite difficult to find good info on because of ten thousand years of cryptic motherfuckers accidentally obscuring things  If you are interested  here are the better resources I've found     Mindfulness in plain english  https   www amazon com dp B003XF1LKW ref dp kindle redirect  encoding UTF8 btkr 1

it for a long time    Let me be clear   this doesn't stop the dissociation  I never found a way to do that  It just changes your perception of it  However  perception is reality and dissociation is no longer a problem for me   The reality is that you ARE a spectator to your emotions  If you can get that out of your head then thats all well and good and you won't need to pursue mindfulness  My anxiety riddled mind hyperfocuses on anything that bothers me and therefore the only path was through it   Anxiety medications are effective but the side effects can disturb your quality of life  That doesn't mean I am against them  You can be too distressed to pursue effective solutions to your problems  Popping a pill to fix that so that you can actually do so is wise  as long as you don't view them as a permanent solution if other remedies are possible  Take the medicine  feel better  work on yourself and your problems  handle them  come off the medications  Are your parents irrational  Can't you present a case  and reach some sort of compromise  I'm not sure what they could say that you couldn't find an easy solution for  "Hey  neighbor  Seems one of your guests took a toll on my garage door last night  Can I trouble you to hose it down today "  So even having non asian women friends are off the table for you   You made your bed  now lie in it  You chose to date Phil with his

effective than VA care    But they aren't  http   www herc research va gov include page asp id va vs non va  In addition  the VA loads many public health initiatives into their costs   For example  the overwhelming majority of providers in the US are trained by the VA   They are one of the biggest clinical research entities ever known to humanity   Responsible for developments such as the pace maker   2  You claim most US citizens can just switch health insurance providers without impediment   This is not not true  it usually requires they also switch their job   3  You claim the worst

business at a young age is very possible if you have the right skills and motivation  Good luck to you  Honestly  I think this is an issue that needs to be spoken about more   You'll have to figure out if you can stand being miserable with your bf for what could be years while you cheat and possibly feel guilty or if you want to move out and find a cheaper place    Personally  I think life's too short to be miserable and both you and this guy deserve better  But that's just my opinion  Good luck  Go to a psychologist  Good work  asking for help is often one of the most difficult steps to take and is definitely a sign of strength    Don't know if this helps  but remember that parenthood is a joint effort  There might be certain things you can't handle right now with your 1 year old that your husband can  but isn't that a good thing if you think about it  You helping each other out  There will be things only you can handle in the future    And 1 year olds are difficult  They can be monsters  I don't know a single parent with a 1 year old  especially not the first one  that rides on pink fluffy clouds  so to speak    They all love their kids  but they all say it's "sooooo goooood to finally get out for a while"   Honestly is it that much better to be the 25 year old creep  I don't feel it is  I mean idk  You'll only get lucky if you put yourself out there    onto some roads  I thought superstitions have no logic to them  I was thinking starting young would be better since I don't have children or a SO   sure might not know enough at a young age but by the time I'm older I might not be able to do it thanks   Got to be a homeless shelter somewhere nearby  Find it and take him there  This guy is not your responsibility  The shelter will have resources and a case worker to get him back on his feet  You can't do this and your relationship with your gf and child will suffer if you continue to try and "help" him  Look at it this way  how much has he changed in the last month  Probably not much  Do you see yourself taking care of this grown man for another month  Another year  At this point you are enabling him  He needs to take care of himself   They rarely compromise on things  Im at the point where im just conditioned to not even bother planning my weekend because i know they would not let me go out  Then my mom has the audacity to ask why i dont have friends or know how to dance    I do not have bipolar or mania  but I do have adjustment disorder with anxiety and depression that is easily triggered by my environment   The first telltale sign that things are really bad and I will need help is the feeling you described where the tears just wouldn't come  You want to cry but you can't  You stop crying  It's like there is an abyss between me and my ability to express despair   I am so glad you are getting a referral  Please do not let anyone  including yourself  talk you out of getting the help you need  Please do not falsely frame yourself as a failure or as a weak person  You are the strongest person  and have faced more odds than anyone who judges you could ever imagine   You may need hospitalization  Accept this  Accept that it can be a good thing  that you may get a break from all of the outside stressors in your life that are exacerbating an internal issue you are having  You cannot afford the real estate in your mind to worry about what anyone will say in regard to you getting treatment  People can be selfish and might say selfish things   But this is a fire that needs to be addressed now so that you don't burn down later   You have to survive right now in order to thrive later  And loving people is about making sure they survive in the hard times   There are times when you simply must look out for yourself if you want any ability to look after anyone else in the future  This may very well be one of those times  Do not be ashamed and do not consider this a failure  The is no such thing as failure by seeking out a means to succeed    It may take a while  and a doctor  to figure out if the hormonal changes of motherhood are playing a role in exacerbating a pre existing issue  Please know that you are not alone  this is common and you are not failing or weak   You are loved and you are important  You deserve to be well  I send you soothing thoughts and strength   I have been where you are let me tell you  I am strong  I sought help no matter what anyone said about me "abandoning them" or "sharing my private life" or "making them look bad"    fuck that  Get help and get better  You deserve to find peace and recover  may I ask whats so bad about telling him  Long distance isnt a death sentence  I started at like 63 kg early 2016  Half assed going to gym and didn't eat properly for shit  went up to around 66 kg  In september I started hitting the gym properly and followed the "diet" I described above and I'm currently at 78 79 kg with not too much fat gain  I didn't eat TOO much so this was pretty much a clean bulk  could have eaten way more and added more fat and muscle but I prefer staying relatively lean    I used to be even skinnier  58 kg 1 8m  so trust me I know how it feels to be skinny and thinking you can never put on weight  Your result could be better or worse than mine but as long as you focus on eating  eating and eating in addition to hitting the gym 3 times a week minimum you will not stay skinny  I promise you  Does it help if I lift too  That's   not a very good experiment  which is why I didn't include it   Soft drinks are not   really buffered in conditions for optimal enzyme activity   The fact that they used soda instead of aspartame water solution for that experiment is strange  The answer is simple friend  I have no doubt in my head that you heard her voice  and the fact that you heard it doesn't make you crazy  Anywhere from 5  28  of the population are like you  You want to know what's crazy though  The fact that you are letting that voice controll you  but it's still fine  and there are many ways to overcome it    Could this be souls being linked  Possibly  I don't have much experience in this field  but anything is possible friend  I highly recommend seeing a psychiatrist  They know you aren't crazy  and they can help you learn ways to not let her voice control you  They may also prescribe medication  to help you take back your mind  and use it for yourself  without her voice dominating everything you do  Medication is definitely the best route for you here  What you heard was very real  You aren't crazy  A psychiatrist can help  I have faith in you OP  You've got this    Feel free to PM me if you have any questions  People are different  if you can be content  it doesn't mean anybody can become content all of a sudden  Because then the party will be very tedious  At least that's how it would be for me   I attribute the amount of books to self publishing being easier than ever and people tapping into a new way for

depression anxiety caused much more of a loss of brain function  and that using medication  presently Wellbutrin  Lexapro  Ritalin  b vitamins  made my brain much faster  as i could "see through the fog" mich better  Also  depression made makes it harder to remember things  when i started medication it felt like i had access to memories again   The meds you take shouldn't be at a level to make everyrhing "perfect " that doesn't exist and is when you're losing your mind  i feel like   They let you function on a basic level much better  so you can do the work in your life to feel better long term  You sound smart  Id hangout with you   Studying formal grammar can help you learn the structure of language  and that can help anyone think more logically in general  I recommend starting with learning all the rules for punctuation  and then different sentence structure types  Sentence diagramming is great for this    Also  just be patient with yourself  and focus on getting your ideas out  not on the way you talk  Don't try to sound formal  and just be yourself  The listener can tell  and they appreciate you being genuine  I love my kid and my husband dearly but we certainly have a strong willed and stubborn child  It's been a struggle in itself just learning how to teach him that he won't get his way all the time  My husband has the patience of Job to be able to deal with my shortcomings and mental illness and a stubborn child  I admire him for that  Parenting is certainly one of the most difficult things we have been through as a couple and I can't imagine doing it with anyone else  I just hope I'm making the right move and that it will get easier from here  well he probably still is kissless he only ate her out lmao Idk man  My parents were pretty strict when I was growing up too  and I completely relied on them for everything  They are usually somewhat rational  so they would present their reasons  and I would let them know why their reasons weren't flawed  If that didn't do it  I would tell them that they are being emotional instead of logical  and I can't support their view  Then I would just do it  Realistically  they want me to be happy  They aren't going to do anything that descreases the quality of my life when I can't support their delusions  I would just go for it  What are they really going to do  You're a fucking adult  Unless you're a complete shithead  they should have nothing to worry about  Now we just laugh about the times I went to parties I wasn't supposed to go to  Go for it  I learned to read tabs there's a site that has all the cheat sheets on how to play songs  and just went from there and for piano I just synthenesia  My current boyfriend told me just before I left and we started dating  we didn't see each other for 2 months and I am so glad he did  almost 7 years later and we are together   With 5years long distance  You have nothing to lose  just win Or you get a boyfriend and you can move on You should do it before you go and in person    Yeah  he's looking for sex  I'm not nearly as old as he is and I've got literally nothing in common with an 18 year old   except we could have sex  Can you see yourself hooking up with an old guy like this  His body and mannerisms will be way different than guys your age or in their 20's  I'd burn the business card and avoid that store like the plague   Maybe  I mean its not like i do drugs but still my parents are probably not like yours though so rationality wont matter its just authority and power imo  They probably think "my house  my rules" regardless of logic  Try out certain nootropics to help improve your forgetfulness  slow it down    No mostly just no response  So sorry   Amazing how empty love gone makes one feel   Just experiencing that myself   Met a woman  online   Yet strongest connection I have ever felt   Though I expressed caring and affection in many ways  I never told her I loved her   Now I know that lack of expression of Love made her doubt me    and  on her own  reconsider our relationship   She has moved on    and I hope I have learned something valuable  as you have learned   Hoping this emptiness gets easier to live with    I know I won't find another love this strong   Here's hoping you will   Don't you stop hoping and looking   I'm not   But he doesn't want to leave the situation  either  He wants to stay in the apt and stay in the reationship with me  even though he knows I cheated on him and tried to leave him  he doesnt care I wouldn't say your point of view is weird  it's actually common because there is still such a stigma around seeking help for mental health problems   but it's frustrating for me as a therapist  I hope you do consider seeking help  you'd be a good candidate and you could start feeling better soon   Unless you plan on committing a bunch of murders  I don't see any reason why someone having your DNA would cause you any problems   Cats are dumb  This is actually really helpful for me  Thank you   Well my mom is crazy religious and has literally never partied in her life  I was suspended for selling weed right when I started high school  so obviously my parents were refusing me for good reasons  Ultimately  I did really well in school  so what are they going to do  They aren't going to pay for my school  Fine  if you want to fuck up my future to prove a point it's on you  It's not going to happen  Just go  Their worries are not justified  and maybe you need to show them that   As a momma to a 14 month old    your husband needs to chill  Taking care of yourself first IS taking care of your baby  That has to happen before anything else is possible   Also  if by some slim chance you're in the Detroit metro area  I'll sit for you so you can catch a break  Please help her  If someone's being hurt in a situation like this  you should never stay silent  She's scared and doesn't know how to get out of her abusive relationship  that's why she didn't want to get the police involved  I would call them and let them know everything that happened  plus you've got pictures to show the condition she was in  Please call for help  don't let her suffer in silence  She might be seriously injured or may die if she has no one to run to next time he gets violent  If you feel uncomfortable staying in their house then you should consider leaving  This   You can buy your own place wherever   You'll have an amazing resume that would be virtually second to none  virtually allowing you to get a job in management  but not a CEO position   So you'll be a leader  but feel far less overwhelmed   Clear your mind  1  Find a room where you won't be disturbed for at least 10 minutes   2  Sit down  close your eyes and stop thinking   If a thought enters your head phase it out   You should be focusing on your breathing and heart rate   Both should be steady and normal   When you can get your heart rate steady and normal  this is your "natural" state   3  Do this exercise for 10 minutes any chance you get   Have you ever noticed that when you are anxious your breathing and heart rate starts to speed up and become irregular   This is the state of anxiety   When you are confident and feel like you are at your best or you really don't care  your heart rate is relaxed and normal   Stop thinking so much   Focus on your heart rate and breathing   When you do feel your heart rate and breathing start to speed up  become aware of it and start to slow it down back to normal   A good way to do is to stop thinking and when you take action  Approach people because you want to see what happens  not necessarily to get them to like you   Sometimes you'll be shocked at how well people respond to you     Most people want to be with people who they can sit in the room  not say a word  and still enjoy each others company   Sounds weird  but if you notice  the friends you may have  you really don't need to entertain them so much   You don't need to impress them   Your presence is good enough  You may feel the same way about certain people   I hope this helped  They are Hispanic teenagers  Do you really think that they don't know  what "Build the Wall" means  Especially to them and potentially members of their family   Did you not read the OP's problem which is that  she has been asked to talk to them about specific bad behavior   That kind of means that it's not an accusation  but rather a fact that directly caused this particular issue to be brought up  How would you sugar coat this  pray tell  At least he  has  friends    Unless your ex was abusive  I don't see any reason why people you know should cut them out of their lives just because your relationship didn't work out   This has been the hardest thing I've ever decided to do  I really appreciate your support and your kindness  It means so much to hear this even from a stranger  Thank you  I'm glad  It may have been stated a little harshly  but combatting stigma against mental illness is something I'm very passionate about  No one should have to suffer because think they "should" be able to handle something   THIS IS MY BROTHER  NOT PEOPLE I KNOW   I think you'd do best to stick in there for the moment  as it very much sounds like it's something to do with his life that's making him uncomfortable  I don't think it would be you  as unless you've gone under a very drastic change in between about 2 years ago and a year and a half ago  it's probably something to do with his life  This does seem very typical of him being nervous of something  It's usually a bit more obvious when it's their SO   You should also consider the possibility you are exactly what's holding him together  That you're the strand that keeps him sane  Keeps him breathing  Helps him get up in the morning  My girlfriend has very low self esteem due to the fact that she has had more than 15 bad dating experiences  being a girl with a large cup size in a bad part of town  Which sadly  to scummy guys who'll drop you in a second  is the only pre requisite for a glorified one night stand  She thinks she's a burden to me because that's how her brain has trained her to think of herself  but really she's everything that's pure in my life  You could well be his angel  but he's having a lot of trouble expressing it properly to you  as I sometimes do  because of outside stress  During exam times or any big ol' stressful event like that  those are the time's I've come close to breaking up  despite her being my lifeline  Just don't give up on him  you might not know the whole story of why he's upset  From your previous post I'm going to assume you met him online and haven't met in person   so that's how I'm going to approach this   Use your head and ask yourself what do you really know about him   Until you actually meet  your only talking to a resume or a highlight of what he wants you to know   This guy doesn't love you   If he did he would be making a serious effort to physically spend time with you   A guy that loves you would work on helping you through your body issues  not asking about your weight  and demanding nudes     As far as the swinging  nothing is wrong with it provided your relationship is stable and healthy   However  anytime you bring others into a  relationship there are serious risks that have to be taken into account  Clear rules and boundaries need to be set up   Your boyfriend is  showing a clear lack of boundaries   Hold your ground and don't let him bully you into sending nudes   He's heavily into the swing scene   What's going to stop him from sharing what you send him   What's stopping him from finding a side girl to send his dick to   The fact that hes fantasizing heavily about swingers is disrespectful because hes telling you he wants to fuck another girl   Would he be cool if you said you had a neighbor that wanted to fuck you   I'm not gonna tell you to leave him or stay   That's your personal choice  but know that you deserve a healthy relationship with someone who's eyes are only upon you and will respect your personal boundaries     Don't we all I don't know  I just can't bring myself to do it over the phone  I feel like it's something we have to talk about in person  I don't even know why  and I know it's stupid   How does it affect you though  if your brother goes to the same party as your ex  Are you worried they are going to hook up   Yup  High school never ends  as they say  I can't do it before I go  I leave early tomorrow morning and have no way of seeing him today  And he's a really good friend  so I have that to lose if he says no   Have you seen him to confirm if he is sick or not  If he isn't  I would stick to telling her that  You never actually saw him smoking the joint so you can't prove it's his  Did whoever it was smoke it inside  Because damn near the whole house would reek of weed  Seems kind of stupid to me to smoke a joint in someone else's house  who I gather probably doesn't smoke weed and will definitely smell it  Therefore they will handle it and you wouldn't need to  I'm more afraid of talking to people than seeking help  so I will solve 2 problems at once  Thank you  I will find someone to help me  you've just got a point for making someone realise seeking help is inevitable and important  One way to deal with this problem is to avoid groups and just hang out one on one     By the way  part of the reason for this phenomenon is that a large percentage of people  starting from a young age  are completely obsessed with popularity and spend most of their waking hours trying to be popular     I myself find it hard to spend much time thinking over what clothes to wear and buy  which people I am better off being seen with  which people I should avoid  and so on   I tend to wear what's comfortable and spend time with people I like regardless of their social standing   I would guess a lot of the people here are like that which is part of the reason they are unpopular        Yes and no  While sexism is very much alive among Caucasian males  cultural norms are different between cultural groups  As a result  highlighting certain issues or concerns to play to those differences can make for more effective communication and better results   Your suggestion is little like saying  "When giving a talk to people from the middle east  be sure to give them a thumbs up to show things are good " Which is nice  until you realize that the thumbs up gesture is the same as flipping them off in many countries over there   yikes  I haven't seen him confirm he's sick he said he has nausea  I did confirm it was smoked because there is ash on the deck and no one smokes in my family  Congratulations and thank you for fighting yourself  This is a start  and it's not necessarily going to be an upward trend all the way  but remember that now you have the collective trust and empathy of many of us behind you as well  Leverage that energy  and use it to pull yourself up now and push yourself up later when your feet are on the ground but you want that boost of self love   Place your needs at the center of your universe while you push through this  You'll come to realize how important and valuable you are as you progress   Much love and solidarity  OP     Well  that's 3 more non bot matches than I've gotten in years  I agree that most of us here would give 100  in a relationship while  I can read tabs but I still can't play them because I don't have the skill do you see her at something in day to day life  Because if so  you should just not message her at all  If she wants to get back together she will come to you right  What's your point  I was a complete FA and a KHV until I did that    3 matches bro  Get a match a day like you're doing  and you'll find someone in 2017  Maybe  Could happen  Worth a shot  Maybe not  Where is he now  If you can  go find him and confront him about it  See if he looks high or smells like weed  If that's not possible or you don't want to confront him  tell your parents  That's really a rude thing to do to smoke in someone else's house who's letting you stay there  and just leave your mess everywhere   dont do it for the women  do it for yourself Not at all  My brother's GF and my ex are friends  I just hate that he would choose to go with them instead of coming to celebrate with his family  his blood  me  I introduced them all to each other  and hes hanging out with the new bf of my ex as well  doesn't that scream "traitor "  Almost every COD game has a nonexistent player base on PC  simply because most PC players don't like the games  Head on over to r pcmasterrace and ask around there for game recommendations  Steam still has the winter sale going on so you can still get some classic games for cheap  It's probably because you have no bigger goals in life  You're living the day to day and just floating through life with no direction  Maybe I'm wrong  but that's what I'm getting  Just do it so you don't end up second guessing yourself for the rest of your life  Don't play the "what if" game with yourself  it'll drive you crazy  Even if you get rejected  at least you'll know where you stand  and there should be no regrets  because you gave it a shot  You win NYE I hate that shit so much  How is ignoring someone a good solution for anything  Fuck her   1  Change how the board meetings are held or where they're held  be creative  you're 20 and have a very profitable business  figure it out    2  Take someone with you  Or research where you are going and find something unique that area has to offer  plan accordingly    3  Want to take longer holidays  Find someone whom you trust  whom is qualified to step in as you  not a yes man  Pay them well treat them with respect     4  Human resources department    5    6  See  4    7  Invest in people  Pay them well make it clear on expectations  don't hover over them but don't be a ghost either  keep tabs and if you see something you don't like  say something and show them how you would like it done   8  You're the man at the top act that way  it seems to me you try and do everything yourself  Having it done your way is very different from just doing it yourself  You got to where you are by being creative and getting what you want by working your ass off  you need to continue doing this if you want to grow    The worst thing you can do is nothing  go get it   Best of luck      Do you know what makes successful people successful  No  it's not money or influence  What makes them successful is the fact that they can fall flat on their face  break every facial bone possible  get back up and ram whatever it is again face first  Also  you didn't fail  you just didn't succeed  Failure is when you don't try   you tried  Pick yourself up  brush yourself off  learn from your mistakes and prepare yourself for the next face bash     When are most people returning to work after the holidays   I was never a party guy or club guy  I've been to them usually dragged by my best friend but I always felt out of place  It also didn't help that he was getting literally groped by women and Im basically ignored  This is fuckin brutal and fucked up  But i still gotta ask  are you fat  Or why are so repulsive  Yeah that's very true and a very good outlook on life  And by no means am I upset with my situation i n life in general  I'm actually pretty happy  I just wish I wasn't so bad with dealing with people haha    People are all around you    use them as practice   When you go into a store  and you see a cute cashier  flirt with her   Not because you want to get her  but because you want to practice your confidence with meeting new people   It's gonna be weird at first but if you do it enough times  you'll get use to it   If you do this to  let's say  100 people a month  that's only about a little over 3 people a day   you may bump into one of them outside their job or wherever you flirted with them   If she recognizes you  she may walk up to you and talk to you   Remember that these people are not in a vacuum    they do have a life outside that specific place you've seen them   Imagine if out of those 100 people you flirted with  7 of them gave you their number another day   You hung out with 7  of  them   It's only 7  success but people usually can only give their attention to a handful of people at a time   If you're allowed to date  you have 7 potential dates   You mentioned that you are learning about Entrepreneurship   A book I highly recommend is Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki   Don't borrow that book    buy it   If you lose it or lend it to someone  buy yourself another copy   That book is a life changer   You will get a good solid foundation of how money and business works   I hope this helped  Read up on ADD or ADHD  sounds familiar I completely disagree  If he's only into minors  that's not something that you should accept or do things that will amplify it  like going with him to your brother's games    If he's befriending these young guys and then they're becoming uncomfortable and trying to leave him  that seems to me he's trying to use friendship as a way to coax them into something they're uncomfortable with   This is a tough situation  and I honestly don't know what I would do in this case  If he dated someone who was 17  I would probably let that slide  but when he is into people as young as 15 and as young as your brother  that's not good  It's illegal  they are not old enough to consent  and it could lead to a manipulative relationship   It's definitely easier said than done  but I think you should ask him about it and whether or not he's into younger guys  He probably can't help who he's into  but that doesn't make it right  If you feel comfortable doing it  try to be there to support him with fighting those urges   Best of luck to you  Why don't you find a successor  Somebody you know very well and someone you can trust and leave the business to him  Or the other choice is like the previous comments cash your chips and go home  But what do i know i'm just an 18 year old    Thanks  That sounds amazing  I think I am 22 and currently around 65 kg  I will definitely follow your advice  But I still don't understand the point of going gym  I have already heard that skinny people should also go to gym before you will suggest that     But I don't want to gain muscles  it's not a crime if you don't want to be muscular   I am also not fat at all anywhere  Also if I am correct  you lose lot of calories and burn fat by going gym  Doesn't I want more fat in my body  Am I missing anything  You friends probably did care about you  but they were unsure of what to do  They may have thought you wanted space since they probably noticed you actively trying to avoid them  You can still have a fresh start too  24 is not that old  I'm sorry you had to go through that  but you can become a stronger person from it  Also  some of those happy couples probably were not even happy  My one friend spent New Year's Eve with a guy she met on Tinder just so she could post a photo on Instagram of her kissing someone at midnight  She will probably never see this guy again  I know it's hard  but you just have to keep trying if you want a partner  If not  it can get better the older you get  I made peace with being forever alone relationship wise  I have good friends so I hang with them when I get lonely   I just want to share with you  I did a master's degree in biology and never landed a job in my field  however  things I learned while doing "intellectual bulimia" as you put it  did serve me well later on in life  be it only when I changed domain for a trade job  that pays well    when the kids I was studying with would give me enormous praise for my math and language skills  and my general culture so to speak  Well  at one point  their attitude towards me ended up making me feel uncomfortable of course  and through such situations  they unexpectedly taught me something that my long years of university never brought me even close to learning   humility  My point being that you probably don't need to come across as intelligent if you are and you know it yourself   unless it is absolutely necessary for you to polish your soft skills in order to land a position belong to a particular group   in which case you simply need practice  and some form of mentorship  find brilliant speakers on youtube and emulate them   Np  Moderators are just people who started the subreddit  A mod can make others mods if they choose   Mods administrate the subreddit   Fuck  this puts a lot of the things I see on this sub into perspective    Happy new year  buddy   Everyone has something that they're interested in  you just haven't found it yet and that's fine  When I was 21  I was working as a janitor and had absolutely no direction whatsoever  I had no idea what I was going to do with my life  nothing interested me  I worked a job that I hated because it paid well but I was still miserable  I didn't find what I wanted to do until early in 2016  Patience my friend  I don't mean patience as in be lazy  I mean  sometimes you have to do what you can and let the universe do the rest  Explore  get out and try new things  meet new people  Dive into a subject that you never considered before  There's so much out there in the world to find    Also  I'll throw this out there just in case it ends up being helpful or interesting  I am a life coach and have helped people who lack direction and clarity  I'd be more than happy and willing to talk to you and help you with this if it's something you'd be interested in and willing to try  Don't hesitate to reach out if you want to talk   Aw  that's sad   You should try and get out more   You deserve to exist too   You are welcome in public   Happy New Year  That was cool of your professor   Sometimes   people see the true potential in others and understand that life happens and give a break where it's needed   Well  I run a practice where people pay  50 for a 10 15 minute consultation where I offer tough love  They must really  really value it  Not sure it's wise to assume everyone feels like you on this topic  You need to relax  My husband hasn't done anything to warrant a "chill"  He works in the hospital and knows first hand what happens when someone commits themselves for suicide watch  He has been very supportive and if I still feel I need to go in he agrees that I should go and get better  He just wants me to know exactly what to expect from that decision should it have been the route I chose to take  He has never told me or given me any reason to think he finds me selfish or inadequate of caring for our child  He understands my illness is debilitating at times and that sometimes I need more help than others and gives me all the love and care I could ask for  He wants me to get help and together we agree that giving myself some time to recuperate and think about what exactly I need for myself and what I really want is the best choice  This is my decision alone  he is merely there to give me insight and support   I appreciate your support and offer but i do not feel my husband is in any way in the wrong   Consider a greyhound  They are actually couch potatoes    I wouldn't recommend a small terrier breed of dog as they are bred to be high energy and can be very stubborn  Working dogs such as border collies are also a poor choice for apartments   Op taught me that "wang" can be used as a verb  or was it an adjective   Anyway  I am so totally going to start using this word   Br  Are you dealing with depression   You don't have to answer if that's too personal  Wow  you sound really good  I can see what you mean by projecting  If my mom doesn't want divorce  I wouldn't want to upset her  Thanks for the advice  Thank you for your kind words of encouragement and support   You experienced an abusive relationship for some time  Be patient with yourself  Do things you were scared to do   continue to get rid of her things  Take back the music you liked that you associate with her   take back anything that you want to be a part of yourself and make it yours  Try to meet people who care about you   real friends    Ultimately realize that what you experienced was someone hurting you for years   if someone had been beating you every day for years then you'd have some bruises and injuries that would need to physically heal  Let yourself emotionally heal and realize it will take time  Don't lay on additional stress by feel bad for being stressed    Stay strong  You got this person out of your life and you will only be stronger because of that  You're the captain of your ship again   If I understand your post correctly  you are not happy with your bf's lack of motivation and the fact that he smokes pot  He apparently doesn't care that this upsets you or you have not told him  Either way  you are both unhappy  You already cheated on him and would have left him if the other guy hadn't broken things off  If your bf really doesn't care that this happened  then he has some serious self esteem issues that need to be worked out  I don't see this ending well  Nowhere in your posts did you say you were staying with him out of love  Mostly pity and financial security  it seems like  If the two of you are fine with settling for each other and not being happy  then more power to you  It just doesn't sound like an ideal situation to me   In the chance you're not trolling  here's some advice   If you do not love Phil  end your relationship with Phil  Phil should be with someone who agrees with his lifestyle choices  You can't come in here  expect him to pay for the shit you want while at the same time telling him how to live his life   A healthy partnership is between two people who agree to terms that are mutually beneficial  If the guy wants to be high and play video games all day while still paying his portion of rent  and that doesn't work for you  then this is not a healthy partnership   1  If you're only keeping him around for his additional income  you are a bad person  2  You must learn to live within your means  If you cannot afford it  you cannot have it  3  If you want more in life  get the fuck up off your ass and go fucking earn it  tbh its all because of my acne scars  Ever since I developed acne scarring I have been universally discriminated against and denied any fairness  I fucking hate everybody so much  I just went for a drive around town so I could flip off every person I saw   I have a pretty bad memory  probably not as bad as yours admittedly   but I realized not that long ago that sometimes there are some things you can't change and you'll have to work harder and create systems of organization and routines in order to function at the average level that most people are at  It sucks to have to work harder to do something that seems like everybody does easily  but you work with what you have  not with what you wish  Look into reminder apps for your phone  I set reminders for almost everything using Due on iOS   I have a white board right by my front door where I can leave notes to remind me of things before I leave my apartment  I take pictures of parking spaces so I don't forget where my car is  If you can't store your memory in your mind then you can work on finding ways to store it somewhere else   Wat  My therapist has taught me so much over the past two years  but the most important thing she taught me was to be kind to myself  since I'm so much harder on myself than I would be to someone else in my situation  She taught me to acknowledge that I have some serious issues and that I fight those issues every day instead of giving up  To give myself the credit I deserve for attempting  even if I sometimes fail  To recognize that seeking help when I need it shows courage and resourcefulness  not weakness    Never think that you failed because you couldn't handle your BPD on your own  You  are  handling it on your own  You decided on your own that you need help  and you are taking the steps to get that help  You aren't a mental health professional  and you  can't  do it on your own without seeking assistance from one    Would you consider an accomplished athlete to be a failure because they used a personal trainer to coach them  and went to a nutritionist to find out what their body needed to perform at its best  If they get injured  would you expect them to forego physical therapy and pain medication  Would it make their successes any less "theirs" to rely on those with more knowledge to guide them      Your brain is just another body part that needs training and occasionally suffers injuries  There is no shame in seeking treatment   it shows that you're taking responsibility for your health  Do this for yourself  you need to stick around for your son and your husband  but you also need to stick around for YOU  You deserve the chance to watch your son grow up and to grow old together with your husband  and you deserve to be happy and healthy while you do it    Congratulations on your first step toward that future  Be kind and congratulate yourself as well  on this step and every step you take  Be compassionate with yourself when you falter  and give yourself credit for having the guts to keep going  Finally  remember that others like myself think you're brave and strong for fighting  even if you don't always see it that way   Aw  You're the best  I saved a pigeon from the mall  I bought one of those plastic fabric bags from marshalls and put him in there for the bus ride home  I thought it was a baby and couldn't fly yet  I put him in my bathroom for a few days  He pooped everywhere   I ended up taking him back to the mall and he flew back up to the ledge where I'm assuming he fell out of  Some of the other pigeons were kinda mean to him so I threw pennies at them until they left him alone  I watched for at least 2 hours  When I thought he would be ok  I left    I realized he probably would've been ok if I had just left him alone in the 1st place   My suggestion   take him back to where you found him or take him to an animal shelter   Good luck    You're awesome  Stop Dude trust me it's all about how your present yourself Don't have low self esteem Have confidence in yourself When you wake up in the morning look at yourself in the mirror and be like " I am the baddest bitch there is"  Maybe High school girls are judgmental and date based on looks but trust me girls who goes to university don't rely on look  It's all about your personality confidence and how you present your self in general   He doesn't want to leave  he wants to stay in the apt with me and stay with me in a relationship  He doesnt have many friends  is high most of the time and has never really had a gf   Oh  your user made me think you were brazilian  Sry    Oh  you are so sweet  but my cousin shared his account with me already  And sharing your account is not so great for you  you need to change it from primary to sub  which means you can only access your own games when you are connected to PSN      You don't really have to play the previous Witcher games  90  of the characters are new  and the story is not too complicated  basically you are a monster hunter  for example  you speak with farmers  they tell you that a griffin killed their horses  you locate the griffin  fuck it up  then cut it's head off and show it to the farmers  and they give you wheat or some shit for reward  I think it's one of the best games currently on the PS4   Yeah I've been invited but have no one to go with i

2017  It's in your hands to make it a great one  Be kind to yourself and the people around you  What are your goals and dreams in life  Since you mention your parents I guess they are important to you and you want to make them proud again  Surprise them this year  Do things people do not expect from you  Use that money you used for weed to help people or travel  Always remember if you do not start now    you never will  If the life you have right now is not going the way you like it  Change it   Thank you so much  It's so hard to remember that self care doesn't always mean selfishness and that I need to mean something to myself as well as to those around me  this is one of those times where I need to be reminded the most   You are the issue but it's an easy fix   You have what I call automatic rejection syndrome   You think people are going to automatically reject you   If you dress different and you like the way you dress  fuck it    that's what you like   If you own it  people will have to accept the fact that that's what you like if they're going to be with you   People love music   If you are a musician  that may mean you think different to them too   Look at the millions of people who faint over musicians   Not saying that people will faint over you  but you may win them over because you have a skill that a lot of people don't have   If you're good  that may get females checking you out   You don't really need similar interest to people  but you need to find similarities that you can connect with with certain people   You don't need to find people who dress like you or play music like you  but you can make friend with people because the both of you may learn something from one another   One person may know how to draw or write short stories   Another person may fix cars   Another person may know how to sculpt   The four of you may become friends because one fixed your car at a good price   The other became your friend because they draw a comic strip that you like in the school paper   Another one may have did a sculpture of Captain America   You may have similarities that each one of you want to meet new friends and this is what bought you together   You gotta be okay with yourself before you can get others to accept you   It sounds like a cliche  but it's true   You can find like minded people in forums or other subreddits   If you're into entrepreneurship  you may want to join a forum or a subreddit with people with similar interest   You may not meet them in person but at least you can communicate with people who think like you   A book I highly recommend for entrepreneurship is Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki   It changed my life in a big way   I hope this helped  Your first mistake is having T Mobile If you're wanting to get into web design  you're going to have to buy a PC regardless  The great thing about PC gaming is that you can always upgrade components as money comes along where as with console gaming if you want something better  you have to buy a new console outright  Check out  r buildapc if you want some information on PC building  Just my two cents  Probably better not to use that condom in your wallet  The one you put there just in case when you were fifteen  Holy Fuck at least let him enjoy his first day as a non virgin  Hey thanks man  that's the major thing I'm trying to weigh out  But like I said thanks for your time and advice  I really appreciate it     Yes and no  You have a lot more freedom after high school  but you also have more responsibility  People remain about the same  but you have the ability to pick where you want to be more effectively   You aren't forced to go to one school and spend time with those limited people  Instead  you have to decide what scene you want to be in and see who is there  If you don't like the scene  change it    College is also nothing like high school  Everyone self selects into the classes  which means generally you get people with fairly compatible motivations for being there  A class full of history students  are all paying to sit in that seat  by choice   So  if you like history  them being there in that seat is a good sign you have something in common  Also  campus is larger so it isn't like you run into the same clump of people everywhere   Haha  I can understand your hostility  Not sure this is the best way to relieve it though   I would suggest a smallish dog  Not a terrier but like a pug mix or a chihchi mix  I would even suggest a senior dog that doesn't have issues walking  I have no idea if you live in a space with tons of stairs   Set aside a time to cry and let it all out   I do this when I absolutely have to be productive in the moment   For example  I tell myself  "I don't have time for emotions until  insert time " and I make sure I follow through with it   I wouldn't advise doing this frequently  however It has helped me get through some days  I think he meant  she was way more beautiful and elegant than Op could realistically expect in this life  Hostile  No  not at all  So what is your field in  I get this  It's one of the most annoying and conflicting things I've ever felt   I've also felt the opposite   this guy was everything I thought I was into  But I couldn't get feelings for him  This post has been marked as  No Advice Wanted  NAW   https   redd it 21w712    Advice is subject

get ignored all the time  The worst was when   I'd wish someone a happy birthday on facebook and they wouldn't rerspond to me and actually respond to everyone else     But yeah you don't need that in your life  i'm not going to tell you that you're better alone but it's better than thinking that you actually have friends    Do not give suicide suggestions to people here  Thanks     Good for you  I'm confident that you will benefit from talking it over with a trained professional  Please let me know if I can be of further assistance   You developed lung cancer at 25 years from smoking  Yeah def sounds shady  I've seen one case of someone less than 30 getting lung cancer with smoking but it was secondary to abestosis with mesothelioloma but that was a 3rd word country and the dude was sleeping on it  I find this hard to believe  I can understand how that could be super frustrating and irritating  Your issue is somewhat unique in that this is a rational response to an actual problem  Talking about this with someone with whom you have a good therapeutic rapport can help you develop healthier or more effective coping skills     You may also explore the possibility of a referral to a dermatologist or other specialist to see if there re any cosmetic options for you to help remedy the problem     The sidebar has a link to the international and national suicide hotline numbers  What do you think  I guess you saying that he looked at you "coolly" and said you need to know what you're getting into did not make him sound supportive  Especially since you basically had to breakdown and confess this to him  Idk  But I am glad he's supportive and wish you all the best   hope that you have a wonderful recovery  Couldn't of said it any better  We've been trying our best to get him somewhere to live  He has another week to find a place or somewhere to go or we have to let him go as we've tried our best with him  He's rang up many places but no luck yet  We have also asked many friends to keep a look out too  He's only 18  Thanks for your input   Wat   I don't speak Portuguese   Do you know anyone that has gone to rebab   What makes you think they work   They don't   I'm afraid you have selected the most expensive and least effective method   Simply white knuckling it works just as well    I really  really want to see people getting the help they need  so strongly recommend listening to the others here   And don't take my word for it  please research and Google rehab success rates    as published by anyone other than a rehab   Its not stupid  Please stop beating yourself up over this  You really should be more positive and confident in your relationship with him  The last thing you want to do is create a self fulfilling prophecy  Its like when you dont want a certain thing to happen  but your actions inevitably end up creating the exact thing you didnt want    Take a deep breath  realize that what you feel is amazing  someone makes you feel like walking on air  Even if he doesnt reciprocate its still amazing that youre capable of such emotion  And realistically if it doesnt work out  your friendship SHOULD survive unless hes immature  If it doesnt go the way you want it to  dont despair  its gonna suck for a little bit but now you know that feeling is possible  someone else will come by and make you feel that again if thats whats meant to be   As long as you follow some basic health hygiene you'll be fine   Try corn as a food or bird seed  FYI town pigeons will eat human vomit  eeew I know and not suggesting you puke up for it but they will eat shit thats why they're such good breeders   same People grow apart  it's normal and natural  I have had loads of friends sort of "float" away  and I've drifted away from other friends  too  That's life  Clinging to friendships that are past their expiration date can often do more damage than good  Ask friends for a recommendation on dentists   They will lead you to a good one    The cleaning is a hassle but better than the alternative of unbelievable pain from rotting teeth   Good job on flossing and brushing regularly   Unless you constantly eat sweets and drink  soda it probably won't be that bad  This sub has people that have never been in a relationship or don't have friends or both   Every once in a while we get a "I wanna die" thread   I guess you get the impression that forveralone comes from rage comic but no it's not a joke  How old are you   Won't be awkward for long  just see them as another person  they grounded you because they want you to learn your lesson  but mostly because they love you  They are your parents and not some police officers   Maybe your dad is making the jokes to lighten the tension  just act normal and have a laugh with him  Talking just doesn't fix the issue  If I am still being discriminated against I am going to get upset about it   Acne scars are permanent  I have already spent thousands of dollars and years trying to treat them  I feel society has offered me the option to clean other peoples shit from a toilet bowl or starve to death  No matter what I say  how hard I work  or what I do that will never change  There is no incentive for me to work hard or cooperate with anyone because I will be relegated to the bottom for something I have no control over   I am so sorry   so sorry   Hugs to you    If I was you I'd just do the subject again next year if I failed  basically you'll have twice as much time to learn the content and hopefully get a great grade the next time you do it   I've been to uni for a lot of years now and the biggest thing I found out is the people who do the best  are the hard workers  I've met a lot of smart people in my time studying  and a lot of them bail out  a lot stay also  but the ones who really understand the topic  who really do well  are the people who wasn't specifically smart  but who put the effort in   I believe you should stop feeling like an idiot  as you've done great getting this far  it sounds you may be slower in the uptake  but to be great at any subject it's that hard work that you've been doing to get there   I don't think you should sell yourself short here  almost everyone I know of has failed at least 1 to 2 subjects at uni  myself included   Unless you start feeling the whole degree to be too overbearing  I'd say you're probably just in one of those difficult subjects due to this   Even the very good students are struggling and complaining about lack of time and might just need a bit more time on it    If possible it might be worth talking to the topic coordinator and seeing if theres any help or ideas they can give you in the course   I wish you luck on your future mate  Wait  What's wrong  Your brother gotta cater to his gf and his gf want to go to the party   Seems like you just not over the break up  Tomorrow or today  Every time I have been out in public I have felt less than welcome  I will try to get out more though  Thank you for the kind words  Hit up  r dogs and  r dogtraining   Pick a breed or mix with an energy level you are enthusiastic about dealing with  A border collie needs hours to run daily  for example  Which is why so many become destructive  their families are not able or willing to exercise them enough    Lots of "older puppies"   dogs 6 months to 2 years old end up in shelters  They get big and their people haven't put the training in  So then you have a problem with barking  or jumping  up or chewing   These can be great dogs  But the training takes time  And you may need to untrain bad habits from former owners   Don't rush  Get a sense what you like  And what you can handle  Go look at lots of dogs  Talk to people  You never know who is fostering a nice dog in need of a home  Someone texted you instead of sending a wedding invitation  Was it an incredibly low key event  Because that just seems odd   Ooooh don't worry  girls are not stupid  if you don't deserve her  she knows it already   Looks like someone is trolling the meme   The bird is smiling in the first photo  Take a keeper Lonely guy here who has nothing to live for  not even friends and I can say is that the loneliness eventually catches you  I wish I had an IRL friend      We know because we do not lack self awareness   A lot of normies do lack self awareness and they assume if you're FA you must be worse than them  You're right  talking in and of itself will not fix the issue  You can't change the situation so you need to change your perspective and your behavior in order to have less maladaptive feelings toward it  That's where the talking with someone with whom you have good therapeutic rapport comes in   I'm very glad you are getting help  it sounds like you have made the right choice for yourself and often that is half the battle  Maybe more    I wanted you to know that it's perfectly normal to be overwhelmed to the point of breaking by children  When my twins were born my father looked me in the eye and said "Remember  No one ever fell off the floor  No one ever died from crying  At some point  probably at 2am  you are going to be so angry with your child  Put them on the floor  go into another room and watch a tv show "  A dirty secret of parenting an infant is how close we all come to losing it  Every parent I know will admit to this    The good news is it's going to be better very soon  Difficult babies almost always become much more comfortable between 12   18 months as their digestive systems finally mature and they suffer from far less bloating and GI pain    Anyway  enough rambling  You sound like a great mom  not a bad one  Please know that  And hang in there    it gets better  So much better and easier so fast   This  it's never so much wanting to kill oneself as much as it is just hoping for death  You basically hit the lottery  cash out and disappear  I am most definitely over the break up actually  I even have a new woman I just wanted to hang out with my brother for New Years my reddit friends  My ex is just kind of spiteful and sneaky and very manipulative   Who  Was told in 8th grade "you're not the kind of guy girls want to date "  I've heard this before  It's a complicated number of things but basically anxiety impairs cognition which itself creates more anxiety  It's the reason your mind seems to go blank during those situations   I had the same thing happen to me  Found my boyfriend dead one morning on my bathroom floor  heroin OD  I didn't even know he used   It's a shock  You'll be in a state of shock for a while  there's no way avoiding it  Please take care of yourself  and allow others to take care of you  during this difficult time  You have my deepest sympathy  Feel free to message me anytime if you'd like to talk  There's an extra problem to the "great personality" thing I didn't think of last night   For a lot of women  when they meet a guy  put him in the category of "date" or "not date"   If you're in that second category they'll still think of you that way even when they see your "great personality"   Getting out of that second one is difficult at best    Wat  Hey man if you're socially active then it'll probably happen  LIVE  Yup  That is the best way  Meeting someone through a mutual friend has always been the way I've done things  Although I met a girl at a bar and ended up becoming friends and then sleeping with her lmao   We have always been open with each other about how my illness affects us in our marriage  he has been extremely understanding  relaxing and calm about it  He knows that him reacting strongly to me when I come to him only exasperates my erratic emotions and that I need him to be the level headed one when I cannot be  even when I try  I would much rather him to be relaxed than panicked and upset  I told him years ago that if I ever come to him saying I can't do it anymore that I just want him to hear me  support me and let me know what to expect  To be cool  calm and collected because I may not be able to do so myself  I guess I'm just not so great at letting that be known  Everything you've build together  everything you've both worked to become  all of the dreams you've had together  all of the desires you pursued  all that you are  and all the good you've become  everything you like about yourself because of him  and any dreams he may have given you  hold on to it all twice as hard now   I cannot relate to the intensity of your pain  but I can try to ease it by making you remember the good in your life    Remember him and all the good things you've both had together  Remember the type of persons you each became in each others company  Now  know that it's still possible to have those good times  Life isn't fair  and your going to be angry  distraught  and you may feel you'd want to collapse  But he wouldn't want that for you  You may not be able to bring him back  but know that he would want you to use your two hands and build yourself a harness to pull yourself back up  He would want you to use your two hands and build a new pillar to support you  Those five fingered grips can raise you back up slowly but surely  Use them to build a memorial to bring you solace    One tiny thing you could do would be to grab a piece of paper and something to write with  Jot down all of your feelings  emotions  and thoughts  Do this at least once a day  Find comfort in remembering those words he said to you  And heed that advice  Do it for him  and do it for yourself  like he would want you to   The pain won't go away for a long while  So right now  cry out all the tears you need to  Eat all the food you can  drink water  and take care of yourself  Eventually that pain will lessen  And you can find happiness again   If you need someone to talk to  or to hang out with online  I give you the option to pm me    Otherwise  find strength in his memory  and use it to make things better  Yes  we really are that sad  We probably do need help  but there is a limit to how helpful that help can actually be  Bro this is unnecessary  Don't be that dude because you'll end up being that dude for the rest of your life   Maturity will always clear your name  She just said she doesn't want to go ice skating anymore and said that maybe we should go to a movie  theatre or somehwere else  What are some otehr good options   D  Good one Lucky you  Both my parents passed away  The problem could be your brain is thinking beyond its ability  This can cause a mild headache but not super severe  Your brain might need a break  But not to long  Your meditation could have become a "drug"  This is completely normal like those who have to exercise to clear there head  This could be the same way for you but meditation  Who is this person and why are you telling them that you have no friends    After being the awkward eager kid for much of high school  I learned a valuable lesson  people want to be around winners  Or at least  those they perceive to be winners  They want to be around people who are fun  happy  entertaining    talking about how lonely you are sends the opposite message    Even if you  are  going to sit alone in a room crying on NYE  that should never be the message you're sending out to other people  because it will literally have them running in the opposite direction from you  Just my two cents as a someone who is fairly social  So what do you suggest  Should I not reply her    I was just offering playshare we just have to be in a party chat for that  P   I'll probably get it now  too many people keep saying to get it  There is no reason to feel awkward  It's good that you realize that you fucked up  Also remember that they were young once too  and they fucked up just like you did  That's why your dad is making jokes  He gets it  Kids screw up  As for the boredom  why not take up a musical instrument or some kind of art  Think of this as a period to work on your discipline and passion  It might be the best thing that ever happened to you  For right now  get some Gatorade  Wat  Did she express interest in it when you asked  I never went ice skating  I didn't want to go ice skating  I was invited and felt pressure to go ice skating  I ended up in a full leg cast for a year   Ask her if it would be something she would be interested in  and I'd say have a backup suggestion  It sounds fun and romantic  but some people will say "Sounds like I'm going to make a fool out of myself and or injure myself and that's no fun on a date " If she suggested a movie  what's wrong with that  I will say what I always have said  He is a twatwaffle   Oh gosh  Well maybe we should just go somewhere closer lol   I'm trying to make it under  1000 for each of us   Why isn't the drive from SF to SEA that's great  I would think it would be pretty along the coast Cash out  This is a job that runs down 50 year old  experienced business men to the point where they give up a lot  You're young  you don't need that stress  Sell the company and work as a consultant for awhile  maybe even for that business  You should aim for freedom at 20  Hell  you could probably even continue to work for that company and help grow it  but don't take on that much responsibility   I get what you're saying  I try to maintain a perspective that fits my situation and I am able to build things in my life  but that always leads me to feeling like I have built a glass house  Eventually that perspective slips  I get angry  and bad things happen    Thank you for your responses  I just reply with  "My face" Jim beam and Netflix Agreeing with  u HonestlyKidding  The movie is best  Ask to take her to dinner beforehand  Nothing fancy  but definitely not fast food  Texas Roadhouse  or Logan's Roadhouse  would be perfect   I feel the same damn way  I always make the wrong choice    That's cool   How'd you meet people   I haven't been out by myself in a while  but at times when I had  I never met anyone    i made an experiment  i sent a text message to those people on Christmas   I sent nothing on nye  This way I clearly signaled that I cared about them on Christmas  so they would be able to know I care about them so they would be able to send me a text message on nye without thinking "i'll let him send me a text message so that I know if he cares about me"   I got nothing on nye    I don't matter to them  end of story   It's really hard to consciously let go of those "friends"  I can put the " now  with whom I shared most of my  social  life with    I'm scared  Yep   That's true    The friendzone  One never escape it  Now let's say you and I go toe to toe in bird law and see who comes out the victor  I'm european  I've no idea what those things are   D  Thank you  it's nice to know it's normal to get angry with a baby  Not that I like it  or want it to happen but that when it does happen I'm not alone in it  I'm trying my hardest to be a good mom and often it feels like an uphill climb during an avalanche  I don't know if anything I do is going to actually benefit him but I'd like him to know that I'm trying   In plenty of ways  I can relate to you as well  There are moments where I try to rationalize my loneliness  but in reality   I know I need to do more with my life   I hate it when girls have huge metal penises and don't use lube  You was stoopids got drunk more importantly you're alive I assume thats all your parents give a  fuck about really   Have you ever walked over an unconscious homeless person and not phoned the EMT's  there are people who will do that 'not my problem' I've phoned the ambulance for a homeless person lying outside the shops and not one fucker thought to put thier coat on him   You could have passed out smacked your head of the pavement pissed yourself and not one fucker would have stopped to make sure you were okay  thats how you make things good by being a decent human    I don't have any advice for you  because you already know what to do  I just want to offer you a big virtual hug and let you know you are a good mother   Hopefully you told them to fuck off  moose blood   They have pretty good service for half the price Never had friends to exclude me  Win win  Nobody excludes me and I annoy no one  that's not an sjw  that's a numbnuts  Just stopped replying  Not worth letting them play the victim card with my name on the screenshots   Edit  I've had a couple girls do this before in HS  Don't give them what they want and they start rumors  Don't feed their flames   Thanks for the support  I'll let you know if I do  Well if you are capable of being social and are confident in general but spend most time alone then you are just an introvert  Some of us  can't  get any friends gf and have never had them  Also personally I'm pretty shit at other aspects of life too  You're a good man   If his wings are strong and he can fly  he will likely be okay   Google bird and wildlife rehabilitators and find one who will chat with you on what your best next step will be    Thank you so much for the virtual hug and encouragement  Sometimes it is better than advice to just to know someone cares  Thank you   Why don't you want to get better   In high school I mightve been dumb enough  Since then  no   nope This right here  Driving with overbearing parents just adds to the

and destruction  and when it does I'm going to love all these god damn worthless optimists eating their words  Unfortunately  it will be the poor nations that suffer first  as always  You can actually already see it happening  in Syria  the war was exacerbated by a poor crop yield  and there is a famine warning in West Africa  But eventually it'll trickle down to the US and I'll delight in the destruction of a society which was never worth a god damned dog shit to me  Robbin D  Hood  If you can stand suspicious looks from your neighbours You are incredibly brave  and a loving wife and mother  If that were not so  you wouldn't be willing to get help  I admire you more than you can ever know  and I'll keep you in my prayers  xoxo My main problem with getting off social media atm is that my phone is notorious for "losing" text messages  as well as calls  Facebook is the only way for people to be SURE they get a message to me  On top of that  family members are always posting newly scanned photos of family from LONG ago that no one else has  A cousin posted an album of 154 pictures  and only 5 of them were in our collection  When i finally get the money saved up i'll replace the phone  and likely get off it though  But right now im paying off a car  so the money to buy a phone isn't there  No don't do that  All you gotta say is something along the lines of  "sorry but no thank you  I am happy where I am right now"  The less you say the better   The sooner you get in the habit of being really mature about things  the sooner people will respect you  But gf's will AKWAYS tell their gfs if a dude is being immature  Likewise for men  You never want to give women an opportunity to throw the word "immature" in with your name   I'm so sorry for your loss and the trauma you've just endured  I hope you have someone to keep you company  and that you're not alone  Sending you a big hug    Your advice helped a lot  The initial panic and sadness as worn off  I've been covering it and only looking at it to wash or lotion it  I've been imagining that it's on someone else's body whenever I see it  and it's really not an awful tattoo  But I still hate it  I've decided laser treatment would make me the happiest  so I'm gonna let this bad boy heal up and then get it zapped as soon as I can  Hopefully it'll be gone by next year  No sweat  just a mistake that can be fixed  Maybe I'll get lucky this year      who am I kidding There's no easy way to tell him you just have to be upfront and quick about it  If you just tell him you see him as a friend he'll most likely be fine with it and if he isn't then you weren't meant to be friends with each other    The longer you wait to tell him that you only want to hangout as friends the more he'll resent you for leading him on regardless of if you actually are   Thank you so much for your support and encouragement  I wish you all the best for this year and every one after   Live a decade without ever hearing "I love you" or any other act of affection and see how you fucking feel  No  that isn't hyperbole  Of course it's not a fucking joke  Jesus fucking Christ  use your god damn head    I saw your pic in  r veganfitness  and I think you look great  Hopefully things will work out for you in 2017  Yeah I thought the same about 2016  But then it turned out to be pretty meh  Thanks  man  It's nice to know that y'all are so supportive  Got it totally    Many Thanks   Gonna do it that way   Oh boy  what a way to start off 2017  I agree  sell and become a weed farmer or something  Tried "help"  It didn't help  Birds often steal and eat the eggs of other birds  so it's not unheard of     If Im correct  1  100 words is around 2 3 pages   Yeah so this was something I submitted to a magazine that specializes in "flash fiction"  sub 2k words       Maybe you can just write as a hobby   For sure  I will continue to write no matter what kinds of reviews I get  It's just   since I have so little real communication in my life  I look at writing as a way to make other people think and feel things  That's all I really want to do  To reach the heart of a reader   Hey  thanks for reading and have a great new year  Good on your dad  That's awful of your mum to say  honestly  You should maybe be like "so do you want me to hide the rest of myself from you too  You signed up to have a kid  you signed up for whatever it was gonna turn out to be  Either you have all of me  or you don't have me " Or something  I know that won't fix it  but from experience I can say sometimes it feels worse not to say anything even if saying something won't fix it  The worst part of a hangover for me is the anxiety and guilt I feel the next day    r rational As hard as it is to believe  five years from now you'll look back on these dark days and you'll probably feel two emotions  the first is you'll be happy to be alive  and  the second is you'll realize how screwed up your family was  and will probably still be  You aren't like them  Amy took advantage of you  Who knows if she was trying to punish her husband for something they disagreed about  or if she just wanted to see how far she could exert her influence   You did the absolutely right and heroic thing in turning your father in to protect your niece  That your mother is blaming you for the situation is further proof of how messed up they are    You need some counseling  and fast  Call your local suicide prevention hotline and ask how you can find a counselor  Trust me  OP  suicide is not the answer  no matter how awful you feel right now  The world needs more good people like you  not one less    Cheers  I'd hang out with you too  a lot of these points i can relate to  sorry man i hope 2017 things start getting better  And honestly i'd like to read what you got    Makes sense  My point being she'd probably still enjoy you taking her out to dinner as well  Dinner and a movie always go hand in hand   Let's get real here  none of us will ever even get close to getting any and should just stop trying  But because we are a determined bunch of fuqers we will keep on trying  I think what you're experiencing is anxiety  I was utterly convinced I would not live to see my 30th birthday  The feeling was pervasive throughout my 20s  Guess what  I'm bearing down on 60 now  and I'm pretty sure I still have a few good years left      Sounds like masochism   How can you demonstrate "tough love" unless you've first demonstrated "love"  That's just being a dick  What is it and why do your parents think it's a scam   Also never trust any "girl" who comes here and says she just wants to talk or offer advice  We are easy meat for catfishers  Yeah  that was definitely my most "Peep Show" moment in real life       So could your problem be just looks   Looks are definitely a problem but they are far from my only problem  I have crippling social anxiety and it's very hard for me to interact with people "well " I spend so much time overanalyzing everything I do and say that talking to people just makes me depressed   What you're describing seems like textbook  disassociation  http   www ptsd va gov professional PTSD overview Dissociative Subtype of PTSD asp      It's a coping mechanism  and often we feel out of body   It works for the immediate discomfort  but can have lasting impacts on cognition and memory   It's how I got misdiagnosed with ADHD as a kid      It's definitely treatable   I highly recommend seeking guidance from a professional therapist or psychiatrist   There is hope  Tell your wife how you feel and that her 30 yr old child is affecting your relationship with her  If she won't try to fix things maybe you should move on  Doesn't sound like you're getting what you need out of the relationship  You're welcome  I have social anxiety so I kind of know what you mean  Why do you feel that you aren't welcome  were people mean to you or something  I'm really serious about keeping you in my prayers  Life will get better  I promise  xoxoxo Refuse to jerk off in front of her anymore  Insist that you get into couples therapy  Thank you  that means a lot  Thats a very good point   better to have one good friend than a bunch of fake friends  Didn't see it on mobile  I misread it and thought you meant she wanted to get back with you  Sorry  But it still holds  Just tell her in order for you to formally move on  you think it would be best to keep our distance  Or something like that   I don't have the energy to do most things lately  I've been drained of all my energy and I don't really know why  oh my god  that was a type for "wanted"  Lol Call your credit card company  Ask them to immediately stop payments to the service  What you have already lost you could hopefully get back from them but I'm sure it says somewhere that you will be charged a cancellation fee  It only took me 5 min to read on how it's a scam  Make sure to research as much as you can when putting your credit card down  If it sounds to good to be true then it usually is   Goodluck  Thank you dude  and I'm 16  Not the first time I've been drunk but definitely the last  It's like a program to teach you how to do social marketing  My parents looked at it too when I showed them and they're telling me it's a scam  I could lose a bunch of money if I don't get it back so kind of stressed out  Thanks  also an instrument sounds like a good idea I'll look into it  Pomeranian  I have a small apartment too and absolutely love sharing it with my tiny couch muffin   Nooo   this is strange  Thank you  right now it's pretty easy for me to get distracted and realise how lucky I am to have come out of this completely fine  Cheers dude  Thanks for the help I will try and contact them and get it back  If I was you I'd keep her away from my sister  She's only going to bring her down  And your parents have the right idea giving her a curfew  It might be hard now but she will be so thankful to her parents when she is older and has a good job  That privelaged white girl won't stick around to see her succeed because if she ever does she'll split  She sounds like a typical parasite  Fall in love with the pigeon and invent wireless electricity  And that changes what  exactly    You're using a vulnerable person's insecurities and flaws for your personal convenience  You're rationalizing your actions by using his unhealthy attachment to you to justify using his income to keep your life comfortable    You get to fuck other men while maintaining the benefits you get from him   You don't get to have your cake and eat it too     Do you guys think it works  I definitely had some crazy experience by not being too available  not even on purpose  I've come to the same conclusion about myself  Had a total breakdown today when packing things for a move  Too much unresolved emotional bullshit since I was a child teenager and too much going on in my life right now  just can't take it anymore  Can't do life   Hope you feel better soon  you're not alone    I understand it sucks   Do you  I too suffered from depression after my children   Do not be afraid to ask for help  or walk away when you need to  Therapy and meds did wonders for me  as did taking some alone time  quiet me time  It's not selfish   You are not a bad mother   Your hormones and brain chemistry work differently   so finding ways to cope and function are going to be different for you   Mothering is a hard job  Really hard  Doing it while having mental illness issues is difficult   Get as much help as you can  and try not to let yourself feel like you are a failure   You admitted you need help  That's a hard step  You can take other hard steps too   You can do this  If I can do it  you can too  Cause I was a huge fucking mess  Best wishes  and keep us informed of your progress   cause you will progress  I'll be thinking of you   Thank you a lot for your reply  Good to hear it might be worth a shot  It sucks to hear about the side effects it gave you though  wish it worked out differently for you  Side effects suck  some more than others  but I have tried over 20 meds in the past in an attempt to regulate my mood  with no luck so far  So there is little choice left for me  Do you remember how often you needed your blood levels checked  About a month ago I was put on Depakote which also requires regular check ups but I can see no improvement yet whatsoever  If dosage increasements turn out to be useless there is only Lithium left to try  Nice to know you felt like a human being again  I am always scared meds will turn me into a zombie  When I was on Aripiprazole or Paliperidone  my emotions just faded away and it was even more horrible than being severely depressed and suicidal  Do you remember which dosage of Lithium you were on when you started noticing any differences   why can't I post an image here when I upload it directly to reddit  Having to go through imgur is an extra step  Try using WhatsApp or Hangouts or any other messaging system that doesn't rely on cellular back channels  Yeah  I have common sense  Being alone is not something anyone should experience  Yeah  anyway the statement holds true    Again Thanks Wow what a way to tell you  But the way it sounds you deserve better  Hope your year turns out to be the best one yet  We can do this  If we can admit we need help we can get better  If you want to talk I am here for you   hugs   That's not what I meant   Being alone  really  gets to you   Common sense may tell you this  but until you've experienced it firsthand  you don't really "understand"  So that's a real thing   This blows my mind     Name it "The house formerly numbered " You are making the best decision to seek out help and support  I hope you continue to have the support of your husband   How do you still even have motivation to do anything  I havent experinced the majority of the stuff you have and can't even bother to get out of bed most days  Does reading reddit count   Thank you for your support and encouragement  It's so nice to hear that others experience the same things as me  I will be sure to update when I can and I hope to be able to see my progress and growth too   If it makes you feel any less alone back in 2013 I lost my mother to cancer  I was 18 almost 19  at the time    It's a complete shit feeling to lose someone you're so close to  The most important thing you can do even though it's good to be there for your younger siblings  is you really need to pay attention to your own mental health and well being    It will get better  Soon you'll stop being sad  as often  and begin reminiscing on all the memories you have with him     Don't be afraid to cry right now but also don't be afraid about not being as sad about it all in the future     The thought of not continuously being sad over losing your father might make you feel guilty later on but remembering happy times and his memory bringing smiles instead of tears is what he would want    I'm incredibly sorry for your loss  My thoughts are with you and your family    Stay safe  cry whenever you need to and remember your dad the way he would want you to remember him   the mind is a muscle  you need to challenge it  relentlessly and not a little bit at a time  in order to grow see progress    I'm studying music at uni college   an area that requires little no knowledge of the subjects and skills one learns during IB   i was in your position once too  all into that self learning thing  but i didn't see progress in my verbal and argumentative skills until after i was challenged by forced to participate in immersed in the difficult group discussions during my classes  and after i wrote  did poorly on  then learned from a couple of dozen research papers  etc  you have to be challenged    to be given tasks that you don't think you'll be able to do    and then you have to do poorly on those tasks  and then improve from there   it sounds like what you're studying in college isn't challenging you enough in a way that satisfies you  otherwise you wouldn't be making this thread  maybe take on a double major  Thank you so much  I wouldn't have been able to make it this far without him and I couldn't imagine my life without him there for me   Yes  My cousin has a greyhound and he pretty much just lounges around waiting for someone to pet him  Super chill dude   I'm against this  Learning is good but also better be able to get along with everyone on their level  That requires also knowing whatever Norm MacDonald likes   Same   Been "getting help" for 10 years and I'm worse off than ever  Maybe I'm lucky to have had a few friends in my life and a mom that cares about my future  But that doesn't mean I haven't felt like I'm alone in some sort of aspect    My original post was just to clarify if this sub is just filled with pure depression or people joking about it or a mix of both with subscribers not realizing it could be both   I'm sorry that you're in this state  and I can only hope you do get joy because you and everyone here deserves it  what server are you on  I am on diabolos guys  No  You're young enough to turn it around  You can lose the weight  probably with minimal telltale signs  If you aren't ready for college  take a year out to sort your shit out   Ah well shit  if you don't mind adding fat you can just eat like crazy and skip gym I guess  D  My problem with being skinny was just the lack of muscles  if you just wanna be not skinny  muscular or not  Then just eat  It's easier to get rejected in your own home than it is to spend time and money outside  Just spitballin here  still don't know why I use it lol  Hahaha I laugh at some also  but I haven't seen them  I would be rolling with laughter  Omword   Now I'm on a hunting spree    Sounds like she's moving on  Very sorry  A lot of the suggestions I received said to do thought replacement  Think of something positive if the images come into my head  This felt unproductive since I have to constantly remind myself to do this  which in turn  reminds me of the images  Also the standard breathing and meditation exercises  Let it be known I didn't give up on these after 1 day   I tried this over multiple months with no change in the way I feel   I'm sorry to hear  I really am  Just please don't assume that your sorrow will last  Especially unplanned AIDS    1  You can change your GP t any time  You don't need to give a reason   2  In England you can self refer to IAPT  There should be a less than 26 week wait from first contact to start of treatment   3  Your doctor can explore "social prescribing"   this is a holistic approach that looks at education  employment  relationships  social life  family life  etc  They can refer you to some providers   I know a bit about MH treatment in England  and I'd be happy to try to help you get the treatment you deserve  Please feel free to PM me  Serenity now  insanity later  edit  a word I have this weird way of thinking that karma's gonna kick in and reward me greatly for all these years of pure garbage   The tv one was late September October  and the spanking one was in the summer  but there have been a few funny ones  Look for one in last 7 10 days titled '"my cat ruined my life" The despair feels palpable today  This is the year when it all starts  We're fucked  We're so fucked  Is there a name for this meme  I like it and I've seen it around Reddit I've just deleted my Facebook and twitter account as they seem so pointless  I'm so sorry for your loss   Believe it or not  Great Danes make great apartment dogs  You do need to get them out and give them exercise  but they sleep a lot and lie around as well   Well it seems to me that's she's giving you a lot of hints that she does  If you don't want to straight up talk to her about loving her and wanting to date her  hey it can be scary to admit that don't judge me  why not start giving hints yourself  Like showing how much you appreciate her and telling her that she made your life for the best   She seems really into you op so don't worry  I wish you the best of luck     Well let me start off by saying that I'm not an electrical engineer and have no aspirations to be one  However  many people in my career field use what we do as a stepping stone towards becoming an electrical engineer  I serve in the United States Air Force as a Civil Engineer and my speciality is electrical systems  If the military is something you have considered I can tell you that it's one of the best ways to get massive experience in the field as well as free schooling once you are out which if you go straight after high school would be as early as age 22 if you wanted  I'm not saying the military is right for everyone but if you live in the United States it's a very viable path that provides you free schooling  tons of on the job experience  and employers on the outside love to hire prior military   She texted me this morning saying she doesn't remember much from last night and that she's sorry about how drunk she got last night and for anything she might have said done   What's the best way to bring up the topic of money  I've always felt awkward asking people for money  even when it's justified  You will face pressure and stress no matter where you are in life  Owning running a business is very challenging  mentally  emotionally  etc   regardless of the size of the business  Unlike others in this thread  I'm not going to tell you to sell and pursue other options  You should work at getting your business to be more enjoyable for you  You being the CEO have that power  You could hire people to take some of the pressure off  make those tough business decisions for you  At 20 years old  you are in a very impressive place in life  but you are also only 20 and do not have the experience on the emotional end to detach yourself from the tough choices you will need to face  Hire a human resources department to handle the hiring and firing  since that seems to be taking its toll on you  Hire some trustworthy managers to handle the day to day details that will wear on you over time  And remember  you are 20  You should be out having fun and hanging with friends and falling in love  People work to live  they don't live to work  Find a way to balance both   I'm very sorry for your loss    Honestly  I think the best thing you can do for your younger siblings is let them see that you're hurting  so they know it's OK that they're hurting too  But everybody needs to find their own way through grief  Exactly   There's a reason why we're all FA  there's no hope for us   This was after we started talking to each other  after we shared our interests and found that a lot of them were common   The hell if I know  I think I love your dad  He hit exactly the right note   And maybe your mom will come around in time   Anyway  congrats  Yep   Need to stop ignoring red flags  Thanks for the reply GraniteMarker  I wasn't sure if anyone would want to talk to a person like me  Apart from criminals like my father there aren't many people as low and sickening as myself    I know my family is broken  it's been shattered but not apart for years now  My brother's and I have always been on the same team though  we were supposed to grow old and help each other navigate through life    That won't happen now  and while Amy may have started the ball rolling I only nudged it along farther  Whether or not they had marital discourse means nothing  I was a brother  holding the ultimate trust of Andrew  Everyone saw me and Amy growing closer but he trusted me enough to not believe I would ever let this happen    It's nice to hear or see the words good people  however I don't know how you could possibly say that about a person who's just told you he abused the trust vested in him by family members  I could see it if I had offered more than heartbreak and pain  but that's what they've all gotten from me    I have been considering talking to a professional  mainly because I'm terrified to do the deed  What's stopping me is the knowledge that whatever a counsellor might say to me makes no difference to my family  After all  this isn't about me anymore  I've learned a real hard lesson about selflessness  While we might be a broken family  it's still my family and I want nothing else than to be with them    I don't think I want to go on without them  I know I could  i just won't  I was suicidal even before knowing what my Dad did  I don't want to imagine what I'll feel like after I've digested this last month    Thanks again Granite   50 in 07 ALL HAIL THE NEW PIGEON LORD I have been on lithium for about 2 years now  Overall  it's been a good experience  I am generally emotionally stable  In the beginning  there was severe numbness for me  I wasn't really suicidal anymore  but I was extremely lethargic and nihilistic  Over time that has worn off  but be prepared to feel like a zombie at first  There are a couple physical side effects as well  First  the shaking  It's gone down a lot now  but when I started taking it my hand tremors were very noticeable  I couldn't even hold a pencil  Those died down though  Another thing is weight gain  Other then that there weren't really any other significant side effects  For me  lithium has been great  but I take it for bipolar disorder  Hope this helps   Real world works if you're attractive  believe me I've tried  I've done cold approaches  even spoke with girls randomly in my classes  Unless you're good looking that doesn't work  That and almost every girl I talk to doesn't share similar interests  Add to the fact that I'm fat on top of that  and nobody wins  I am trying to lose weight though  I'm on Gilgamesh but I don't mind starting over I just hate people  not  depressed like some people on here I don't think I can afford couples therapy but I will start looking into it  I don't want to lose my wife and this isn't healthy behavior   I'm not sure what I've done wrong to end up in this predicament  Maybe I should have never agreed to masturbate Infront of her in the first place  Hugs  I'm sorry   He play such a warm caring person   Apparently he was like that in like     Such people make the world a better  and their leaving leaves a shadow     However the brightness of the light of their life makes the shadow only a small gray thing of loss  I am from Switzerland and don't know much about your schooling system but are there extra classes to take to keep you busy  Maybe there you also find some cool people which can influence you in a positive way  There are also some awesome youtube videos where you can learn additional things about programming  But please do me a favour    find yourself also a hobby off the computer  It is really important that you also get out of the house  sport  photography  cook etc    As for your parents  Parents shouldn't say stuff like that but ignoring them trying to be nice to you until you move out  do you really think that is the solution  Does it hurt trying to make this work  If it doesn't at least you can say you tried your best from your side  Good luck for your 2017  Hey  I wish I knew what to say    I'm sorry  But I'm glad she has you and the others  Sorry to hear we're in the same boat  I've sort of only recently realised that I have the right for boundaries  too  Sounds like you have established healthy ones  and are going about it very maturely  Do you get back lash from your mother for this  How do you handle the emotional hurt and not taking her words to heart   Thank you  hugs  Just by admitting you need help is huge progress   Not only is it hard to admit to ourselves   but to others as well  And you did so publicly  That's pretty impressive in my book  I know you will thrive  I hope you know that as well   Well u just took the first step  U admitted u need help  I wish u nothing but the best  I hope u keep your appt and get the help u need  Its not failure  Ur a strong person and u got this      only in LA  This city and its people get more absurd everyday  Lol sad how the poor countries that did nothing to contribute to global warming will be the first to perish  I wonder how long before life in developed countries will be massively impacted by global warming though Well that should definitely be a big red flag and hope you move on and find a better person   Honestly I think the description of the no interest girl was right up my alley  Kinda messed up but I think my idea of the perfect relationship is just someone that's there physically  but not necessarily that you're always talking and doing things with   Sai is not compatible with Mac  It's more common than you think  It takes a lot of strength to realise you can't do something  I hope you get the help you need   Oh I did read my cat ruined my life one   Smh Shes obviously going through something that shes not ready to tell you about yet  6 months may seem like a long time but in my experience some people take longer to fully open up to a partner than the others   The way i see it you have two options  1  End it 2  Wait it out for awhile longer and be there for her  She obviously cares about you and if you stick through it with her  she will care for you even more in the end once her problems have passed   As the other commenter stated  there really is no one like that  I think people greatly underestimate the amount of work people put to have successful lives and relationships   I have several friends in their early 20s who keep jumping from a failed relationship to a failed relationship because they aren't wiling to change an iota of themselves  Too weak to give up sex and intimacy until they actually find someone worthwhile  completely refuse following a healthy diet and an exercise routine  and complete lack of hobbies and interests   Every action they take in all aspects of life is an indicator that they're not willing to do anything to better their prospects in both life and relationships  They just keep adding to their baggage   I love them and I wish they could change  Well  you could work on developing a rewarding career so that you have something positive going on in your life   It seems like the happier people here are the ones who have jobs that they like   Most people spend a lot more time at work than they do with loved ones  after all    Fair enough  If you're happy with yourself and not just a self loathing pity partier like many people here then good on ya   Hey  is there anyone in your life that could come over for a couple of hours and just help you clean up a bit  I know the last time I had a full blown meltdown  hasn't showered in days  disgusting room no clean underwear etc  I very honestly told my father that I was struggling and couldn't do it  I took a shower and washed my hair while he did some of my laundry  Seriously  immediately things felt a little less hopeless  because something managed to get done  If there's no one who can help you even just go wash your face take a shower when you read this  I know it feels pointless or impossible but if you can manage to finish one very small task you might just feel a little better  or at least cleaner   Maybe  this  http   www npr org sections money 2014 10 16 356176018 the most popular jobs for the rich middle class and poor  can help you out  There are just some examples and pretty common one so i don't know how they can be that useful    I just wanted to say that sometimes it's easier to go by what you don't want to do  For example write down some subjects like Art  Engineering  Medicine Health care     and then cross whatever you're sure you don't want to follow  Then go over each area and think of jobs for each one and research them   Sry I can't be of much help    take care Sometimes   dead is betta No  don't do this   I'm an FA woman over 40  but there's nothing that you've described about yourself that would have been a dealbreaker for fat  unattractive  socially isolated  17 year old me all those years ago  There are other young women out there today in exactly my predicament    they are shunned socially for their weight  their features  their disabilities  their chronic illnesses  or other things outside of their control  in spite of being kind  generous  smart people  When you start college  look for them  Tell me something good about your friend   Thanks  Same to you and yours  circumstances notwithstanding  I get that you don't want to lose her  however you can't just give in to anyone like that man  If you absolutely can't afford therapy then all you need to do is stop giving in  You don't want to have most of your life ahead of you full of just coming home and jerking off to were your penis is in so much pain  That's not healthy  for you physically and your relationship   Sounds like your mom associates shame with gayness or bisexuality  Talk to her about it  explain it in your own terms  You're the exact same child as you have been  I guess you already evaluated this possibility but why don't you message the girl the one you said that saw you  and ask her what you did  Be honest  tell her you don't remember a thing    If she never replies not even to tell you how bad it was what you did  do yourself a favor and forget about her  It takes months but it's the only way out  "friends" I think loving someone is actually just liking someone for being alive  so long as you think the same way  And it's someone to grow with  For most of us you hit a certain age  there are only so many hours in the day  and apart from what you  do  together  even taking a nap together   life is mostly stagnant   Thanks  he's pretty great  I'm hoping she does too     Just because there's no correlation in this study doesn't mean it doesn't help a subset of people    Unless it makes some people's infections worse  that's exactly what it means  They say it eventually subsides in most people whether they get tonsilllectomy or not  Thank you  Yeah I did my best  I just said I just liked who I liked and I couldn't help it  I'm kind of done being ashamed of it  so I'm just like okay  that's done  I'm out of the closet to everyone immediately important  So she'll have to come around but I refuse to hate myself any more   Whilst I agree with your pissed off sentiment at the world  you can't tell people dating isn't better than being alone based purely off your own negative experience  I'm sure I speak for everyone else when I say we'd quite like to give that a go ourselves and see if it goes any better  Thank you  I should've say "Sometime" Thank you  Sometimes people are conflicted about their feelings  liking some things in a SO but being repelled by others  If that's it  she has to sort this out for herself because you shouldn't change to please her  I agree with the other poster that giving it time and not too much deep thought will be a good course of action  Sometimes there is no "Why " to be determined because attraction is not a choice  Or stress you out  I don't believe that  She is here for a reason and I don't think it is much easier for girls than it is for guys here  Lets not undermine her "success story" on this subreddit because of her gender   This is great perspective on the issue of communication  If my wife was being this way and acknowledged something was wrong but would night talk  I would be very upset   But yes  6 months is still relatively new  and I think the best option would be to ask your girlfriend IF and WHEN she will ever share it with you  Tell her you care and need to know so you can deal with it together   All the best  thats the first thing i sent her when i woke up    just a 'normal' message like wow we were fucked up last night i dont remember anything etc    i think i should get over her but i really dont want to  i like thinking about her  i love being with her  if i dont have her then honestly i dont see the point in going out or even studying anymore      I just told her it hurt too much to lie to everyone  What bothers me the most is that she managed to make it all about her  It was just like when I tried telling them i was depressed in high school  guess what  still am   She just said shit like well you think too much you've always been intense  I can't believe you took three years to say anything  blah blah   Like I get that I don't have kids and I don't know what this feels like  but it's like can't you at least give me the benefit of the doubt and try to understand where I'm coming from  Guess not   Math's the big one in high school  Take AP Calculus and AP Physics  Mechanics and E M   Make sure you really really understand all your math assignments  Obvious top picks for schools are MIT and Caltech  you can get whole lists of schools ranked by program quality  Google it  The school name is less important than what you do there  though  take relevant classes  get good grades  do a good capstone project   Plan to apply for internships every summer in college  STEM interns actually get paid and it looks really good on your resume to graduate with experience     Source  am electrical engineer  No  because most people on Reddit aren't masters of linguistics and you won't get a lot of variety   Ah  Thanks for helping me  I will probably join gym someday when I am fatty   haha You've got a lot going on  No wonder you're having a rough time  That would throw anybody for a loop  So look for someone else who is a non smoker if it's a deal breaker   To add a bit to what  u FMP11 has said  as it's good advice   I do have a small suggestion  but of course it will require a bit of boldness on your part  It seems clich and even cheesy  but ask her to go see a movie with you  If she agrees  great  If she doesn't  don't be discouraged  because she may legitimately be busy or uncertain  It does not necessarily mean she isn't interested  If it does happen  give it some time and find another time with which to ask her out  but keep it simple  in this case  maybe a walk in the park  In the case of if she agrees to the movie though  after a bit of time  but still with plenty of time in advance  ask her if she would be up for going out to lunch beforehand  Depending on your budget  this could be different things  If you can afford it  take her out to a restaurant rather than a fast food joint  but nothing too fancy  First dates should be somewhat casual after all  Make sure she would be alright with the type of food served at the place  so have a couple places in mind before you ask if she would enjoy a specific one  If all goes well  you should have a lovely  comfortable first date for the both of you  Keep the conversation light  and don't get to deep into worrying about what to say  Sounds like you haven't had much trouble in your conversations  but I wouldn't want to steer you towards making her feel uncomfortable by asking her how she feels towards you while you're out and about  If all goes well and she's still smiling by the end of the night  I would say express your feelings when you take her home  Just my opinion on the matter  but I wish you luck  my friend  I have considered that  Its the path that will most likely happen if i don't have the balls to do it  Thanks for not trolling I appreciate it as this sub is the only place I can really open up  Thanks for your reply  Yeah I've been googling since I posted that and it seems lots of math  I'm not bad at math but I definitely need to devote myself to it more  Being a freshmen in high school I really have no idea what some good colleges for electrical engineering so that's something I'll probably get help with later   again thanks for the reply  Thanks man  I am currently dieting and exercising more to try and lose the weight before im off at college   Thanks for the reply  Yeah I am aware that you can go through the military I just don't feel like that would be my thing  I'm just gonna slowly try to figure it out as I go through high school and hopefully it'll work out  This is so true  I also agree we FA people ought to give other FA people a chance  just like we wish someone would take that chance on us  I work for a multi billion dollar financial tech company with offices all over the world  We have a hierarchy in place where we eliminate the stress of position based responsibilities  Maybe it would be worthwhile for you to investigate a new structure for your company that you could implement easily since your company is small  in terms of people   If you ever want to chat about it  feel free to message me  I've also been in leadership positions before   Thank you very much  If I try to socialize at college I will take your suggestion into question  I appreciate the advice very much  I'll try giving some hints  although I feel like I'll be a little obvious  Thanks  Holy fucking shit all of these things happens to me CONSTANTLY  Make sure to hit the "monetize" button  You can google where it is  Clich and cheesy things aren't all bad  besides she loves movies so that's a good idea  I suppose I could try it  I'm not very bold but I have a good feeling  Thanks  Can you elaborate on why you see this as bad advice   Do you hold a position of anti intellectualism  This is less rare than you might think  I'm not certain that what you're describing is exactly the same  but it's at least quite similar to a fetish typically called "vore"  for context as to why  think of words that typically use that term as a suffix  like carnivore omnivore  etc    Confronting it honestly and labeling it as a fetish or guilty pleasure  I'm pretty sure we can take you at your word  I can understand the self consciousness   everyone's got their tics  kinks  or otherwise offbeat fascinations that they probably would rather not make familial affairs of   but there are also communities out there that could relate to you  if you haven't already tried looking   If you haven't already seen it and you need something to satisfy the interest  let me suggest an anime  if you're into that at all  called Attack on Titan  Frankly  I eventually lost the stomach for it  awful pun not intended nor rescinded   but even from the point of view of someone who couldn't necessarily find much satisfaction from that angle  it also had an interesting and rather subversively political storyline   tldr  You do you  don't worry about this being too big a deal  There are others who can relate  Congratulations    My epiphany was 3 years ago when I was like OH SHIT I LIKE CHICKS and then I was afraid I would be gay for a while but then a few months ago I was like nope I'm bi and lean to adds women  And if I am gay "in the end " whatever that means  whatever  It makes me happy  I like being happy   There's a big community waiting for you  I hope you're not going through a ton of self loathing like I did  cuz nothing feels better than being myself  She sounds amazing and brave  I bet she had the most interesting stories to tell  You should write them down  Ask around all who knew her for them  They would make a great book I know I'm not normal I'm weird and that'll keep me alone forever I've written songs for girls but that won't do me any good  Title says it You seem to already have a plan  so it's pretty good for a start   Also  for what this man that told you that a business degree is useless because you don't come from those "popular universities"  those people are juste some sheep following the popular opinion  If you've chosen to do this degree  I imagine that even if you don't know what you want to do  it's because it is what's please you the most  So I guess that if you're very interested and focused into it and have projects  all you have to do is find motivation and pass your degree and succeed to it  No matter where you come from  if you're good and full into what you do  you will do great things   What I said won't help you much  but after all this is your choice  and even if you're not sure now  it'll get better and you'll see from the experience if it suits you well  or not   Hope you're will be okay with it   I'm sure you will succeed easily    I appreciate your advice  I'll be honest I'm kind of the pussy in the relationship I should have stopped a long time ago when it was getting weird  My wife is very attractive  My friends always joke she's out of my league so I'm always worried she's gonna leave me   But she's the one with no job and cock obsession so I don't know why I feel like I'm the loser in the relationship  It's funny how that theme seems to extrapolate to life in general  It's always the innocent that suffer the most from the deeds of the guilty   I never feel like going for a run until I am lying in bed I'll see her face to face in like 9 10 days unless i hear from her or try again  I'm nervous so i might just wait and feel it out when i see her on campus then  Then deal with the smoking  Handy tip   if the smell bothers you take up smoking  You'll get used to it in no time   You don't look forever alone at all   You'll find someone   I only wish I could feel this  I am religious  But I always say I believe the gospel not the church  The organised religion part is run by men women etc and therefore is always gonna be wrong coz even with the best will in the world  we're human and we get it wrong  I believe in the core values my religion has to offer but sometimes  more often than I'd like to think about  it gets corrupted by human beings  But a religion that is basically telling me to love God and love each other  I can get behind that   I deal with a lot of the same issues you mentioned OP  My mind gets stuck replaying insignificant interactions from the day  old situations  I worry way too much about what people think of me and it can be crippling   What's helps me is to recognize when I get stuck in that hamster wheel in my mind and remind myself  is what I'm worried about going to matter in a week  Month  Year  Five years   The answer is almost always no  And truth is  most people aren't as worried as you think they are about you  they are preoccupied with their own actions just as you are about yours now  It helps me to take a step back and realize that minor things like conversations and interactions are pretty unremarkable in our lives as a whole and when you look back on your life you probably won't remember most of the day to day stuff you worry about   this sub sucks   That old business man was an ass to everyone around him anyway  Honestly what you said helps me a lot  The reassurance makes me feel better  I'm just freaking out  Thank you and your comment is appreciated     You're by all means NOT a loser  I assume you love her and it sucks if you lose someone you love obviously  You don't have to lose her though  she just needs to get better  However it seems as though she's kind of controlling you in the relationship in a very unhealthy way  She will get better with time hopefully  By the way if you have any good friends or anyone you know that is good at resolving problems maybe they can counsel you since you can't afford a professional counselor  ANY counseling is better than none  Pleasing your significant other is an amazing thing but when it gets to be unhealthy is when you need to stop  You can't keep doing that to yourself OP  It'll only get worse for you and her from her on out if you continue to give in  I wish you and her the best of luck  and hopefully things can return as close to normal as possible  Happy New Years   I feel this way about a guy to a massive extent  And it's SO stupid  He has a girlfriend  And I just can't get the motherfucker out of my head  Have you looked into the process for her to get a green card via marriage to you  I don't believe it is as simple as get married  get green card  live happily ever after  Good job honey  I had ppd as well and new motherhood was a nightmare for me  I hope they get you on the right meds  and know that you aren't alone  We all feel like failures now and then  You are a good mother who is at her breaking point  You'll feel much better after you get the help you need  It's honestly ridiculous how old fashioned those views are  It's not like you have a kid just to make it  you have a kid to raise it  guide it  see it through  and she's not acting like a good role model  I'm sorry you have to be the adult in this situation     there is  nothing  wrong with your preference  and there's  no  reason she should make you feel badly for this  She should treat it like the blessing that it is  She can only be attracted to one gender  but you have the opportunity to find a soulmate or whatever you want in any all genders  I know it hurts for her to be invalidating this  but just try to keep your eyes open to the positives of this  it's out there  and whether she likes it or not you can't and shouldn't put it away  It's easier said than done  but try not to let her get to you  The world is your multi gendered oyster  and you can pick whoever you want  you're not limited to one gender  you have the opportunity for different kinds of love  different kinds of sex  different relationship dynamics  and you have lots more places to look  I hope she comes round to this  and hopefully your dad's open mindedness rubs off on her  Best of luck and happy New Year    You sound strong to me  Admitting you need help is a huge step  One step I'm still too afraid to make  It's scary  You've told your husband and he's there to support you  I hope you follow through with the referral  Hugs   You did the right thing by breaking up with him  He shows signs of possesivness which is never good in a relationship    And a man in his 30s should be mature enough to handle an argument without it getying out of hand  Always welcome       which is non professional prostitutes    women and girls 20 50 old   who get some extra money during the weekend  sometimes only when the husband is away    Didn't even know that kind of a thing existed You mean ordinary people willing to have sex with you just for extra money   I know  But it would seem like instead of trying to fix a forever alone  there is a different way to approach it   Sounds to me like you got yourself a pet pigeon now  Yep  Funnily enough though  I actually found making friends more difficult when I was working full time because I'd have no goddamn energy  The wallet would be willing but the flesh was weak   Happy people don't act like this    And this is the issue right here    He refused to come down to Christmas dinner this year  I was really upset about this and I started crying  Why would you be upset and start crying   That was about him and not you   There is no reason for you to take that personally   He is miserable and what you told the relatives was not a lie  He is ill  but at this point  the illness is probably a more advanced form of depression   There is no reason to be upset if he refuses to meet with your guests  too   They are your guest  there is no reason for him to make them feel welcome   So you can understand  he feels miserable and wretched  and doesn't want others to see him  become fodder for their gossip  and judge him   There is nothing wrong with him choosing to remain confined while they are there   Counseling  would be very beneficial for him   But it would be beneficial for you as well   Just so you could maybe figure out why you take his mental issues to personally   As far as he goes  since he is still living in your parents' home  they can force him to go to counseling  or tell him that he can't remain in their home  It does not  I've been this way since I was a kid and I love being alone  There is only a problem with being alone when you can't face who you really are and don't value yourself   No she's not  I looked through your posts  6 months ago you posted about it   I hope he really does think about it and realizes what he means to you  I don't think he doesn't want to   he just finds it hard and hurtful to get very attached because of his depression as I see it    "I don't know how to ever find that again   " remember things will find its way to better situation even though emotionally you would think that life depends on that one person and life would be somehow tasteless without them and you may never find someone to replace them  think that every person we humans meet is special to us and stays within us specially the ones we love has the most impact  so that's normal  things will get better and you will feel better  give it sometime and hopefully things works out the best for both of you Ah  I get it now  never tried out that feature  spectated my cousin once while playing Skyrim but he didn't let me control it because he was afraid that I'm going to quit to the menu and delete his character  His suspicions were right though   He should see a therapist imo  Sounds like depression   personality dissorder of some kind  Or just being a jerk   I'm not a "social" person though  In fact I push people away who want to be my friend    Can't is the problem  The problem is also you value relationships too much and place your self value on imaginary things that actually aren't what you think they are   Thank you  I'm not sure she will listen  It always goes back to all she's done for my children when they were 14 and 8  For a school year  Almost as if she sacrifices so much   I kissed my parents on the cheek in past years  and I was still quite lonely  thank you for your reply Alone all my life too but my case I never received parental love so I am a little messed up  I guess this is how it is for you  which is a good thing   I sometimes feel this desesperation when I am alone and I've been in my computer for too long or I've reading about people who have SOs and such   I don't have anyone to miss but I still feel alone  How is it easier for a girl to leave the house by herself than a guy to leave the house by himself  That makes no sense  Look up the studies on heavy social media use and depression  I don't think that sort of thing can ever really alleviate loneliness in a lasting way  Thank you I'm looking forward to getting help A great idea would be to start going to a speaking club like toastmasters  They are cheap  available anywhere  and really low key  Sounding more intelligent really comes down to saying less and saying it with controlled timing  Postpartum depression can rear its head whenever  If you've had these feelings in the past  then it's great you're wise enough to reach out  Keep up a positive attitude even when things are bleak  Keep going for your son      Thank you I hope you can find the strength and support you need and if you need someone to talk to I am here for you  I'm in the same thing right now lmao  Hopefully someone would answer our prayers Thank you for the encouraging words  That you have schizo  From what I know  it can be overcome or at least you can try your best to overcome it and try to integrate into society and have a regular social life  I'm no psychologist but I just looked up schizo and this is the first thing that came up   "Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness  One of the biggest myths around the illness is that it isnt treatable  With the right supports  people can work or volunteer  be active in their own care  and contribute to their communities"  So I wouldn't give up  Yes you have various mental disorders and you're a lesbian that your family hates  So what  Those may make it difficult for you to have a normal life but it doesn't mean its impossible  If you are still having suicidal thoughts  I would just leave them as your thoughts  Just know that you're young and very attractive  at least you have that going for yourself  Just think positive and get help if you need so  That's all im saying   How can you look that  which has no life  Okay  one comment of mine isnt going to get you out of this  so here are some things you can do   You can pm me and stay in touch if you want  I can talk to you while you remain faceless to me    rsuicidewatch might be able to help you with the thoughts you have  If you arent already  go see a psychiatrist that might have medical advice or a family doctor   Go to a therapist  psychologist to talk about what you are experiencing  Try it once it might help   Be open to your gf about what you are experiencing  She will probably support you through these situations  Also reach out to close friends  They can help you more then you might think    Yeah  Whenever I'm by myself I find myself talking out loud or humming  I don't know why I do it  but it seems to keep me energized  Haha  Edited for some major typing errors  still typing on my phone If you don't get an answer here  you may want to try  r gaming  Interesting you should mention that  One of the people in our group was this hot girl that kept snapping photos with her BF throughout the whole night  Once the drugs wore off  she became really depressed and started opening up about her anxiety and insecurities  YOU ARE A FANTASTIC MUM    So many of us are the same struggling on and on not wanting to admit we are having a hard time with parenting and other problems    I went passed breaking point at easter I in a red mist of anger with my then not very supportive dh 4 yrs of broken sleep 2 sen children and 1normal one  during an arguemnent stabbed myself in the arm  Was nearly admitted to a mh unit social services got involved still are now  What really hurt was so so many people afterwards said we could see you going downhill but never said anything to me thing is if somebody said I can see your having problems I wouldn't of got into the state I got in   Again you are a fantastic mum your saying I need help  Fantastic mums know when they need help and they reach out and grab the help with both hands Be yourself  be honest to the people you trust and everything will be fine  You could talk to your friends aboit how you feel  They will probably understand  Open and honest most of the times is the way to go Definitely make sure to name it after a meme so all of your neighbors don't understand and or dislike you before even meeting you Don't sweat it really  Their opinions don't matter anymore  They're gone and you're still you  One day  you'll find someone better  And she'll love you for you no matter how bad you think you're doing    First  stop and breathe   You did it   You made it   Now you get to decide what to do next   Second  decide   And remember that you have a LOT of choices  1  Stay CEO  2  Find a new CEO and downgrade yourself operationally  doesn't have to change the ownership of the company  though it usually will change it a bit   3  Find a new CEO and leave the company  again  may not change the ownership question   4  Exit completely  sell off the business    The up side is that you can essentially make this choice for yourself at this point   But if you wait too long  you mentioned a board   they can take control from you if things get out of hand   So your self realization that you're drowning is a GOOD thing   It's just now your number 1 priority to figure out how to handle it   Finding a new CEO could be the trick   This is essentially how Apple worked   Steve Jobs was the mouth  Woz was the brains   This isn't a perfect example  Woz never wanted to be anything other than the tech guru that he is and actually NEEDED Jobs    But it's enough of a fair comparison that you can see how this dichotomy would work   Any CEO worth their salt will WANT some ownership interest in the firm   this is also a good thing    it keeps them motivated   So you'd have to be willing to do this   The downside  of course  is that you're no longer in control   Sure  you could give yourself the Chairmanship role on the Board  for example  and keep that power  which is recommended    But day to day operational concerns would sit with someone else    and  most likely  someone who has the business acumen to worry about the D2D   Other folks are recommending the complete exit   I'm not always sold on this   You built this baby from the ground up    so staying with it  especially if you still like the technical aspect of what your firm does  is a good way to keep yourself intellectually active   Ultimately  though  the key is to do what makes you happy   If you aren't happy  your work will suffer  which will impact your firm today   and your mental health will suffer  it seems it already is    Congratulations on your success   Good luck with your choice  How did you ruin it  How was everything going great  Join us over at r mommit we will love to talk to you there  Yeah I need a couch potatoes of sorts  I do work long hours but like I said my fianc and I have opposite schedules so the dog won't be completely alone all the time  Are they active when they want   My moms Catholic too  I feel your pain homie  Hey  It's hard to say whether something has happened to you but what you describe sounds a little unusual   Do you have any memories of your early childhood  Do you remember certain things  people   specifically   I also started masturbation really young and I also somehow connected it to some forms of punishment  not sure for whom though   So it might be that you're blocking some memories  but maybe you just experienced masturbation and sexuality in a different way than others do  it's a wide spectrum   You respect animals now  so that shows it wasn't anything permanent or evil   Maybe find a therapist to find out about possible blocked memories  Also you could think about exploring your sexuality in a different way  I mean  there are many ways people live theirs  if you're into the whole 'dominance  punishment  etc    There's nothing wrong with that as long as it's consensual   Oh my god hun  I am sorry this has happened to you and your family  Losing loved ones is inevitable  The worst part is most of the time we can't prepare for when it will happen and throws us all off guard  Shocks us and breaks us down  Look to the good memories when you can and ask yourself what would you father want from you is he was still here with you  Possibly just your happiness  Stay with your loved ones and stay close for now   18 Wow you sound like me  Similar age  all  yes all my friends now have girlfriends and are all pretty serious and settled  When ever we socialise they always bring the girls so its couples  up to the point where i dont go out anymore because i feel so uncomfortable   I hope 2017 is a better year for you and me both Yea but I knew many of the people  is there something that was kinda driving them away from me  was I boring  I don't have a lot of friends but the few I have are close   They all got married within the past few years  It's an unfortunate part of growing older     I guess the good news is now that they are all married  I won't have to go to any more weddings alone  Hi there  First point   congratulations at driving to your own success  it seems like a legendary effort  Nothing can take this away from you  you have done awesome things  Building a business of that size here in  au is amazing   The meetings  the grind  it is  and will always be relentless  Scaling a business is difficult  and there is so much mundane stuff that needs to keep happening  it wont go away    Some people are saying to cash out  but if you are passionate about your business  you are not necessarily going to want to do that  It's your baby    So  think about the bits you dont like doing and delegate  You can run the company  but still have a CEO to do the day to day CEO stuff  Work on a general charter  add some middle management  It comes with a small cost  but will steady the business   im a long time senior middle manager  what we do is put in and maintain that governance so the exec can go do the exec stuff without stressing about the BAU stuff     Well done and good luck  Tbh I think that's why we FA's fail over and over again  We should not try harder on anything but burning all the small but yet standing bridges we got left won't help us out reaching any decent goals that might be in your reach  My goal 2017 is to eat less and quit tobacco alcohol  will I be an underachieving  kissless  guy with low confidence income this year as well  Yup but giving up everything will just lead to even more severe depression that might lead to suicide in the end    Keep fighting fellow robots  When I'm by myself  if I'm thinking through a conversation or monologue or whatever  eventually I'll whisper out a sentence of it  and then I'll reflexively  seriously  no idea why  append "  he said" to the end of the sentence  It's like I'm instinctively trying to disown that I just did that   I hate that I do this  because it feels so odd  but I literally can't make myself stop  I'm just glad it seems to  only  happen when I'm alone  though I cringe thinking of the day when I only  think  I'm alone and someone overhears me being weird  holy SHIT     i just saw that picture and WOW   if OP is FA  the rest of us are fucked  Thank you  it's incredibly difficult to admit that I cannot do this without help and it's incredibly difficult to realize that this is not my fault  I hope you are getting the help you need and are on your way to recovery and happiness   hugs  Dude  I'm 17 and I'm balding  It started when was about to turn 16 and I was  shattered   15 was no age to worry about thinning hair  bald spots and growing your hair out so that you could hide them  But that's what happened  And I stressed about it  Which lead to  Nothing  It didn't change the circumstance whatsoever  so what's the point worrying about it  I know it sucks  but that's the way it is    Don't sweat it too much     I'm the same way  I dunno if this will apply to you  but I have Aspergers and I can initially force myself to be more interactive in social situations but eventually my focus and effort diminishes naturally and then I just kind of zone out into my own world and thoughts  I haven't figured out a solution to this behavior for me yet  People fail semesters all the time  I failed two things this past year and I know many people who fucked up at least once    College is harder than most think and if you slip up once it could screw you over later  Most important thing you need to remember is that you're not stupid  I told myself that and it only made shit worse    As to whether or not it will influence your future studies depends on many things like the degree you're planning on doing  your school marks  how badly you failed  the university rules etc etc    A good place to start would be to email someone at the universities you're planning on going to and finding out if you can continue your current degree with them and if you'll need to reapply for college    Unless there's something like academic dishonesty standing in your way I see no reason why you won't be able to continue at a new university    Best of luck man  Just keep a level head and things should be fine Hate to be Mr  Center of Attention and all     but oh my god this sounds like something one of my old best friends would write to me  Same situation  I always gave advice for practically nothing      What are the freaking chances Obvious is good  Girls need the confirmation or question anything  Just go for it   There's people on this sub over 50  There's an alternate sub for 30   We've heard the same spiel a million times whenever one of the posts here hits r all   Don't assume that   Tell us how it goes yeah  This is perhaps a question your doctor can answer better than anyone else  I feel your pain  Truly i do  Depression and anxiety is a bitch and something that I also struggle with  I certainly am no expert at giving advice but I can say one thing that's helped a lot lately is keeping a journal of my thoughts and feelings  it's helped work through a lot of problems and has helped me make some tough decisions  I dunno    maybe it can help you too    I've been through college Math Calculus and in my opinion if you get into it it can actually be pretty fun and rewarding  Definitely not as fun as four months in SE Asia haha    Hang in there  friend  Making this post was a good idea cause I know just writing all that down got you thinking even harder about it   I hope your new years is better than the eve   Sounds like your mom is getting frustrated with you being sick   Welcome  btw   New Year's day is going ok   Danger made breakfast and we went for a walk and now the baby is napping   New years eve I was asleep by 1030  Danger stayed up so he could see if he could see any fireworks  no     This forum contains mostly depressed people who never had a girlfriend and or have no friends  This is usually the primary cause of the depression  Occasionally  people make threads that have a "funny" way to demonstrate FA to make themselves and others feel better  There is a reason why suicide links are on the right side  Most  not all  of the people are depressed from what I have seen  Thanks ill try it today  Last thing  If you ever need someone to listen to you when you're feeling depressed feel free to send me a PM  Like i said i'm going through it too and sometimes it helps to just have someone you can't rant to   Self care  never  means selfishness  You can't take care of anyone else unless you take care of yourself first  especially not your husband or your child  I probably don't qualify to answer this  but  oh well  I'm a "normie" but I've always had near crippling social anxiety  As a little girl  the thought of going to school and being with people I didn't know made me cry every morning on the way there  I somehow managed to make friends along the way  probably because they pitied me  So  going into teenage years  what do a lot of us do  Get jobs  I worked retail and could not handle approaching customers  Like shook and stumbled over words and ran away at the quickest chance   I don't know how I got the job   My therapist gave me very similar advice you all read here regularly  "Start by just putting yourself in a public place  Get used to being looked at  possibly being interacted with  Then  when you're comfortable there  then try just saying hi to a person that walks by" things like that and take your interactions to another level  Exposure  It worked  It really worked  It took MONTHS but retraining your method of thinking is never quick  but it has the most out lasting result of anything else  like medication   I still feel little shakes and my temperature rise when I'm in conversations with people I don't know  but the desire to flee has completely left  So the advice sucks in the sense that it's not an instant thing  You'll get rejected  or people can be assholes and just be like "get the fuck away from me"  And part of the experience is learning how to handle the negative reactions  That might actually be the hardest part  It's not good advice to find a partner directly  But if you have anxiety talking to people  it's a great place to start  If you can train your brain to be comfortable with conversing with all types of people  male  female  young  old  maybe it will be less nerve wracking when you're trying to talk to a person you're interested in   Thanks  Ok  by "gamer" I just mean someone who plays games non casually     casual games don't count 11  11  It's not about the type of games that makes someone a casual gamer or not  it's about their dedication to the games they play   If someone is obsessed with Candy Crush and spends every waking minute thinking about it and spends all of their free time playing it even when they have alternative forms of entertainment available to them  then I would consider them a "gamer " However  if they only play the game when they're on the shitter and can't do anything else  I wouldn't really consider them a "gamer " just someone who plays games casually     yeah  there was such little content for women that they had to invent a word for games geared towards women  I don't think they invented the word just because of this  I think they needed a word to define games that were basically the opposite of bishojo gal games that were targeted towards men  That actually helped alot  its nice to have a visual example  I do not and choose not to believe superstitions like these  To me its ridiculous  but it is a good excuse to kiss someone if you never had  Maybe if you were lucky  you could get that first kiss with some drunk lady on NYE    i was overwhelmed with an indescribable amount of sadness and grief while i watched people cheering and embracing their loved ones under a dazzling spectacle of beautiful pulsating colors that symbolized happiness  joy and a fresh start  while i sit silently alone beside a tree trying to hold back tears in a park that was mostly surrounded by happy couples and families   This is so poetic   and so horribly sad   Perfect way to describe it  I would add too that sticking around for someone else  at least for me  was actually detrimental   I felt trapped and eventually resentful of the people who cared about me  If they cared so much  wouldn't they prefer I no longer be suffering  So doing it for myself became the only way to recover  You telling yourself that is make whatever probability she likes you back zero  At least try  if you get rejected you will not get older wondering what if  I was bigger and more shredded than him at my peak a couple years ago  I think girls appreciate a nice body  but they also want a beautiful face  confidence  and vibrant personality to go along with it  1000s of hours in the gym won't magically fix everything  Can you elaborate more   Did they point blank say "not interested in dating but can you do x"   If so  that's fucked  It bothers me a lot  I still put myself out there and try to be social  Sitting in my room all day prevents me from seeing the sadness and couples  but it does nothing to actually fix the problem  I find that over time it starts to bother me slightly less  Maybe I am adapting to the pain  Yeah  going in public sucks     As a guy losing his hair  I look at every guy and get jealous of their hairline   I look at women and think every single one of them is out of my league   And I look at couples and just feel sadness  Why don't you just keep the same name   I live in the US and while I do have a house number  everyone refers to it by the name it was given 100     years ago   FWIW  it's called Millstone  Girls are just as horny as men they just aren't as explicit about it because of biological reasons Same  Lots of abuse in my family and amongst close friends   it never gets any easier to understand  I'm glad you see it was not your fault  and had the savvy to get out before it got even worse  Not that what happened was remotely better  Well you're not the only one  I'm a guy  19   only reason I masturbate is to get rid of the urge  I just try to finish as quickly as possible and I'm done  I think it's a waste of time yet I still do it  17 years old is ridiculously young  Honestly may not even count as FA  Lets say you start liking girls at maybe 14  You have been alone 3 years and its not much  You have not even begun college yet  I would just focus on improving yourself before college  I am 24 and there are others on here that are 30  and still FA  Cold approach won't unless you look like Ryan Gosling   Otherwise you're a creep  Children are bastards  They drain your youth and vigour and keep it for themselves  Mine just turned two and is prodding me in the face with a large toy shark  It's 10 05pm  I just want to watch Sherlock     But it does pass  I hated people who said that to me  But it is true  He used to scream for an hour or so each night solid  When you're living your life on twenty minutes sleep and pasties you've eaten in the car depression can take a very sinister turn     Meds and a doctors appointment will help you to get in a better place  It only has to be short term until you feel better and decide how it's best to support your own mental health and your family  I had a lot of therapy and a mental health team when I was pregnant  At one point I was so panicked I wanted to give the baby to my mother for a year so she could make sure he was okay      If you can try to have some time for you  Go out for coffee or go do something you love  There's more to you than just being a mother      Good luck   I started out getting checked every week  then biweekly  then monthly  and then when my thyroid got wacky the bloodwork increased in frequency again  As for dosage  please take this with a grain of salt because my memory is very poor and I also think I might have been an anomaly   I was SEVERELY overweight while I was on lithium  so I think I was on a very high dose at around 300mgs  but I'm not entirely sure  However  I noticed a change even on my low dose  I think that was 15mgs  and I was at a normal weight then    So if it works for you  you might be able to go in at a very low dose and maybe avoid side effects  Perhaps I was just sensitive to the stuff       Not to sound weird  but have you tried ECT  It's both terrible and not at the same time  It didn't work for me but I've heard it can do wonders for some people and it's NOT like it is in the movies  at all   If your an FA I recommend staying far away from social media  All it does is takes all the things a FA does not have and shoves them in your face  I only use it for the groups that are on there for information and thats it  Exercise  go for a run walk  hike  Sometimes a high intensity workout is a great stress reliever I think the internet really fucked unattractive people   Nowadays there's really no barrier on distance    Having 3 genuine friends is better than none at all  Cut the fake ones out of your life immediately  I'm going to have to tell him because I really don't want him resenting me    Thanks    He is just upset because he did not get as far as you did  He is still likely kissless  That to me is a huge step forward  You are almost borderline FA  You want that to be the rest of your life  How can you enjoy her being attractive if your relationship just consists of that  It has to be addressed  She clearly has issues other than that as well but it seems you'll have to make the first steps into getting through all this   Wish people that showed ''tough love'' bullshit were just banned from this sub    It's the most useless 'advice' to ever give in this sub  even telling someone to shower or to wash his dick is 10 times more helpful than the 'tough love' trash those users spout out  Agreed  if you live an upper middle class lifestyle you need far less than  35M to last you a lifetime  Sell it  invest it conservatively and go to the beach  It helps if you take a moment to breathe  Try some of those youtube anxiety or meditation videos  They help me out  I don't think you did anything wrong per se  it just sounds like you guys weren't clicking  or at least not for her   Doesn't mean that there's anything wrong with you   In fact  what she did to you seems like a pretty shitty thing to do to someone    Keep your head up and keep on being you   You will find someone    A parent that tells their kid that they're disappointed in them is a bad parent    I am a loner    I have about 3 friends Are you the type that gains energy by being with others  or gains energy by being by yourself   If you're the latter  you could be an introvert   I'm similar   when I'm with others  even with very close friends  I get exhausted if I'm with them for extended periods of time   My means of regaining my thoughts and my composure is finding a way to excuse myself to be alone  like going on a walk or running an errand  like getting more food for the get together   Any activity that requires energy requires a breather or two  and socializing isn't any different  I've had disgusted looks  people cross the street to avoid me  I've been taunted and mocked  I definitely don't feel welcome  Smoking shouldn't change the fact that you like the girl  even if you don't smoke yourself  I don't like it myself either  but I try to respect the decision of anyone who does  I think it is that easy but they have to stay married for a few years else the person will lose their visa  You already got advice  dude  Therapy and or see a psychiatrist  Do that first   They go mental for 15min and they are done for the day  Honestly they are amazing house dogs  our boy sleeps ALL DAY if you let him  They do shed a little bit nothing major  Try get a retired one as well    If you want something smaller try a whippet  Just a smaller more affectionate

Never heard of again after original debut in the beginning of last year  Don't smell bad  Small dogs usually have the most energy  You need something lazy    Hey  thanks for your super quick reply  and how thoughtful it was  When I was younger  I tried to get into vore  giantesses  stuff like that  Basically  anything remotely similar to what I was feeling  I looked into it  Vore tends to be a little too furry animal centric for me  GTS stuff wasn't right either  My fantasies were are really quite dark  it was only the most realistic stuff that would scratch my itch  When I was a teen  my go to stuff was specifically horror films that dealt with cannibalism  Green Butcher  Delicatessen  Silence of the Lambs    the opening scene of Red Dragon with the orchestra was played so often I'm surprised I didn't melt the DVD  I practically bust a seam when the Hannibal series was announced    I feel as though I'm not  ashamed     it's nothing I can help  it's gone on for so long  it's integral to me  like any other kink  It was that I just needed to tell someone  It's kinda depressing knowing that no one in the world  not even my boyfriend  who I tell everything  doesn't know the full story behind who I am  I feel that there's a chunk of my personal story I have to keep secret  because no matter how close your relationship is  you can't quite gauge how the other person will react  When people ask me what made me get into criminology  or psychology  or any other innocent question like that  I have to lie     I'm just happy now it's off my chest and at least someone knows   I am sorry for existing  This part really pisses me off   OK  you don't like the way someone looks   There's a lot about our looks that we can control and a lot that we can't   You can't control your basic bone structure and if you end up with the kind of skin condition that needs a doctor it takes so long to clear up etc  etc  etc    But that's no reason to treat someone like their existence is criminal   That's no reason to treat them subhuman for the Crime of Offending Your Eyes   Yet a lot  most   people will   Jesus Christ  fuck normies   EDIT     One time I tried to explain my  I guess self diagnosed  depression to my mom  She said "well  maybe you should go ahead and kill yourself  That would prove my point that you aren't worth it  Go ahead  I always knew you were crazy " She also calls me "fucking retarded" and gaslights me until i freak out and have a panic attack  She likes to pick on me for no reason  and had never in 21 years apologized to me for any of the hurtful things she says  She treats my sister very well  giving her whatever she wants and never criticizing her   If you don't live at home  break off all contact with this woman right now   Yes it will suck in the short run  but in the long run your life will be better   Also  check out the sub  r raisedbynarcissists  I will try that out   From my browsing of this sub  whenever the topic comes up  it seems like the majority of the guys here also do not want  just  sex     I haven't seen a poll or anything  but judging from the comments  some guys say just sex is okay  but seems like most replies say they want something more  I have seen a lot of "I just want someone to cuddle or to have emotional support or to love me" from guys in this sub   This sounds similiar to this http   www independent co uk life style health and families features dale bolinger guilty what is sexual cannibalism 9619716 html  Whether i can or cant relate doesnt matter  its who you are  ive been alone so long my mind drifts to places id rather it not go all the time so i understand  Its good that you control the urge and dont want to hurt anybody though    But i think you really should look into understanding why you have those thoughts and urges  At the very least it might be interesting and at best it could help you understand yourself  It might even help another person as most psychologists i dont think fully understand why this exists and the people who have acted on these fantasies have caused alot of pain to families etc   Maybe you could talk to a shrink online anonymously and tell them all this and tell them you want to understand it they may even help you to further studies in this if you found the right one    Hope you have a good new years  I have a cat     Should have gotten a dog    Thats interesting   I am very fortunate financially and buy whatever the fuck I want   gadgets  cars  e g   It makes me happy for like one day and then im unhappy again the next   I'd trade it away for a normal life    Well they say truth is the strangest fiction Tough love is his field  I thought this was old news  Non invasive treatments are always best  Thank you  She just said we need to have a talk later  Whatever that means  So we'll see It is very difficult to do without looking creepy and manipulative  and it is easily taken out of context  Your best bet is to find people interested in that topic then go with them to public places and chat about it  It's not r foreveralone until someone one ups you on how lonely they are  Something that helps me is listening to podcasts where people express themselves in ways I find interesting  My prime example is the slate culture gabfest  I've borrowed ways of discussing cultural elements  movies  music  articles  from these guys  particularly being able to challenge ideas and opinions in an inclusive  non controversial manner     In short  listen to interesting people talking about things you find interesting  Let it rub off on you and experiment with trying it out   I don't think my Mum takes me seriously  I made a dirty joke and she said "I thought you were supposed to be asexual "  As if that makes me a pure little flower fairy who can't make a filthy joke once in a while   For reference  the head fell off a reindeer ornament and she out it back on  so I made a joke about her giving it 'head'  Not my best  but yeah    Mums are weird  I expressed myself badly   I wasn't upset because mu brother wouldn't go to dinner exactly  I was upset because I tried to use it as an opportunity to start a private conversation about how worried I am for him and got nowhere  I felt helpless and that was what upset me  I don't see what you mean about taling his mental issues personally  of course I'm worried  There is an absolute epidemic of suicide among young men in my country  and there is nothing more terrifying than feeling helpless when someone you love is isolating themselves from the world  My parents can't make him go to counselling  He is already estranged from my fad  if my mam triedto make him he'd block her out too  I just don't know what to do  Lakes Oceans and pools are pretty similar  Non moving or slow moving water  You can float on your back anywhere  People usually don't open their eyes in lakes  and don't do it in the ocean  the salt will burn your eyes  Besides the default subs  have you seen the great lengths they have gone to express themselves   This is just my opinion  but if she made a list about reasons she likes you  I can't imagine it was as all as smooth and successfully clicking like it may have been for you  I LOVE making lists  and I've not felt the need to make a list about someone I was sure of  Yeah they really are haha  I know it's not instant  but it makes it far faster  Also if she has the marriage license she can still use it as if she had a greencard for jobs and keeping her from being deported  Dogs are VERY adaptive creatures  Most will be able to live in an apartment with no problem  But the number one rule here  and it's a really important one  GIVE YOUR DOG ENOUGH EXERCISE   If a dog is taken out often enough to go for walks or playing fetch in an off hours elementary playground away from people is best for playing until the dog has great manners  it will adapt and thrive  Dogs just want exercise mental and physical  and love  With those two things they will flourish   Another note  I don't know where you live  but if you find a website along the lines of http   olddoghaven org but based in your area  they will adopt out senior dogs AND pay the vet bills  Dogs are the best partners life has to offer  Good luck   Don't forget r atheism  I'm actually unsure if I do it myself but I know in the past I've had friends who  when they're in a larger group  would talk to me in a completely different tone than they normally would if we were alone together  It makes you feel like you're not on the same level as the other people in the group or that you don't belong as well  With dogs just be prepared to give it a proper amount of exercise every day  Larger breeds tend to get antsy and tear up furniture or other things if they aren't walked enough  If you think you might not be able to give a dog the TLC it needs consider a Cat  Much less high maintenance   And cat's are not dumb as you said in another comment  They just don't give a single fuck about your verbal commands but they can be the most chill and loving animals on the planet   Yes  your depressed  Getting friends helps a lot  Learn how to talk to people  Why don't you want to talk to people  Try to figure that question out  Check out  r nofap   r stopgaming   Looks and confidence I'd say  Tried working on both this past year but I still think it got me nowhere  I don't even know why I bother with self improvement anymore  Do some research on foods that enhance memory     Go to the doctor and get your iron and b12 levels tested    You may want to ask for a test to see if you are gluten intolerant as well  because memory and brain function can be affected by a gluten intolerance without ever giving you an upset stomach  Just read in general     I've been told I can be eloquent and come off as intelligent  and I really have literature to thank for that  I love reading  and I always have  It really does help you in that it expands your vocabulary  introduces different perspectives  worldviews  and styles themes   Maybe read more news as well   I recently discovered my local paper has an online PDF of its newspaper everyday  I've been keeping up with it daily  and it really is crazy how much you learn  and retain  from doing that  It helps to keep you in the know  so that you can contribute more better in conversations about current events    Maybe try your hand at writing as well   Writing a lot can be good practice in getting your thoughts organized and voiced the way you want them    How do you know that  That hurts Did you try to have sex with her and she refused  I know you said you haven't done it in a month  but did you try and she refused   And what about those pains  Are you circumcised  Otherwise I really don't see how you penis could become sore   When I used to jerk off frequently  a few times a week  I had no problems using my saliva only    Anyways  why don't you try to actually have some sex with her   Next time you could do this  "I will jerk off only if you start taking your clothes off"  Then in the middle of the job you could stop doing it and ask her to do it  then continue talking to her and get her to have sex with you  Maybe you could get a BJ as well   I don't really know how you guys feel tho'  I just hope I helped  Maybe I got you some ideas   As someone who was focused on doing particularly well in high school   I can say the mentality of doing well in hs paid off because getting to college and "switching on" wasn't a problem    Put in about the same dedication and I did fine  Had friends that took a year or 2 to adjust and depending on career aspirations that could be bad I've been there  except for having a kid   and frankly one of the reasons I don't have kids is because I was terrified that what you described would happen to me  What has happened to me is I get worse and worse until something makes me cry and I can't stop crying  That's what usually gets me back to the doctor  It's okay  You need help  and you're getting it  Getting to that moment must be a big relief   I have major depression  and my brother is bipolar  I know it took my brother a while to find the right drug combination that didn't make him feel like a zombie    Hang in there    Your psychiatrist will work with you to find the right meds  Be sure to communicate with him or her    Bipolar is different from major depression  but if you think deep breathing might help   here's a great website  http   www xhalr com   that has a visual representation for breathing   Also   here's a nifty self care list  https   www reddit com r TwoXADHD comments 3bg0go selfcare pdf pretty great list to keep handy   to remind you what to do  The link to the list is within this post   Some people think that having mental illness and going to a psychologist or psychiatrist makes a person weak    That's not true    The strong people realize when they need help  and then get that help   Good luck  OP  I hope things work out for you  I don't really have anything to say since you're only venting but I would prepare if I ware you for the age 20 30 since legit nearly everyone has a relationship which leads to difficulties making friends and list goes on  Of course  I deleted my FB page in 2015  I have a Snapchat account just so I can receive pics from a few friends  Vorarephilia sums me up perfectly  I'm just as disgusted by murder and torture as most other people  I don't want to kill  and I don't want people to think that's part of my fetish and that I'm specifically holding back   that's one of the main reasons I only want to talk anonymously     I feel as though I can trace where my fantasies evolved  I've tried to give as much of a potted history as I could in my OP  in my opinion  it was a perfect storm consisting of eating disorders  late sexual development  and a desire to have power over others who upset me     I've thought about it a lot in the years  My interest in true crime and psychology specifically stems from a desire to try and work out what was going on in my head  I wouldn't be adverse to talking to a shrink about it if it helps other people understand  I went on a long trip with my friends and at first it was great  I was having a good time and everything was going swimmingly  Then all of a sudden I just got bored and a flip switched and it was like all the energy I had was drained very quickly  When I'm in this state I literally don't even want to speak and I just want to sit somewhere and meditate  I do this often anyway   Pugs are low energy dogs  We have 4 dogs   jack russell terrier  a pug and 2 jugs  a cross of both breeds  The JRT is rocket fuel on caffeine  the jugs are mellow enough  and the pug has to be dragged outside to have a walk  Barking is also at a lower pitch with the pug   Interesting  but good food and shallow pleasures are the only things that carry me along  I've always thought I'm on some part of the spectrum  What if that's the reason we're so good at staying committed to a gym routine   I wish I could say something that could actually help with most of the stuff you're going through  I will say being too disabled to function isn't wasting your life   I recommend doing a little bit each day  just enough that you're proud of yourself   I also advise working on understanding your gender identity  If you are trans then it's best to transition sooner rather than later  It's also a good place to start working on getting your life closer to where you want it Well  weren't pigeons are used to deliver messages  Thx  I'll try   Kids are indeed bastards  but they are our bastards  Thank you for your support I love hearing from other mothers who have similar experiences  It is refreshing when the negativity of parenting and mental illness can be shared just as openly as the positives and progresses   This is adorable  i'm rooting for you guys  I want to tell my family that women are too shallow  but instead i tell them that im way too busy for women there is a difference actually  An SJW will stop at nothing to protect the oppressed  noirs  poor blancos  nonviolent druggers  those unable to find work   A numbnuts is just a numbnuts  Thank you so much  I really need to hear these things more often   Thank you for the cat referral  That made me laugh  Haven't properly been out in public for about a year  but I do remember it being depressing  Would the saying "Nothing Ventured  Nothing Gained" work in this situation  The harder your journey gets  the sweeter the reward     I don't know if you would like this  but you might somehow be able to convince the school to let you repeat the semester during summer  I feel there is some way to do this like providing proof you were terminally ill  and needed to focus more on survival  God damn I feel exactly the same  Time is speeding up   I have a diploma  I have a decent job and I make enough money at the moment to be happy   but I've been thinking about going to university  purely for the social side  I mean I guess the new skills would be nice  but I feel like I've majorly missed out on the social side   My 'friends' definitely make me feel like I've missed out  they know that I'm a virgin and say stuff like 'oh you would have gotten some poon if you went to uni' or 'maybe you'd have friends if you went to uni'     Talk to him in person privately  Tell him how you feel about the way he's being treated  The fact that someone is even noticing caring will help him majorly  Tell him he needs to get help in the form of a school counselor or anything  Go to that counseling person to make sure he gets help  I wish I could apply a million down votes to this post  Like a karmic nuclear bomb  I just saw your pic in veganfitness as well  You did awesome progress  Would you mind telling us what programme or routine you used   Her move was bitchy  but I don't think your year should be too awful   just keep lifting  your progress is really amazing  I'm actively lifting for like a year  but didn't really make progress  I definitely need to change something  We are leaning towards pugs because A  We both like that breed just in general and B  We get a resounding good for apartment living  The plan is to go to our local pound or humane society and adopt  I didnt come out of my room for that very reason  I've been in my room for the most part since Christmas Eve   Ahh thank you so much   This made my night    yeah but people kept eating them I am so incredibly sorry  I've lost a lot of friends to heroin and meth  If you want to talk about it  please feel free to PM me  I'm here for you  I already gave them proof  and I am retaking the classes  The problem is I want to switch majors and schools  and having to wait an extra semester  pay an extra semester  is really something I don't want to do  Also  hugs  Well first you need to find one  Super random tip   search for something on wikipedia and while skimming the text click on any related topic that seems least boring  Continue until you find a topic that is indeed not boring to read about     Does anyone feel the same way   Nope  Life sucks but a shitty life is better than no life at all  People dying every day from terrible diseases  mauled by hippos  starving to death etc At least we have comfortable lives  decent food  video games  whatever  Let's sop it up while we can   Also  maybe we should get a dog  I say that every year It's vermin not a friggin' puppy  Masturbate before she comes over so that you last longer  And make sure your hygiene is good  Don't be awkward while watching the movie  ex  Folding your hands in your lap while sitting side by side with her  if she shows some signs of affection then a little while through the movie maybe try putting your arm around her     All I want out of this life is someone to give all the love I have to          I refuse to settle for just anyone       DOES NOT COMPUTE What is it and how much will you be making  We both know that's a load of shit because I'm looking right at it  Last night at a rave a couple of people  separately  walked up to me to say something  One of them a girl who asked for a lighter  I sensed she wanted to converse  said a few things  I replied to them and asked a thing or two back  Then I didn't know what to say due to mild anxiety nor could I muster the social energy and interest to keep asking her things  even though she looked pretty  When she said something our heads were close to each other and that felt nice  For a moment I wanted a kiss and nothing more but wouldn't know how  When she wanted to leave she said bye and I considered asking for a goodbye kiss but that is probably not considered cool to do as a male   Meeting girls at stuff like this is not for me  I am not sufficiently interested in strangers  only co workers and friends  so I keep to myself or the people I'm with and just dance at parties or concerts  And something like this where a girl says something to me happens maybe once a year and I can't be arsed to be interested in a random stranger  The fact that relationship culture involves this activity to a large extent annoys me  I don't want to find a potential gf in a stranger  much less at loud parties    Think about what you want to say  while you're saying whatever it is you're talking about  You'll probably ramble for a bit but it's OK as long as you get across  And keep your voice clear    Edit  I feel like that too  I don't want to be as quiet but I don't want to say something I don't mean  necessarily  Assuming your assessment is correct it sounds like the school isn't giving you the education you should be getting   If you are straight A's then I would say to change to the public school where you might be challenged by what could be better teachers   I had excellent teachers in public school  most of whom pushed and pushed for us to do better and get the most out of our education   I wish I had appreciated it at the time    On the other hand at your age I was shy enough that I'd have rather died than change schools   In my opinion the education is the most important thing  and the variety of experience you get at your age   The more things you do and try and fail succeed at the more options you'll see for yourself later in life in careers places to live hobbies    Good luck  champ   Good for you for being mature enough to think about the education you're getting   I was far too dumb and immature to care about it at your age   Look man  I am an 18 year old boy and I am a virgin as well   Do you know this girl for a long time and she really expects to watch a movie tomorrow or not   If not  from what I heard from my friends  most of the times they barely even watch the beginning of the movie   The fact that you consider yourself "average looking" and that you talked this girl into coming over at your place  makes me think that you really underestimate yourself  It's something that we  the virgins  do pretty often   What I would do if I was you is this  after the movies starts  start kissing her and see how she reacts  If she is okay  screw the movie and keep going  After you undress and so on  pull out the condoms and be like "look  I have something to tell you  I got the V card in my wallet  I feel like I am ready to give it to you  so I want this to be something special"   Then fuck her brains out    In Romania there is a saying  "Hit her like the deaf man hits the church's bell"   BUT   Are you sure you wanna lose your virginity to this girl  After I turned 18  in June  2016  my cousin arranged a 2 v 2 sort of date with two girls  I could have had sex with any of them  but I did not really like them  so I said pass  So I decided to wait for my special pumpkin  D   If you still wanna bang  make sure you are clean and open the damn' window before the girl arrives    To be honest  I never thought I would make a fool of myself if I would tell a girl that I am a virgin  Who knows  maybe your girl will even enjoy fucking a newbie   Don't forget to tell us how it went   Hit her like the deaf man hits the church's bell   Police  starting salary is 23 000  will rise with increments until I reach 46000 after 19 years  With allowances i'll realistically be getting an extra 7 000 a year on top of the base salary  The other job is starting salary 24 000 with no increments although it gives me the freedom to study part time too     i'm aware that I might be crazy for walking away from a career with a very good guaranteed pension  I'm just not sure it's something I want to commit 30 years of my life to  Any advice is really appreciated   You have a guaranteed job and pension     I have an interview for another job this week in an industry that i'm very interested in working in  however  the benefits and money aren't nearly as good  From what I could determine  I would certainly opt on the side of security   If the salary and benefits were superior for this other opportunity  I would see some point in this   It's not as if you're going to be entirely prevented from pursuing the domain of interest at some point in the near  or distant  future once you've secured this guaranteed job   It just may never generate your  primary  source of income   Best of luck  and I hope that this assists in some manner   refused to take meds because I didn't want to be a zombie    I just want to touch on this  I'm on meds for my own mental health issues  I know being tied to a pill is scary and I resisted it for the longest time myself   My biggest piece of advice is to be critical of how they make you feel  Don't be afraid to bug your doctor  Once you decide you don't like a drug for whatever reason  call the doctor and tell him her you want something different   I changed meds four times before I found one I could live with  It wasn't easy  but it was worth it  It's not a magical cure  but it levels me out enough that I can manage the rest   You can do this  The hardest part is often just telling someone you need help and you did that on your own   We're all rooting for you     Boo fucking hoo Thanks for reply it's much appreciated  Although I should have specified that it's police work so other options pretty much go off the table once i'm in   It's going to be OK   You're going to be OK  I understand EVERY feeling that you wrote about  I'm a stay at home mom to 3 girls   I have some serious health problems   my husband just doesn't seem to notice   care   whatever    Savor the good days  and the bad ones will bring you to your knees and push the envelope  You are human  life isn't perfect and sometimes shit is fucked up    You are a power house  a succulent wild woman  and I know that this may sound silly  but take the time to get dressed   put make up on  on the rough days pick the most obnoxious  loud  vibrant red lipstick and rock it    Realize that there's many people out here who understand  struggling  and going through shit    Kudos to you for realizing that you need help   something isn't right    Have your thyroid checked   Mine was always on the low end of normal  10 years later  I'm raising my kids   down in the depths of hell  going on year 3  round 4 of battling cancer  No one seems to notice or give a fuck    My mom took her life this past August  and as her child   I'm devastated     as a person   I understand that she just couldn't anymore    Please   if you feel like you want to talk   PM me    Remember   You are a succulent wild woman    Big hugs and always remember   you don't have to fake the smile   Go to the park  exercise  spend time with your family    And video games  everyone on the internet isn't haven't a great of time as you think they are   First things first  I'm so sorry for your loss  My dad is my best    well  I'm going to be truthful and say my only friend and I don't know if I would be able to follow the advice that I'm going to give you now    Okay  the first thing you have to do is take a minute  Take five or ten or thirty minutes actually  That may seem like a short amount of time  but you're going to get more minutes later  You can do whatever you want in that time  cry  pray  curse God   it's up to you    When you've done that  I'm sorry but you're going to have to look out for your younger siblings  Sit with them  hold them  make sure that they know that you're there for them  If they need to cry tell them that that's alright  it's natural  and if you need to cry with them then that's perfectly fine too  It's the same thing if your mother or anyone else in your family needs it because  while you've got to look after everyone  you've got to be looked after too  And that's what families are for  looking out for one another   But don't neglect alone time if you need it and make sure to respect other people's alone time if they ask for it  Likewise  if someone isn't obviously sad don't throw judgement  People grieve in their own ways  And if you need to speak to your father  don't feel ashamed  There's a reason that people pray  even if they don't believe in a god    Don't neglect yourself  think about the good times with your dad  and remember that you are not alone   Have you ever considered trying a sport  When I was your age I would release that urge by going to the gym or jogging   What do you think about that    Everybody  and I mean EVERYBODY has some kind of fantasy down there that they never want coming to be  I have one  my GF has one  my BFF has one  it's always there  The best option is to try and find something to distract you  Something that you like more  that doesn't depress you  Just try anything new that pops into your head  Eventually you'll find something that blows your mind  without depressing you  Remember you are the CEO  You have the ability to empower change that you need  For  1  change up board meetings  identify why they are a chore and see if there sia nything you can do  2 invite a friend  Your friends would probably love a trip with you  3 you should have far more time available then this  6 what employees are you firing  You should have managers that you manage who do that  This is an absolute true though  it sucks but sometimes it has to be done  For  8  I have a case study from a human relations book I want you to read  I'll PM it to you  She asks specifically to watch me  Sometimes she's across the room when she asks and tells me to stay where I am  She  pulled away the other night when I tried to hold her in bed   The last time I initiated oral sex with her she literally started talking to my penis  Like how people talk to their dog  It was a huge turn off  Didn't even finish and I ended up going to take a shower   I'm cut to answer your question  Have you ever had an hour  masturbation session days in a row  Feels like I'm literally punching myself in the nuts by the end of it   She's disinterested in normal forms of sex  She needs therapy I'm sure  I'm just afraid how she's going to react when I bring it up  look uhh at least you got a date  I think she was just wierd  She matched you  she knew that tinder is not for fucking "friends"  she then went on a date with you  said yes to a second date   She knew you did not want to be "just friends" in my opinion from the beginning  she just    idk  got cold feet for whatever reason  You look great though  saw the pic  so shouldn't take you long to get the fuck out of this place forever   Thanks for the reply  I wasn't up for asking this question out loud  in person with someone else  If they sell your DNA to insurance companies  good luck getting any insurance if they find out you have a disease that will show in several years  Make sure you read the fine print  Do they own your DNA  Can they sell it  You think you would be happier doing the other job  I would say if the other job fits you lifestyle and makes more money and you have a real deep feeling that you would get it  then go for the other job  If you have better skill sets  becoming a cop will be a dead end  I know I sure as hell wouldn't want to do 30 years as a cop  What I mean is that I want to give my love to someone but I'm not going to just settle for some random John who will waste it   This  or maybe she is similar to an ex gf of mine who has severe commitment issues   She also made lists and had an extremely hard time "settling" on one person   Like if I wasn't the exact perfect match she couldn't stand the thought of not keeping her options open   She claimed to love me  but always had one foot out the door   She also has extreme self esteem issues and also had tendencies to self sabotage because when she did manage to convince herself I was right for her  she then fixated on her not deserving to be loved and put up walls   I bring this up because different people have multitudes of "issues" or baggage and this could all stem from some strange hangup if her own that she needs to deal with    And for her to drag you on a ten hour drive to spend new year's with her family  and then dismiss you so coldly suggests to me that there is more to her than meets the eye     So with the little information that I have  I say that it sounds more like either she has some shit to sort out  or there just wasn't a spark for her   But again  to send you packing on a ten hour drive home on New Years Eve is not something that I think level headed  caring people do unless there was some bigger issue at hand   Sorry this happened to you OP   Dating can be rough   You will find someone good  I am not a professional swimmer but I think everyone will agree when I say that it's WAY easier to swim in an ocean rather than swimming in a pool   Salty water tends to keep you up  I am not saying it's easier to get from point A to point B in the middle of the ocean  But it's easier to float  Every time I go to the sea I could float on my back all day long  but in a pool I get tired very fast    You should really go to some beach and try swimming in the sea  If you can stay afloat in a pool  I guarantee you can do it in a sea as well and it will seem easier  A failure of a mother wouldn't have the strength that you do     Although I should have specified that it's police work so other options pretty much go off the table once i'm in   Then  to warn you  I'm definitely a biased party here  two family members were in law enforcement    That being stated  I know of at least several cases where the security of the job provided them with the opportunities to expand into other industries  it obviously just took some years of investing their time  I'm pretty sure the majority of us here would never act this way if you were to talk to us in real life  But inward  the people here are very depressed about themselves because they lack the social validation that most normal people have  And no matter how hard they try  they cannot change it   one summer puberty happened to her and she got incredibly attractive and she refused to speak to me again  I tried  but she always shut me down so she could hang out with attractive people   For me  that's the most depressing item on your list   WTF is wrong with people  Kick his ass out  Actions have consequences  He seems to find satisfaction outside of you some I'm sure he'll find some place to stay but he's not worth your time Pictures  I seriously don't think anyone can be "ugly"   Gif version  https   www reddit com r ForeverAlone comments 5epqbv nice guys kappa  ref share ref source link  Get a calendar and put down your due dates  Check it every day and assure you have enough time to meet deadlines  I think it's more than just socialization   I mean  each and every person is the result of thousands of generations of people who achieved some degree of romantic sexual success   How can that not have an impact on one's genes    If you're in america there is no "proper vest tags paperwork" There is no legally recognized or required paperwork  vest  id  tag  certification or registration  For flying the laws are different but i'm just putting that out there to inform everyone else  I am so sorry that you had to experience that  I can't claim in the slightest that I understand  and I know coming from a stranger this  won't mean much  but I wish you the best in healing from this  Please take all the time you need to care for yourself  I didn't want to post this  but I probably need to    He's manipulating you  it's a guaranteed to get a blow job  Have a serious word with him  and tell him you know why he lied about it   Well  everyone ghosts on Tinder  It's easy to ignore someone than to hurt their feelings apparently  That sounds stupid but it's how people think sadly   FTFY What happens if you don't go back  No tldr and just a long ass story yet you're seeking advice  Lmao  You're not from around here are you  Holy shit you're legit attractive Rejection is rejection  It blows  Nothing much we can say will help    However  I am certain there isn't anything wrong with you  Any quality that this person didnt like about you might be the thing that makes the "right" one want to be with you  A relationship takes 2 people  You may have been all in but she wasn't  Nothing you could have done would have change that    All you can do is put on some Sinatra  pour 4 fingers of scotch or bourbon and drown it out till these feelings pass    There will be others  One you find the right one all of the others will feel so insignificant   If she may not known she was being filmed I would definitely bring it up with her   That's my plan for the next little while  if I could lose a solid 30 40lbs  I'll be good to go  As far as cold approaches go I'm going to just join some clubs and meet people through other people  cold approaches are not fun to me anymore  Thanks for the help my man  I have this problem too so it's very possible he's just being honest   It's depressing but sometimes friendships do just fizzle out as people change  This reminds of one of my similar situations where I talked to a person regularly but then conversation started dying out  we did have a few fallings out but I just moved on  as hard as it was  Trust me  you'll find a new friend  you just need patience and an open mind  Hello twin  I have had the exact same problem as you  addiction to video games  Games like Skyrim just take me away and I never can put it away  The best way to conquer this is by doing one thing  give your controller to your parents  This will help you out a lot  I dont have many friends and usually resorted to video games for entertainment  or having anything to do in general  My grades went down  and made me very lazy   So I decide to give my parents my controller during the weekdays  They hide it from me until the weekend comes  but of course I have to finish my homework before I get the controller  I don't recommend completely removing video games from your life because it won't help  what will help is limiting it  and if you enjoy it so much you will feel motivated to do your work because when you do it you will be able to play  Man  I hear you  I have nothing super constructive or helpful or encouraging to tell you except that you are not alone    Though not on the same level  I'm struggling too  My depression and anxiety has been the worst it has ever been for the past couple months and it's awful  Even though I have been in therapy consistently for over a year  it's so goddamned rough  Depression and anxiety are   awful  it feels impossible to escape the demons when they are in your own head    I'm so sorry this is happening to you  but you are incredibly strong for taking your health into your own hands and taking this first step for yourself  I know a smidgen of how you must feel  and my heart goes out to you  I wish I had something better to say  but I know what helps me most when my mind goes to dark and scary places is simply knowing I'm not alone  You are not alone   maybe he is lonely and wants to spend time with you or in crowds  He may be forming an unhealthy attachment to you  I would talk to him about it and suggest therapy if he is struggling If it's any consolation  my dad threw me out of the house because he caught my mom cheating on him  I lived out of my car for a month before one of my friends found out and let me crash on his couch  It was shitty  I had only been sober for less than a year  I'm a cocaine addict  but pot friendly  and I couldn't tell my parents that  I had lost my scholarship to a community college  really  who does that  and was the lowest I've ever been  I'm telling you  it gets better  I've come such a long way since then by recognizing that it was a low point and I was unhappy  You'll get through this  and you've got a much better chance than I did   okay you say your mental problems are partly due to your debt  As advice i would give you to set realistic goals  with the 668 dollars you have left you will still have to pay the interest on your debt  food and clothing for as far as i can see  i think a reasonable goal could be to try to keep 200 in paying of rent every month   You will have to see how this goes  is it is really easy you might wanna make it a bit higher so you are faster out of debt  if it is to hard you can adjust it down but this number must always be positive     I don't know the interest on your credit card  but i assumed you have an extremely high interest on it  probably around 16 percent or something  i calculated with 20  that you would be paying 300 dollars per month in interest  Which is insanely much  Try to pay these off  Even if this means you have to lend from a family member or something    Do not take payday loans  these are even worse     Some things you might want to figure out  is it possible to get rid of the car  623 a month is a lot  Do you need it or can you handle with public transportation  Also the phonebill is extremely high  you might find a way to cut that back a little   With your mental state it might not be wise to do an extra job  but you could still consider doing one extra just to get out of this debt    I don't know about the help that there is provided in canada for students  but I don't think it is a good idea to go spend money on education when you are so far in debts  However it depends a bit on how the educational system is in canada   What you still can do  is to just start writing and reading more  You have an internet connection so you can read till infinity  You can also go to a libary and lend some books  just depending on taste  If you want to do something in journalism  than you should start it now as a hobby while you try to get out of this debt   I hoped i helped with all your questions  if you have any questions remaining i would love to hear about them  Make sure your penis smells good  your entire body smells good  you shave    If you dont want to make a fool out of yourself just try and talk about anything that interests her  If she leads you on eventually start being more flirty  If you end up kissing her  you'll be able to tell if she wants it or not  Definitely not a myth  My last 6 encounters have been like this  Meet at a party  alcohol  flirting  let's go back to "your" or "my" place  3 of them I saw a few more times  the others  just 1 night stands  The ages of these woman were 27  28  30  40  37  23  Haven't actually done any   Ha  in my head I picture you at your neighbors' and you check your phone and see that comment and you suddenly start backing away from people nervously   Maybe next year you should properly host a party with maybe 5 close friends  then maybe it won't be as awkward as this years  Aw  well that is a reflection on them and not you   Unfortunately  some people are just terrible people   Since I'm ugly  I understand getting ridiculed by random strangers   I just tell them off and ignore them   Don't let assholes make you feel like you have to hide away and don't deserve to enjoy life   You do deserve it  not matter what some insecure losers say   I don't know if you're a girl or guy   But  if you are a guy  sometimes girls will cross the street to avoid guys because some girls are taught that's a safety precaution   Maybe you could try going out with some friends who could help stick up for you and potentially discourage people from harassing you   Either way  those people don't have a right to treat you that way or hinder your ability to go outside  I mean  why are we soziolized that way  Because finding a mating partner is our biological value for society  We should feel bad for beeing alone so we get a partner and do our biological duty  Ofcause not everyone can succeed  Such "motivaton" pics upset me because they don't help me  they just seem ignorant  She petified you  I still make tons of mistakes in my job and I just deliver papers  I also suck at FPS games as well but I choose to do a different hobby that not many people do and that's playing the bass  its more impressive since not many people do it that I know of   I'm going to pipe in my "me too " Like you  it's just as if a switch gets flipped  Nothing anyone says causes it  it just comes out of no where  and that's it  the fun time is over  There is nothing that causes it  I can step away to use the rest room  enjoying myself  and walk out of the rest room wanting to leave  so I know it's not anything that anyone present has said   I am so bad  I have on  many  occasions just left  without saying a word to anyone  And by many  I mean most times I go out with people  I'll take note if anyone's looking at me  and if no one is  I'll just walk away and go home  Some years ago  I injured my hand  The night it happened  I was in a lot of pain  but I iced it  and did my best to ignore it  Because I couldn't see any bruising  I thought it was just a strain  I suffered with a painful and very swollen hand for nearly a week  and when the swelling finally decreased I saw the truth  my hand was purple and green and crooked  I'd broken the darn thing  So I went to the doctor  Got some x rays  They put me in a cast  I wore it for seven weeks  And then my hand was better    My hand had been hurt  I wanted to be strong  but I couldn't fix it by myself  There was no shame in my seeing a doctor  There was no shame in my needing to wear a cast  That's what casts are for  There was no shame in my needing help   Please understand  it is the same for you  There is no shame in your needing help   We don't tell people with broken bones to "tough it out"  and broken bones are  simple  compared to what goes on in our minds  Yet for some reason society tells us that if we are unable to fix complicated mental health problems alone and in silence then we are weak   This isn't true   Sometimes we need help  and that's fine  Sometimes we need to wear a cast  Please  go find the cast that will help you become healthy again    Listen   You're not a failure    You are human    You are brave    You are strong   Part of your strength is in realizing that you need help  and in taking steps toward securing it  So many people never make it this far  You are strong   Please know that this stranger is thinking of you  When doing stuff with currents DO NOT GET COCKY  Other than that yeah  also oceans and rivers are also made from H2O    So my Flat contract says I can't stay there unless I'm registered with the uni  and while I am while on leave I'm not if I don't go back  obviously   Living with my parents again may not be an option  I don't think they'll take me in and mental health services in my home area are virtually nonexistent   Also I'd be left with only the money in my pocket because obviously Student Finance isn't a thing if you're not a student   So the plan is to find a job  enough to get a place in the city where I study  because literally all my friends and connections are there and support is actually available    Of course the likelihood of that working seems like it's 0  in which case I have no idea  You are so articulate  Did you ever consider being more dominant  To be honest  I am not that experienced when it comes to girls  18 year old virgin  but I answered to you because I thought you could use the advice of someone who sees your problem from "the outside"    You said you are the only one working  Since your friends said she is "out of your league"  do you think you are like a "sugar daddy"  Or you don't make that much money    From what I know  IF she has a problem then there has to be something that caused the problem in question   What did she say when you asked her "why do you wanna keep watching me masturbating "   Do you communicate enough  I mean  she seems to be kinda selfish  Did you ever tell her that you want to have sex and that you got tired of masturbating  Did you tell her that you have needs too and that she is being selfish   Just try to talk more    And to answer your question  when I was 14 16  can't remember precisely  I remember I had a few masturbating streaks which were way longer than yours and I don't recall any pains  And from what I have read so far all over the internet  I don't see any good reason to circumcise my kid  I don't want to derail this topic  but I hope you will at least think twice before doing that to your children as well     How's that your fault  You started a conversation normally and you didn't get a response  it might be that she doesn't go on facebook  much or that she's busy with something   Call your Drs office  don't be embarrassed  r sex  New throwaway maybe   Also  i think they have a faq kinda thing    Wow  I never expected this to be as big of a post as it has gotten  I really appreciate all of the kind words of encouragement and support from everyone it may not feel like it makes a difference but it really makes me feel like I have a wonderful internet family there for me  I have been trying to reply to everyone who commented and I don't want to leave anyone out because all these comments have made me feel so loved and meaningful and you all deserve a sincere thank you    For those of you who are currently experiencing similar struggles and similar inadequacies or who are just in need of some love please feel free to message me  we are in this together and no one should feel alone in this  Mental illness sucks and it is incredibly hard to admit you may need help or that you can't do it all on your own  If you are considering suicide PLEASE call the suicide hotline in your area or call 911 visit the local ER for help  There is no shame in admitting you are struggling or feel alone in your pain because  as I've found today  we are not alone in our experiences  You are loved and you matter to this stranger    I want you all to know that I love each of you and I thank you all so very much for your kindness  Thank you so much for caring  seriously  thank you all so much   great advice from Jewst  Also  if you're ever in the presence of people who are bullying him  you can publicly stick up for the kid  If you have have social capital  ie if people tend to follow what you do  or listen to what you have to say  then this sort of thing can be impactful  Something as simple as "Hey  that's not funny" could shut a person right up    It's awesome that you want to do something to help  School bullying can be catastrophic if the victim feels alone  You're good  thank you  Just stop doing stuff that isnt productive while you should be  Fap THEN shower  The other order may leave you sweaty and smelling like jizz   I have 3 friends but it doesn't mean I see them all  all the time   To admit and then write this took courage  and I applaud you for that   It makes me think you must be a great mother to be able to do it   Parenting is tough and it sounds to me like you are on the right track  even if it's bumpy as hell right now   Good luck  and get well  Thank you for the advice I'm not looking forward to finding one that works for me  it's  going to be a hard time consuming effort to find myself again but I think it will be worth it in the end  Thank you for caring  I feel sorry for you and your penis     And your dogs     I agree  I love how even with anonymity  most people here choose to be nice  Check out  r casualconversation sometime  I've had to deal with this all through high school and am having to continue it through my senior year of college    I'm sorry for all the others that have to go through this  It's a hard thing that  those friends who do this to us  never understand  I don't have any friends  I'm sorry you've had to go through this stuff too  you're right people can be really horrible and when it does happen it just kind of leaves an imprint in your psyche  Thanks for the advice man  What kind of interest also   I think this is relevant as i  m  have a  f riend i banter a lot with  Its frustrating to be mistaken for a couple when you dont have a romantic sexual interest  Some positive data about alternative treatment would be just wonderful    a lot of what is available as herbal treatments is very likely more toxic  less effective but available without a prescription and muuuch cheaper   I bought some Valerian root the other night  I can't afford to go back to a psychiatrist and I am running out of my meds    I personally would greatly benefit from an over the counter antidepressant and anxiety medication  even if they are not terribly effective   Got an idea   Why don't you tell her that you found a porn video of some other friend of your  "Andrea"  and you think that "Andrea" may not know   Ask Amie what she thinks about it and if she thinks it would be good to tell Andrea   Hope you know what I mean   Trust me having a SO is super overrated  Don't value yourself because you don't have a partner  that is so disrespectful to yourself  You have to be happy with yourself before you expect others to be happy with you  People who are alone think that it's depression   relationship   happiness  Where in reality it's depression   self happiness   confidence  And from there you can get into a relationship but you see little value in them    Loneliness is solved by being happy with yourself  not having more people around you   It definitely is  There's no middle ground for me  I either overdo something or don't do it at all   You really should look at your financial situation first  Can you afford to travel where you want  Then you should think what you might do after travelling  If you really want to change professions then that's more learning and that learning could be done sooner instead of travelling  I wouldn't say it's a stupid idea by any means but perhaps getting a god career in a job you enjoy then after settling down you could pack your bags and travel   Just an idea and good luck in whatever you choose    They are low energy  but obsessively devoted    to a point of annoyance  My son got the pug but she shadows me everywhere  licks me to annoyance and will perch on my head when I am sleeping  Look into the pug crosses too  The outbreeding seems to calm their neurotic nature  And they get their feeling hurt deeply and quickly  my sons dog gave me the stink eye for a week when I got mad when she chewed my slippers  edit  Be prepared for a bit of a diva  they don't like long walks but are demanding of attention      read guilt trip   Well  here's to 2017 and the possibilities of something more than just sex coming our way  Cheers     Spot on my man  spot on  In all honesty  this is great advice if you're looking for study buddies or platonic friends    nbsp   But as for a potential girlfriend boyfriend  Sure  it'll probably work    if you're good looking  It's only creepy if you're ugly  Hang in there OP  Kids are great  they're amazing and raising a child is the greatest thing in the world  but goddamn parenting sucks  It's awful  Sometimes we all want to jump in the car and give the family a big fuck you so we can take a shit in peace  You're not alone in feeling how you do  far from it  Stay strong  get help  be open about how you feel  and don't feel bad about it  You're a great mother and wife if you weren't  you'd have nope'd out long ago  Don't feel alone and don't despair  Get help if you feel you need it  but don't feel bad or ashamed  It's a tough road  but the good parent stays on the road and keeps driving  Stay strong  a lot of internet strangers want you to succeed and feel better  To be fair this is definitely not representative of all marriage    Anecdotal evidence can be given for anything  my parents have been happily married and there isn't anything like the above going on in their relationship Thank you  I am so sorry for your loss  I can't imagine what you must be feeling  I hope to find the strength and courage to keep going even when I feel like I can't  It is always going to be a struggle but I really am happy I've made this choice   Why not get a gf by meeting someone through a friend  Most relationships are formed through mutual friends  Thank you so much  I'm doing the very best I can for him  Everyone is beautiful in their own way Maybe she's a cum freak and is attracted to it   i still want to be friends  I want to eat all the christmas leftovers in the fridge  but it isn't healthy   Good Luck  but I recommend cutting contact  for now at least  May I ask what country you are in  and if there is decent access to mental health professionals there     He is already estranged from my fad  if my mam triedto make him he'd block her out too   Since he is living in their home  they hold all the power   If he doesn't work to work with them  they can ask him to leave  It may be to much to handle for them  And thus its easier to stop    Im sorry to hear it happend to you   Thank you so much  You are loved and I hope we both grow together and learn to deal with this the best way we can   That's an effect of the drug too though  it's just as fake as her happiness  Her serotonin was depleted  which is why she felt like crap    You are a hero  What's crazy about being a hero is that it is hard and puts you in fucked up situations  You were the one to stand up for your niece   You made a mistake with Amy  One that is very very common and understandable   You can make it thru this   I know this is sort of an older post  but I just joined the sub and saw it  All the stuff I've seen about mushrooms and anxiety focus on people with anxiety about a specific life problem such as cancer  Has anyone had experience with it when you just have a mental illness that's biological chemical whatever in nature and not caused by anything other than your brain makeup  New Years and Valentine's Day are just like any other day for me  I don't feel sadder  Just the regular amount of sad  Why not better booze for NYE  I attended a family wedding a few months ago  and one of my relatives told my dad that he's going to be a father in law soon  It was inevitable that said relative asked my dad about how I was doing in terms of dating finding a girlfriend    nbsp   My dad immediately gave an embarrassing laugh and said "oh  he'll  me  figure that out eventually  that's something that he has to learn to do on his own"   nbsp   I'm really hoping that my parents are starting to understand that they're not going to have grandchildren  Thank you  You have no idea how much everyone's words of love and encouragement have meant to me today  I am doing this for me  I am doing this for my family and I'm doing this because I know if I don't I won't make it much longer  Thank you for making me feel loved  important and strong   I made this same call on Friday  I have not considered suicide  but I understand the sitting there staring at your crying baby  being completely numb  I understand the guilt you feel as well  Fortunately we both seem to have very supportive husbands   Making that call will be the first start to us being the best moms that we possibly can be  I'm here for support if you need it  My wife and I got engaged while I was in college  Initially we wanted to wait until after graduation  but decided to move it forward cuz  why the hell not  We loved each other and we didn't want a big blowout wedding anyway  Also  my girlfriend at the time  Wife now  is 4 years older  my parents didn't like that at all   Especially when I was 18 and first started dating   I guess what I'm saying is  don't let anyone  including your parents  decide what you choose in life  If you're perfect for each other and have identified opportunities that will get you and your girl set up better for the future  do it  Be confident and decisive  hopefully your parents will come around and support you    7 years  2 kids  2 states  and 3 jobs later  happily married and my parents couldn't be happier with my "rogue" decisions   Maybe  But that's something you don't tend to find out until the 2nd movie night    Wow  Best Pep talk ever  Thank so much for the advice and I will try my hardest to follow it       This may sound weird  but consider yourself lucky  I wholeheartedly believe that experiences like these give us more context in the wild happy times in our lives  We learn more about ourselves and what's important and it helps drive us  I'm glad you're feeling better about it all  Thank you so much  I am doing everything I can to give him the life he deserves and he needs a mama who is around to see him grow up  who can show him how to be strong and kind and loving  He needs me and that is enough for me   Sorry but the brain  not mind  is a neural tissue and not any form of muscle   I am so sorry for your loss  You are not alone  I too have had a similar experience I used to punch walls and make my knuckles bleed over stupid things  When I got angry at these things I remained angry the rest of that day  One day after already feeling frustrated my friend tripped me up just as a joke I was furious so I hit him at the time I didn't care I just walked away  However  when I got home I felt horrible my own friend I just punched in the face I looked for help through my parents and close friends on how I could control my anger  They said to stay calm in the situation  ignore whatever is frustrating you and then maybe talk to someone about it later  rather than do something you would regret  2 years later I'm very different my temper is much better and even when I still do get angry I just lay in my room and calm down with some music  If you have any hobbies like gaming or drawing try that when you are annoyed just to calm you down    Hope this helps  At least she told you she was not interested  It gives you closure rather than being ghosted  See that's part of my dilemma  the only real aspiration I've had is to travel but I know for a fact even though it's currently financially feasible I feel like I'll struggle to get back on my feet when I return  She explained to me that watching me masturbate is more fun for her than having sex which is why I've been doing it  But she was never like this before  I don't know what spurned this voyeuristic fetish   I've always made more money than her but she's never had an issue with it   Also we don't communicate enough lately so you're right about that  Lately all I do is work  buy groceries  come home and beat off   I'm going to clean the place up tonight and I'm NOT masturbating for her  Even if she begs and cries   I don't plan on having children  My wife and I have had lengthy discussions about it in the past  So don't worry about that last thing  Although I have heard from my previous doctor that uncircumcised men are at a greater risk of contracting HIV and other sti's  Especially among men who have sex with men  Not sure why that would be but I'm not a doctor  Nobody is buying that  Everyone is busy  What do you actually love about the environment  There are other environments where people come for a common purpose and are friendly   I tried to become social at raves based on what I read about them  That accomplished very little  and in retrospect it seems like a mistake  I don't know what was wrong  Based on my experience  it's as if the stuff I read about raves were all lies  It's also amazing how little the drugs helped   I'm still surprised and confused by how badly that went  I've had better times at sober group social gatherings a few times since  but far too few times to make a difference in my life overall  Thanks man  Ye don't know why she got all surprised when I said I was interested in her  She did the same thing when she asked me out on the first date  she changed her mind in the last minute and I had to convince her to meet me  Someone on this forum told me she would do it again but I didn't listen   They  are  ignorant  Complete and valuable my ass You're not ugly  and I'm not just saying that nor am I trying to sound gay   I'm a dude and yes  I live in the UK   I've seen your posts and stop trying to get others on the internet to validate how you look  If you stay indoors a lot get a gym membership or find a hobby besides from gaming  I seriously hated my life 4 years ago but when I began to excercise and go out more I felt so much better  It doesn't have to be excercise  just find something you like and make a goal  When you achieve that goal you'll feel a lot better in yourself and you won't have a low self esteem  When you go outside  no one gives a shit how you look trust me  I used to feel the same but the more time I spent worrying on how others perceived me the more I wasted my life away  I know how it feels when people look at you in weird ways or snarl  Those people are not worth thinking about and I don't think you'll ever get over that fact but that's life  It's a bitch and you got to grit your teeth and deal with it  You won't die a virgin if you go outside and do stuff  Don't try and eventually they'll come to you  Be patient  Thank you for the love  Parenting is by far the most roller coaster ride of emotions I will ever experience and I'm bipolar so that's saying a lot  I love my family and I couldn't imagine my life without them and I can't imagine what theirs would be without me  I need to stick around I need to be that annoying nag of a mother for the rebellious teen years I need to watch him grow up and teach him how to be kind and humble I need to show him how to be strong and what that really means   I appreciate the sympathy  I feel bad for my dogs too  I wish my wife would take them for a walk instead of thinking about my penis all day  Thank you  We can do this  In the exact same boat  You aren't alone   Have you considered a shih tzu mix  My friend and I both have shih tzus and they are both really good dogs  They don't really shed and they are very loving  I think the only real downside is that their fur kinda does need some maintenance like brushing so they don't get knots and if you don't want them to have super long poofy fur a trip to the groomers can be expensive unless you do it yourself   I'm 100  ready and willing to spoil and love that dog till the ends of the earth  Thank you for confirming that fact that I really want a pug  It's so rare to see a comment like this on Reddit  and it really pleases me  I agree completely  Don't take the risks and try to be a stereotypical reckless teen  Be a safe and smart person      I don't have a significant problem with this comparing my life to others stuff  For me the worst part of social media is putting too much of myself into it and expecting too much out of it  I've spent many years interacting with people on Facebook and gotten practically no lasting benefit from that  It doesn't seem to be a place where one can create significant friendships  It can at best temporarily alleviate loneliness in an addictive way   As an FA  I do see some value in it  as long as I don't get too pointlessly invested and addicted  Gym  meet new people  set yourself goals and when you achieve them  e g deadlift or benchpress a certain amount  you'll have more pride  Follow certain sub reddits such as r fitness  get involved   Inbetweeners is so good  It's like a teen Peep Show  why not just watch cuckold porn  I know you have a girlfriend and all  but if you're into that shit  that's what porn is for  It's tough man  success is never easy  Well either way good luck and wish the best for you man     PS lol don't blame you for thinking I was a dick  You're pretty tall and good looking from what I can see  but I must have replied to you a dozen times over the last 2 years from my various accounts  You've never written back   I don't understand why you copy and paste these threads over and over  only to never check the replies  Thank you  I'm dyslexic so it's hard for me to speak what I really mean out loud because my brain runs 50 miles a minute and I stumble over phrases and words but when I can type or write at a slower pace it's much easier to get my thoughts in order  even if I misspell things or use improper grammar  Sometimes that doesn't really work but I try to make my thoughts as clear as I can so I can understand myself too  It's pretty cathartic when writing is the only way you can truly get your thoughts out clearly   All the girls I was interested in  roughly 14 so far I guess  were girls like this  But none of them have romantical interest in me    My mother reacts like a toddler  She throws tantrums when she doesn't get her way  Sometimes her words get through to me and hurt me  but I'm slowly learning to accept that what she says reflects more on her than on me  I now recognise that she is emotionally abusive and try to keep my distance from her  I cannot change her  but I can respond to her storms with calm  It's a difficult choice  but the right one  because buying into her arguments validates her childish behaviour   Even mild ocean waves can knock a wader off their feet and makes floating not easy to do  without a tube or floaty of some kind   so it's not a calm experience like in a swimming pool   Plus  the salt in the ocean water will make you dearly regret opening your mouth    On the flip side  the ocean and beach can be really pretty  especially seeing the little sea creatures in the waves     Freshwater rivers and lakes tend to be opaque  which can freak some people out     Yeah  maybe so because it's nearly impossible for a woman to be single throughout all or most of their 20's  because women don't have to be the initiators Hi   I was in a really bad place myself a few years ago  I reached out to friends who tried to help me themselves but one thing became very clear  it did not work  The only time I actually saw improvement in my mental health was when I was sent to an outpatient therapy program at a hospital near me  I know it must be tough as you don't want to lose the friendship  but you should tell someone  I'm not sure how old you are  but maybe parents  a close relative  anyone who can "take control" of the situation and really help get him the help he needs  One thing should be stressed  you cannot take someone else's life in your own hands  and that is what you are doing by listening to him and maybe giving advice  but not helping him get outside care  My friends neglected to tell someone about my situation because they thought that "I might end up hating them" "Never talking to them again" etc  but the fact of the matter is that I almost ended up dead  Don't put this kind of pressure on yourself or your friend  He needs outside help  and you should do everything in your power to get that help to him  I hope this is helpful  given that I don't know everything about the situation  Good luck These posts are so dumb   Humans are wired to need social and romantic connection   If you are FA and completely undesirable and cannot get a partner and have likely never had one thats going to be hard to deal with mentally for anyone     This post might apply to some normies who freak out when they are single for a couple months but this kind of stuff doesn't belong here   Its one thing to be single for a little while  its another thing to be single forever       I've been getting really into meditation and buddhist teachings and I think it may be possible to feel at ease and complete regardless of your circumstances through years and years of intensive practice but I'm pretty sure thats not what this dumb facebook repost shit is getting at    Ya definitely  You'll then for sure figure out of it is idolization or exclusive preference  Glad it helped a bit man  Happy new years   And that's what you need to assess  Look to the future maybe put some money aside  travel and you will have some money back home to start you career I get the same thing from my friends family  Here's the way i see it  some people find love at 16 in high school and grow old together  Some people meet a significant other at work  they settle down  grow apart  go through a messy divorce and then find love again in their 50s  Some people think they'll never settle down and then meet someone who changes everything  Other people never find that person and instead invest in good friends and family   The truth of the matter is that none of us have any idea what's in store for us and that  in my opinion  is what makes each 365 day trip around the Sun worthwhile    Although we like to tell ourselves otherwise  finding a partner in crime is something we have very little control over  As long as  1  you're doing everything you can to make yourself happy   learning new things  visiting new places  eating good food  challenging your body   whatever it takes  and  2  you're making some effort to meet new people  then you can be safe in the knowledge that you're doing everything you can to get your "happily every after"  In the meantime  just enjoy the ride  He likes you and has a little anxiety  You pulled    Without even knowing I guess  I am really curious what is she going to say  so please keep us updated   I specifically wanna know what she says when you tell her that you did what she asked and now you think it would be fair if she does what you ask    On the other hand  in Romania and I am pretty sure that in most of Europe  most of the men are uncut   That might be right about STDs  but I read somewhere that those numbers in statistics are used wrongly and the risks are not that great   I mean  I don't think it matters if I am cut or uncut when I fuck without a condom someone who has HIV  Right  You didn't do anything wrong  she tested you by putting you in this shitty situation and you failed to her test  This is the period of the year when women need a boyfriend for the family  Thanksgiving  nye  chirstmas    When she saw her ex sex partner she felt excited and tested you to see if you could make a good partner for after valentine's day     Women do crazy stuffs like this all the time and rationalize it by crazy reasons    This isn't to alarm you but to chill you  this shitty stuff happens all the time  now you are warned  Just act cool  stop apologizing or looking unconfident and she could be attracted to you in a few weeks   Are you trolling  That's a lot of matches  it's a figure of speech  what i meant by that is that verbal and argumentative skills are skills just like any other  you learn  grow  by challenging yourself beyond the limits of what you're already capable of  and in that way  it's like a muscle  too  Very cool  man  Sounds like you're talking about meditating and mindfulness  Absolutely   If you ever need someone to talk to or need any advice  don't be afraid to message me     I'm glad you wrote back  50 in 70  Have you ever heard the term  "beer goggles " That's when a person goes into a bar and everybody looks rather ordinary  The men seem okay  the women look okay  but nobody stands out to you  Then you have a beer  And another  and maybe a third  Suddenly  as the hour passes  the women all look prettier  and the men seemed more accomplished  Heck  even the guy at the billiards table is cleaning up  You have another  OMG  Look at the woman who just walked in  She's GORGEOUS  You feel all flustered and think  "I'll bet she wouldn't want to talk to the likes of me " And then she walks right up to you and says  "Hey  50 on 70    I heard you were lonesome  Want to sit in my car and have another beer " Of course  you do  Next thing you know  the windows are steamed up and her angry husband is beating on the window    That's pretty much what happened to you and Amy  Only you weren't wearing beer goggles  you were wearing GRIEF goggles  I don't know what her agenda was  but it had nothing to do with you    How could I not talk to "a person like you " A person like you who risked everything to save a baby  And now you're separated from your family  which in the long run  might be the best thing that ever happened to you    I was once like you  My mother and sisters meant everything to me  I discovered after my mother literally didn't care that her boyfriend left me to die  unconscious on the road in bitter cold temperatures  that my love was misplaced  The same with my sisters  BUT  over the years  I have cobbled together a real family of friends who never would leave me to die    This is an awful lot to think of  and I know how much pain you are in  but please cross suicide off your bucket list  There are so many people in this world who could do with a friend such as yourself  You are a good person  a fine young man  Everyone makes a mistake  especially when they're blinded by whatever goggles they happen to be wearing at the moment     That guy is a stud compared to me  I have two fulltime jobs  I work 77 hours a week with no days off except for holidays so it might work There's a book  called "Fuck Your Feelings"  Read it   Video version for maximum feels   https   www youtube com watch v MkOeb QP0LI   I absolutely agree  I have always thought the idea of needing someone to "complete" you was silly  I am a complete person  I would love to be in a happy  fulfilling relationship  but even then  I think it's nonsensical to expect someone  no matter how wonderful  to come along and "complete" you  If I was  socially  valuable  surely someone would've seen that by now and considered me worth dating   A nickel on the sidewalk wouldn't go over 20 years without being picked up    Cops in Canada make 80 100k a year  19 years for 46 thousand sounds terrible tbh  Interesting Being open is key   But I have to comment that I am extremely impressed and proud that you have had those conversations with your husband   That you were able to tell him what you may need at different points and that you both remember it   That is impressive and shows just how strong you are     I have an incredibly hard time articulating what I need  because for so long I have lived my life for others and not myself   Not only did I see asking for my needs as selfish  I also found it nearly impossible   I just recently started to make myself a priority  with the help of my incredible ldr so   At the same time I am hitting a really rough patch of depression and new hormone changes to top it off   You have inspired me to try harder to articulate better   You are an amazing woman and mother   Getting the help you need is only bettering yourself  which is never weak   I think of it like going to school  you are learning and doing all you can to be the best you can be   Going to professionals for our emotional problems is just that  learning more about ourselves and our illnesses  learning how to approach our hurdles   Researching what we need to do or what we can take to help   That is something to be proud of     Many hugs for you on your journey    Maybe I do  I don't know  I don't what I'm missing out on because I've never had friends  All I do know is that I'm miserable and not having friends is one source of it  I can't will myself not to care about these things  Basically the girl would keep leading me on tease me so when we finally got around to it  it was a hatefuck with no intimacy I loved Rammstein as a kid  Couldn't understand shit and still can't  don't speak German  Can I have a third option  I'd rather not be born   Hi  First off  I'm really sorry about the lack of a support system you have  It is clear from your post that you really want  and need  help  and although your parents may not be able to provide it  I would recommend taking advantage of the counselor at your school  Although he or she cannot treat you or give you therapy  if you explain the full situation  they may be able to help you find a solution  There may be some therapy programs with low or waived fees  Group therapy is usually cheaper than personal therapy  and one or two hours a week is a start   I'm not sure how you feel about lying to your parents  if that's what would need to happen  but maybe these few hours that you leave the house could be attributed to a church group   Your father seems like he would be supportive of you  Is going to him again an option  Maybe explain to him that you really believe you need help and that your mother does not understand the gravity of the situation  The last thing that I will say is that if you go to the school counselor and say you're thinking of killing yourself  they will have to require you to take a psychiatric exam at a nearby clinic  Dude 77 hours a week  WTF do you do  And why  How old are you and where do you live  Well for starters you look like a male model  Have you tried other dating sites  Like OKCupid  Tinder has always crossed me as a sleazy place  Thank you I hope you find your strength as well    Perhaps  But everyone has time for pussy  Small business owners who are never really off and are always working are married with kids   No  it wouldn't make much of a difference  Always use a condom  Wow I had no idea  To me it shouldn't matter as long as they have a key and are given the lock and keys from the door originally who cares   lol this is very funny and sad at the same time If you are absolutely sure they are cooking the production books you should notify the CEO   However  be prepared to have to leave the company for any number of reasons   If you blow the whistle on the bad guys they won't be very happy   If you are wrong and it gets dicey they they will not be very happy for that reason   The only person you will be making happy is the CEO and the shareholders  but for that "good energy" to gain traction it may take a while and in the mean time you are in limbo   So  tread carefully   The correct thing to do is let the CEO know    not HR   this type of problem is a lot deeper than HR can handle   Good luck  I was at a murder mystery with my family and I was dressed as a super hero  My love life was somehow placed under the microscope when someone asked if I was still single    By the end of it everyone was saying my character should be Captain Friendzone   Fun times  I have  this too  Made major  progress on it in recent months  but a total disaster backside last night  so I'm on your spot now    No idea if it was just one bad night  or something that will take time to rebuild from  Either way   what worked for me was approaching every day with a mindset that I wanted to make and build personal connection with anyone there is an opportunity to do that with  Often it was short exchanges  but the way out of this in my case was to break that social anxiety mental block in a 'Death by 1000 papercuts' way  chipping away a little here  a little there  trying to create a pattern and routine of the right mindset and right action     EDIT  oh  in my case  I also have a problem hearing in a certain frequency that happens to be the din of party chatter  that it's hard to pick out enough consecutive sounds from a person to understand them  In those cases  I just agree and smile and try to mirror their emotion as they're talking   This is the age where people make life long friends and due to work I don't think that'll be possible  If I continue like this then in several years time when I get married I won't even have a best man let alone any guests to invite to the wedding  That's a situation that scares me  If I'm having relationship problems I literally have no one to talk to about it  No one to talk to about anything really  But if I go into college next year I feel like because I've been in a professional environment for so long my social skills won't be great and I'll come across as boring  At a true crossroads here  I pay for 7  usually get 3 ish  My ping is usually 60 but I want to connect to my american friends that i left  So i dont know if there is a way to lower the ping so i can play with them  Ok  I think I'm risking a downvote brigade here  but I hope this helps   First of all  it sounds like the situation really sucks for you  and I'm sorry you went through it  No one should have treated you that way   Something that jumps out at me is your total lack of responsibility taking  You acknowledge at the start of your post that some people might ask you why you didn't leave  and you handwaved it with some bullshit about money  I know it's bullshit  and I think you do too    Hear me out here   PTSD is highest in people who have an "external locus of control"  google that if you're not familiar  and see  here for one study supporting my claim  https   www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles PMC3917873     That's because if you may be attacked at any time by an abuser that you can't stop  it's terrifying and stressful  So if something bad happens to you   and   you have an external locus of control  then you   know   the bad thing might happen  and it feels as if you can't stop it from happening or do anything about it if it does happen   The bad news is  sometimes abusive people will try to abuse you   The good news is    it's not true that you can't stop it  You are in control of your own life     Money isn't the reason you stayed with a shitty room mate for 8 years  You made that choice over and over  and you could have made a different choice  I understand that there were factors that made it easier to stay or whatever  but that doesn't change the fact that you could have  at basically any time  chosen to leave  Millions of people have had shitty room mates and no money and still managed to leave  If they can figure it out  you can figure it out  And in fact    you did figure it out    you left  you blocked her  Good for you  You could have done it 7 years ago too   I predict that if you  develop a more internal locus of control  https   www verywell com cope with stress and become more resilient 3144889   you will feel much better  stop having anything like PTSD  and you will live a better  happier life   Good luck  I agree with this   I don't know why I would want to feel bad about a livestyle that i'm going to have to live with anyways  If i'm going to be FA you better bet that i'm going to make the best of it  even if the rest of society considers me a loser   Though I honestly only this year just found out getting kissed on new years eve was a thing people feel the need to do  Usually you get thanked  Tell them  There's no reason not to  They can't really do anything negative to you anyways  That is very good advice but the only problem is that other people do know  He has had discussions with his family about this multiple time and they are fully aware of the scale of the situation yet that never really changed anything  He is a senior in highschool and the highschool counselors and several teachers are also aware of the situation  Despite the fact that all of his friends  family  girlfriend  and school counselors know about his depression and suicidal tendencies no one seems to really do much in the way of taking control and helping guide him towards professional help  I know I can't take someone else's life in my own hands but I feel like I have no other option  Despite that  what you said was very helpful though  thank you so much for taking the time to respond to my post  I appreciate it more than you know  fuck my ass  whale thanks anyways man  fuck my ass  thanks anyway man  It's not that I do things not productive while at work  for example facebook  instagram and these things  my SO gets mad at me sometimes for not replying her for a couple of hours  They probably had the time before they got super busy  I would have the time to have fuck  30min 1hr a day  but not to meet new people go out on dates  Plus setting up a date that will work with both of our schedules might be a challenge   I understand how you feel  Pretty sure the vast majority of this sub does  Loneliness can definitely be debilitating  Have you tried to rely on your family members at all  I'm sure they'd help    You may be placing too much emphasis on having a SO  It won't solve all of your loneliness issues  Last year I moved away from my misses and felt pretty isolated until I figured out how to be alone without being lonely  I wish you the best of luck  things will get better   talk to a lawyer   In US  you should have had uninsured underinsured

day  Please forgive me for not crediting it to the person  but there's some good stuff in here that I've passed on to friends in your situation                     What Ive learned from Being Unemployed for 25 months Despite having more skills than ever in my life  Ive learned employers seem to want a younger worker  I learned   That my body has past injuries that prevent me from doing heavy physical labor that I once did so easily  But I dont have to give in to pain and soreness every time and I can push past it   I really need to scare myself at least once a week by doing something outside my comfort zone  Trying something new or unusual  however small or large makes me feel good   I should use my mind more  my body less and patience is useful  That being unemployed is corrosive to the soul and mind and NOT to give in to negative thinking   My sweet  sweet wife is a bed rock in my life that I never imagined when I married her  She continues to give unconditional love despite my aimless direction  And Im humbled by it and with her  with each passing day   Following my interests when I was younger  allowed me a full  interesting and fruitful life  But now I cant seem to recreate it again   To reach out to people for help that I need support  ideas  and their thoughts  and interest  But as much as I need people  I need to follow my hunches  and feelings too and in other wordsI need both worlds   I need something to look forward to each day  however small or trivial  Ive learned I can be happy with a good book  a hot meal  laughing with friends  seeing my wifes car in the garage  or my kitty arch her back to me with a look of loving trust on her face   Laughter brightens gloomy thoughts  a gray day and it gives me a burst of optimism that lasts for hours   That on those days when a smile feels like it might crack my face  these are precisely the days I need to do it the most   My kittiesChristy and Pepper  need to be around me  resting against me  and touching me constantly  And when theyre not around me  its because they sleep more than any animal I know   Volunteering in the community and helping others helps me  It elevates and encourages me  almost as much as it helps them   I discovered friends were frequently people I dont even know  Like Ken  Nick and Bill who helped and encouraged me for no other reason than they cared about me as another human being   People remember me from teaching stints and it always impresses me how far reaching and long lasting that is   I learned again  the only constant in life is change and I have to roll with it  learn from it  embrace it  and ultimately  accept it   I dont need as much money as I thought I did   Ive learned the Federal government and our state have a heart  and by extending my UE benefits to me  they do know and they do care   At times when I think people are insensitive  cold and un feeling  someone will  for no reason at allshow me that Im dead wrong  Like the nice guy who asked me if I was waiting for the parking spot  then with a smile drove on to look further  I also learned that   Sometimes I worry for no reason at all that I obsess about stupid things and in general  find things to feel bad about   I have tons and tons of skills and that most things that I doI do them very well   That going through old email  and contacting prospective employers from months back  was very smart  And when I got the interview  showing up 5 minutes early  instead of just on time was very smart   My creative solution to get hired even impressed a hardened  experienced recruiter  And now that I have a job  I learned that unemployment passes  Really  If you read this far  and youre unemployed  keep looking and applying and dont lose the faith  Believe it will get better and imagine the job you want  And visualize you getting it  Every day  believe it possible and say  today is the day  C  Russel   It makes you feel like you're not on the same level as the other people in the group or that you don't belong as well   Yes  exactly  Since it might also be with a person you already are friends with and feel comfortable around one on one with  it makes you feel like in the grand scheme of their world  you mean very little to them "if there are better people around" I used to write down on a book the things I had to do  but I noticed that spent quite some time writing things and thinking on what I should write  time that I could use reviewing processes or making meetings    I know this is a habit I should keep  but it can't take away too much time   And  about deadlines  most of the times the engagements are either too short or the client's don't collaborate with the auditing  like  I try to schedule meetings or ask for some documents and they don't deliver in time  When I speak to the manager about it  the answer is     You're not asking correctly     You should learn how to solve your problems     Stay next to them until they give you what you need   I even asked a couple of managers this last week what's the importance of an financial audit to the client  because this last client wasn't giving a fuck to what was going on  I'm looking at it with a glass half full approach  There are a lot of people alone or in bad relationships who struggle in other aspects of life  Other than being FA I have a pretty good easy life where I don't have stress and get to do cool shit  FWIW I'm not talking about material possessions since I'm rather minimalist but mostly travel  experiences  etc  I've simply dedicated all my life force into things I'm good at rather than futile attempts at things I'm not good at  It's basic StrengthFinder math    talent X effort   success  Focus your efforts on stuff you're good at  People who suck at dating aren't going to yield a high return by spending so much effort in areas they lack natural talent  You're better off focusing on making yourself a better person in areas you have talent  and just let everything else fall as it may  Acceptance of possibly being alone but making the best out of the rest of life is the key to FA happiness  Sadness hits first  but quickly turns to rage instead  Where's my bottle    Just freaking ask  Literally it's not a huge deal  Try to go someplace for the first hangout  maybe grab coffee or ice cream  Just be yourself  don't worry about being a "nice guy"  that's a BS excuse that you tell yourself to psych yourself out   I believe in you  you got this  Just take a shot brother  Im not either  whats tldr  I've never been able to make friends so I relate to this all  particularly the part about it getting harder as you get older  I've observed that people are less kind and treat each other more like strangers when they get older  They lose their humor and become unfeeling assholes to anyone who isn't friends or family    https   np reddit com r adulthate comments 5hqrvm why are adults such effin shitty assholes     After I returned home I quickly contacted his insurance  Turns out the car he hit me with had no insurance so there is nothing they can do for me       If he had no insurance who were you calling and how did you obtain this information      If you went to the emergency room were the police also involved  Do you have this guy's address  Your only option to get him to pay is to sue him for the cost of repairs or replacement  whichever is cheaper   Man  I'm sorry  1  Work on your self confidence  You don't think you're good enough  which is a blatant incorrect statement considering you're married to her  2  Stop doing it  You're causing yourself major pain that you could have stopped  Stop  Hurting  Yourself  For HER pleasure  That's all sorts of fucked up  3  Clean ALL the spots  You're taking responsibility in letting your dogs lick that stuff  Do NOT let her take control of doing that to your dogs  That is selfish of both of you  regardless of how cowardly you are in the relationship  4  Honestly  you view looks as the most important thing  and that's just seriously not all there is to a relationship  She's broken  like really broken  and she's breaking you as well  Like you gotta stand up for yourself  There is NO other way around this  You will not be able to do anything else unless you confront her  I mean  you can run away and take the dogs and peace out  but I feel like you want to make it work  Just realize that it's not a relationship to save if she's using the relationship to get her way  Does it even matter if she doesn't love you  so long as she's labeled as your wife  You're in a twisted relationship and she needs help  If you can't get her to see that  and she's hurting you  then it's time to move on  There are plenty of hot women you will be able to get  Yes  it is totally possible  And there are hot women who won't treat you like a sex object like she is  gaming arcade    LARP    Paintball    Locked Room puzzles  I think that that's a solid idea  I'll keep checking out jobs and apartments out of necessity  but at the same time it's a good idea to keep looking at that too  just to see if there's a constructive resolution    Either way  I'm probably going to limit my contact with him  My only concern is that he's going to get aggressive with my mum when he's finished yelling at me  I hate having too much free time  and working long hours makes me forget that im single as fuck  Yikes   Sometimes we get into a hole and it is okay to feel the way you are feeling  Somedays you will be better with this  other days worse  Focus on the people you are comfortable talking with  love you or understand your having trouble   Also I suggest looking into journalling  this should help get out your thoughts without having to speak out loud  There are a few different ways you can do this  just research which sounds best for you  She's sounds crazy  RUUUUNNN FOREST RUUUUNNN  The reason I use tinder is because you don't have to write that much about yourself  I don't have an education and never had a job in my life  I'm currently attending a program that helps people with mental illness find a job  That's nothing I want to put in my profile description   Be prepared that the pug will love your fianc more than you  But you will be good enough until they get home  Pug life is brutal  Maybe he's using a different app  The app I'm using hides the sidebar  I'm so sorry for your loss    Same  but sorry you feel that way it's not a good feeling   i would just go for it man    life is too short to contemplate everything you said you have good chemistry and she sounds awesome so yh i understand you dont wanna ruin the work relationship but hey nothing ventured nothing gained  think of the great prehaps  I think you're on the right track wanting to see a counselor  Some people are just wired to be high stress  and it sounds like you may be one of us  Believe me  I could be a professional mattress tester and I would find a way to overstress about it  The key is balance  You need a hobby that is stress relieving  and you need to place limits on your time that you're available to other people  Don't even worry about keeping up a lifestyle  if you're traveling that much  you don't have time for that  Get a small comfortable apartment with an honest cleaning lady  Use a car service or uber  you don't need to waste time on upkeep and maintenance  on a car that you drive less than a third of the time  Simplicity helps a lot  the less you have to worry about  the better   Yea you're lucky there  How did it not turn into to a felony   I've definitely had my fair share of experiences where cops didn't know how much weed I had and thankfully they always guessed under an ounce  I had a similar situation but  it was for mania   I talked to my pDoc and he told me to consult with my school ombudsman  'emotional inteligence'  equally as important in any social situation  Its one thing knowing how to express yourself and knowing how to get your point across but picking up on social cues  body language etc will help with connecting with people by simply knowing when to speak  when to observe and when to 'understand'  You've finally adapted to your lifestyle  It's like listening to a great song and once you listen to it the 15th time  it's lost its flavor  Do you have other ideas you want to pursue instead  Wow    Absolutely tell everyone youre active with  Drop her  man  She sounds insecure and  frankly  you do as well  and there's nothing wrong with that at 15    because who isn't     but it's not worth all the hurting  The mature move would be to distance yourself  And after a certain point  if you don't and you keep throwing yourself into this cycle  it's on you  Do something about it while you can  I was raised in a miIitary household and I relate to this so strongly  We moved every 2 3 years though  So not quite as often  I try to explain it to even my parents but they can't relate   If you want to talk to someone going through the same thing  feel free to message me  I'd love to chat      Probably not arrested  but talked to  for sure Time Sounds like you need some new friends  Go where you're celebrated  not where you're tolerated  me and my wife got married in UK  before moving to US  but only did that to make visa application easier   As she is already here  you can get married  and apply for a  greencard  https   www uscis gov green card green card through family green card immediate relative us citizen inside   which will make it easier to do other things than just school  You may have to get sponsorship from family if your income is not enough   As you will be married  it puts her on a fast track to become a citizen  in only  3 years  https   www

easier  You are sexually inexperienced  The ideal partner has respect for your boundaries and if your guy knows the swinging thing is a no no for you  yet is still pushing it  you two are not compatible  "I got reassurance for consent"  Based on what you've written here  I think it's ok   You didn't have sex with her  and you seem genuinely concerned    which tells me you were fairly respectful   If you're worried it was inappropriate because of sobriety  or that she is uncomfortable       Try talking about it and tell her you're concerned and ask her how she feels about what happened    Fucking tell him  I know how you feel  I'm divorced because I couldn't have kids and he wanted them  I have a chronic illness so it's very hard for me to work full time but I'm not sick enough to get SSI  which isn't a living wage anyway  And www reddit com r RandomKindness  is where you want to hang out   hugs It may not be related to the psychotic features  but it may be related to your mental health  Which  correct me if I'm wrong  you seem to be concerned about   You guys sound like a good candidate for marriage counseling  The key that counseling reinforces is communication  I owe my relatively smooth marriage to the communication my wife and I have  Counseling could show you how to communicate in a neutral way and through mediator that could calm things down should they get too hot   Hang in there  Some people here have never even  had  friends  much less have them currently  as someone who was also experiencing shit I can sum up my advice with life gets better    all you need is the right mindset you sound really confused but just remember you never lose until you give up  in a few years your gonna look back at this post and laugh due to how much change has occured  Yes  that's one of the best options  didn't think of it at the moment   Rammstein lyrics often lose their "magic" when they are translated  Another good one is "Schwarzes Glas"  only exists as a demo  apparently producer didn't want it on an album  which is about ugliness and how ugly people are often blamed for things they never did with lines like "guilty  because we are ugly"  but sadly I'm not very good at translating the impact of songs  No one ever answers me though  What  is  the fucking point   Some people here don't get asked those questions because it's so obvious that they're saddled with intractable problems and thus are completely hopeless  Count your blessings  That may just be the bust of confidence I needed   I'm glad that you realize that you have things you want to change in your life and are trying to find solutions  To me that is already a huge step  My suggestion is to make  kind of like your post  a list of things you'd like to change but with small tasks to accomplish it   For example if your goad is to be independent then set goals such as     Searching for jobs in the area   Start saving some money  for example in buying less food and making it more therefore fulfilling the task of learning how to cook    Go to driving lessons  find a spot in the week when you can go and once you've finished lessons maybe you can get a vehicle by saving some money    Learn how to do stuff around the house  you can go to the internet and have several how to videos and such   This will take some time and a lot of effort but if you apply to it I'm sir you'll manage   It seems that you are struggling with depression and that's a hard problem to deal with  I think that's something that is better taken care of with someone who knows what he's  she's doing such as a doctor  There's also many alternative therapies   you can search and pick one   Hope this helps     Same here  Mid thirtysomething and it is not getting easier as time goes by     I feel like I missed out on so much  Never had the experience of teenage love so I feel in many ways my growth has been stunted  Post Partum depression is a real thing and those of us who already have mental health challenges are significantly more likely to suffer from it  You are describing classic signs of this and there is   nothing wrong with you for being overwhelmed and having these feelings   seriously  Everyone needs help  everyone needs support  and sometimes this comes in the form of a therapist and medication  You are absolutely making the correct decision to reach out for help and acknowledging that there is an issue is a HUGE step    You are so much stronger than you know right now and I know you can do this       Good luck and tons of  HUGS  and positive vibes   Haha sorry I didn't mean it to come off that way  I have friends  thank God  but some people don't even have that luxury  Thank you so much  Some people here are so repulsive for a variety of reasons that they never hear things like this  Thank you I really appreciate the encouragement and uplifting vibes  Hm    Have you considered visiting a counsellor or a therapist   Post to  r sex exactly what you said here  I guarantee that they'll have an answer for you  p I needed to hear this  Thank you  Honestly I know I'm stupid and need to stop because it'll only end in hurt but I started to think that it didn't matter because I loved her  I will make the effort to try and break off from it as best as I can Dude these sound fun as shit   If people follow you and are sheep you can turn this around by stopping the retarded sheep from bullying him  Seriously though  he might have depression or something so it'd be good to have a talk to him then he'll know someone has actually noticed him  You're young  You still have time to grow  to flourish  or to relax  Save as much as you can so that when you decide to  you can live comfortably  Meanwhile  a lot of this advice is great  You have wiggle room  remember that it WON'T be the end of the world if something goes wrong  This might not get the best results   Watching cuckold or reading cuckold stories will satisfy the fantasies  This calms you down and makes the fantasy go away for a bit  But it will return  Keep doing this and it will become more embedded in you  It'll become a habit  While this is might be preferable to the current situation  I think it's better to go the other way   I'd advise going to a therapist and working on the root of those fantasies  Maybe it can be helped   You could compare this distinction with working on anger issues  One  you could buy a punching bag and hit it while screaming every day  Or two  you could work with a therapist to find and hopefully remove the cause of all the anger   Anger issues and probably cuckold fantasies are not watermarked into your personality  I believe they can be altered  though incredibly easier said than done  Anything the pet do  your liable  That's the problem with having pets  Pigeons  well mainly their poop  can give you some pretty nasty diseases like cryptococcal meningitis   I'd you are going to keep it make sure to not inhale ingest any of its droppings  Have you considered joining the military  You may not think it's for you but it would definitely give you a purpose and kickstart to your life  Also  if you already have a certain amount of college credits you can join at higher rank just for that   although the amount of credit needed varies from branch to branch it's usually not that many   It may not be something you've ever thought about doing  but I would encourage you to at least do a little research to get a realistic picture the military  Understand that most people in the military are dedicated to things outside combat and will never even fire a weapon outside of basic training especially in the Navy and Air Force  And despite what people say the pay is actually pretty decent when you consider that you basically get free housing and food  etc  I think the starting monthly pay is  1449 00 a month  but you would be making more with college credits    It might or might not interest you but like I said  I think you would benefit from doing a little research to make sure you're not missing out on an opportunity for you    Whatever you decide I hope you find the right direction for your life and have a great 2017 and beyond  I would say since you're so indecisive don't go to college right out of high school  If you can travel the country do that  Just go and experience shit  In this moment that is honestly what I think you need to do    I joined the army back in 2002 and got out in 2010  I seen a lot and I understand your brain to a degree  You just have to get out there and experience what you can  After that you will go to school or whatever   what do you mean  My teenage daughter "Dad  I'm gay"   Me  "OK  Dinner's ready"    As a parent  my only concern is for how she might be discriminated against by the assholes of the world  I hope your family and friends come to the same place  OP  I have BP2   AD also  It took me 10 years to crawl out of darkness  I'm sad right now  r ship breakup  and I'm doing  all  I can to stop depression creeping up  It  is  a hard fight but your admittance is your willingness for change   You  can  do this  Trust is hard    but you have to    Hmmm this is a tuffy   It depends on the type of company that you work for  I'm sure that if you were to fail the test and they're a professional establishment then they will have some sort of employee confidentiality rule  at the end of the day  you  work for them and your job has nothing to do with your parents  Being under the age of 18 however could mean that your employer may take things to a personal level and tell your parents but that's just pure speculation  Also don't just up and leave over an "if"  You never know  you may pass and be in the clear but now you have no job   Yes  you are a bit of an idiot so don't smoke at all if you're going to be working within the next couple days  I guess  I don't really know how long it takes to get out of your system     In terms of a record  I doubt they'd take it to the police or anything like that as it really is an internal matter  Also if you were high on the job or whatever  which it sounds like you weren't  then it should be alright   The primary reason to do this drug test the day after NYE is precisely to catch employees such as yourself so it's unfortunate that your workplace conducts those for your sake     If they kept you on  even if the test came back positive  then yes it may be on some sort of record and you may receive disciplinary action but atleast you still have a job  As I say I doubt this would be passed onto the cops so it shouldn't affect future career asepcts or college or whatever  Life  How do i get to where u are lol  That sounds awesome   Edit  didn't finish reading the second half  That's what a lot of people want  Life isn't that deep  There's not much meaning to it you have to put the meaning there yourself whatever that may be   It sounds very much like an internal thing   Sure  he may have shut you down a little there but thats kind of a choice you have there in that moment to take it personally  dwell on it for the rest of the night and make an issue out of it   OR you could just laugh it off and turn it back on him in a joking manner   people have opinions  and we all exaggerate so theres no point in taking harm from it at all  just see it for what it is  you probably do it all the time without realising it   When you give attention to the negative aspects like that  you literally push yourself out of the conversation bc your state of mind has just shifted from an in the moment  engaged type to a reflective  analysis which probably went over every one else's head   If it really is a concern to you and keeps happening then maybe broach the topic with him when you are alone in a respectful way by letting him know it bothered you and you weren't sure how to feel about it   Jealousy can be a very bad thing  we all feel it   but those of us who can crush it in its tracks and move on quite rapidly are always better off   People are very receptive on a subconscious level and we don't realise but by thinking about the negative of a situation will literally change our body language to be less approachable by others   Be confident in what you have to say and if no one listens or reacts  who cares   Try again with equal enthusiasm and sooner or later people will pick up on your eagerrness to join in the discussion   Also  if we want others to respect our opinion we must first respect theirs  you might 'love' the show and It sounds like he's ok with that  but are you ok with him only barely enjoying the show    all the best i meant the no one ever answers me bit  You could leave an anonymous note explaining your situation What's the point in life  Thank you for the encouragement and sympathies  I want you to know that we can take control  it will be different for each of us and it will be extremely difficult but we can make it through and kick mental illness in the ass  I hope you find the strength and encouragement you need for your fight   As a swimmer    If you are going to learn  Learn at a pool  Pools are safe zones and with 0 currents  allows for you to practise techniques like keeping your head up and in water survival movements   Rivers are rough stuff  I would not do it  With raging waters and currents  1 bad sweep and you might cut yourself on rocks or smash yourself onto rocks  Never swim in rivers   For lakes and oceans  It varies from calm water to crazy ass waves  In these situations  the best you can do is keep your head above water and swim towards and coast  If not  Just float and curl for warmth   The shock of the cold might kick him  This is usually the hard part of ocean and lakes  All excellent advice  See a counselor too for yourself  Use the money you spent on your abuser boyfriend and pay a counselor or therapist if insurance doesn't cover any of it  Best of luck  Telling someone is definitely the right thing to do  It makes it out that the taddle tale is the bad one  but in this situation it's a very reasonable action to carry out  This  doubled with the fact that a popular and well known student is on his side  would definitely make that kids situation a lot easier  Well that's a good thing  God job   First of all  the Red Pill subreddit is the bottom of the bottom  don't even look at it because it's pretty much all bullshit to make sad guys feel better    Second  there may be societal pressure to achieve these things within a timeframe but it's important to note that you have to do what feels right to YOU  You can still enjoy yourself after being a teen  in fact  my best years are currently happening and I'm in my late 20's  Don't let others tell you what's right when it comes to achieving your own goals  you decide that  Do what makes you happy  I suppose I am concerned  I'm mostly curious as to why it's happening I worked through the night   At midnight when they started the count down I cried  thankfully not around anyone else in the building    Life changes and loneliness can certainly make New Year's just as depressing   It's a holiday with a sole focus on partying essentially   I've been over the whole party hype for years  but it doesn't mean it doesn't effect me   This past year found me moving to a new place where I know only a little family and my co workers   Any holiday can do this to us   You aren't alone  Hugs  Small thing  You mean Dickinson size  It grows with age  Don't be scared  Ducks come on all sizes  Big Dickson  small Dickson  and micro Dickson  Glad I could help  And yeah  if you don't like it  you don't like it  At least it's not huge and it won't be too hard to get rid of  It could definitely be worse  Good luck   Screw staying calm  Scream and cry and let that shit out Change his sexual orientation to straight and gender of his targets from male to female and see if that makes a difference in your perception  Why did you do it  What were you gaining  Were you lonely  Did you feel like you and your girl were growing apart  Were you just excited for attention and a self esteem boost  You'll do it again if you don't figure out why you did it in the first place  If you love her  you owe it to you both to get to the root of it so you stop the behavior    Ultimately its not the worst betrayal ever  but it is a betrayal of her trust in you  It can be worked through but understand it will take communication and earning back her trust  Whether you tell her or not you still have to communicate the core issue and work with her to overcome it    Oh  and don't be a shithead  Don't do it again   You have achieved so much  just remember to breathe and is there no possible to call in more people help you take some time off There is nothing wrong with asking him to move in together so long as he agrees to it  You can't force him to move in but he can't force you to be in a relationship  Depending on how long you've been dating for and your age  there has to be goals you reach that move the relationship forward and this is one of them especially after 8 years  Try not to make it about the finances and more about wanting to progress the relationship  I assume you want to move in with him regardless  Just think about the relationship and let the finances take the back burner in your head but don't feel guilty  I go fishing  It's very healing to me  so thank  you  for the encouragement too  Best wishes OP      big hugs well that's very subjective if different for everyone depending on your religion and background but everyone has a meaning for it in the words of Albert campus " the meaning of life it literally what's stopping you from killing yourself" Such a good show  The amazing thing is is that i relate to a lot of these characters so much  Even mr gilbert with his bitter and sour views on life   D I'm not a lyrics person at all  so the meaning of the song is secondary  And judging by those Lindemann band lyrics  I might be better off not translating anything lol  I think if you are at a good place in your relationship and can afford to do so you should move out  26 seems more than old enough to move out unless he likes being taken care of by his mom maybe  But I think it's all about how you approach it  If he loves you I would think he would move because it would make you happy and  him in turn too Well I might as well kill myself  yep all the time  The same thing I tell myself every year  This year I'll be more social  I'll talk to people  go out more  make friends  ask girls out    then I end up never knowing what to say and just going through my day then sitting at home alone  I want a real social life so bad  I just have no idea how to make it happen  Now you're starting to believe your own BS  Holding together a marriage with children is constant work  Stop pretending that you would have a love life if you just worked less  You wouldn't   please dont you have a strong purpose you just dont realise it yet  https   youtu be 6ipVHyKnx6Y This will pass  and one day you will be the light in someone else's life  Until then listen to the song link above and know that you're not all alone in the world   As someone in a similar situation to you I just wanted to chime in here and say that you are doing the right thing    My husband works similarly long hours  and I too am alone with our 10 month old most of the time   It's hard   Add depression anxiety into the mix and it can feel impossible   You're doing great  Your child is warm  fed  and loved  and t hat's the most important thing  Asking for help when you need it is not a sign of weakness  it is a show of your commitment to being the best you possible for your child    it probably doesn't count for much coming from a stranger on the Internet  but i am proud of you  If you ever need to talk to another mother going through what you're going through  or literally just vent  please don't hesitate to message me   Stay strong  you're wonderful   There are some truly evil sociopathic people out there  Ive been a victim too  it stays with you for life and like lizards they just keep looking for more prey  Telling your story here will be helpful to others   Thank you man  I really appreciate it Sounds like she desperately needs some therapy    that's messed up No joke  try recording yourself  Audio diaries or whatever  Just practice talking about what you want to say  Thank you for the kind words  You're spot on about the red pill sub  I'll take them to heart     Then pick one city and leave out the drive part  Round trip flights are less expensive    As for the coast  eeeeehhh  It is a lot to driving and further than you think it is  The coast gets old and for the most part you are just hauling ass  It takes between a day and a half to two days to make the trio if driving direct with minimal stops   gives medal  Well when will I   "When life gets better"   Because that's what I've been told  but coinecedently it never has  And you're the only person who bothered to reply to this  Just goes to show no one really gives a fuck here  This entire sub  and suicide watch  are just places we go to vent  We get given basic advice most of the time and it very rarely changes people's lives  You are wonderful for caring about a total stranger and offering up an ear to hear  Thank you for your kindness and understanding   Then why the Hell was she on Tinder   Im pretty sure I'm a porn addict  I am aware of it  Hard to stop  it sounds like you're just not invested enough in these people and that you yourself don't really care if you hang out or not  People pick up on these things to   Since you even considered dropping them for another social group if not for how hard it is to meet new people in your situation  Kinda shows you don't really care about them that much    If you care about them and want them to put in an equal effort  make it clear with your actions  Otherwise peoples opinion of you could very well be "well he's a nice guy but he doesn't seem to mind if we hang out or not  i won't bother"  You have to be prepared to put in more effort than everyone else  if want you want is the be a 'social butterfly'   Its a ripple effect  you have to be super consistent for a long time but sooner or later people see how carefree and giving you are  and will naturally want to be around you more   In small towns its quite easy for people to get stuck in a closed minded frame  of mind 'bubble'  which can make finding decent chat a lot harder  not impossible though   A lot of superficial 'hey how are you  good" conversations ect  You need to be able to offer more than that  excite those around you with your tales and experience  Go travelling and you will see that there are many open receptive people just dying to connect with you   Yeah  shame is about 50  of my brain now  Luckily I'm so vexed most of the time that I can shift focus off the shame  I'm 26 and I live in the Northern Nevada area  You  I kept trying to for 5  years and everything I tried  even though positive short term  ultimately ended with me having some kind of breakdown and I can't take anymore failure Dump your boyfriend  Simple as that  You clearly want to explore and having your boyfriend isn't going to help  You are young   You will find another boyfriend later on too  So sorry for your loss   My dad died on December 3rd   You're in my thoughts  Mine wasn't worth writing home about at that age    There's a  lot  of variation in time frame for development   But you're in the zone     Well  the good part about 14 is that from here on  every year you get more control over your life   And dude  you've got 20 more years for romance  why waste time on wanting it now     This isn't what you want to hear  but focus on what you have for a little while   Your one friend  is he nice   It's awesome that you like lifting   You can run away  but you'd be smart to make a plan first   Where do you want to run to   What's the plan for food and shelter   It might be easier to work on changing the current things in your life than it is to run away   Is there any process to change subjects so that you're not stuck in Art  Yep thats exactly what im feeling right now  I really wouldnt care if i got hit by a bus or a car or contract something in my body at least id die naturally instead of taking the easier way out  im sorry you feel this way i really am but only you know yourself to the extent to know what to do next but i think the key would just be to change your perspective on everything a healthy mindset will lead you to a healthy life  i looks like you need personal advice so i would ask someone you care about such as a family member or the frined you mentioned before and have a real conversation with you where you can get this all out  I mean  I could ask him for an open relationship  We did it before  but we did it wrong  I think I could do better now  I don't think he wants to  but I could change his mind  I do have really serious feelings for him  We've been dating for years  I dunno why you're being down voted  The universe doesn't care about anyone  There is no god  Being deserving of something is not something that exists in nature  It's something people made up to comfort themselves  Same for much of the internet  especially forums and social media  In fact  the sheer amount of poor english in media like that could have a  detrimental  effect     However  some sites are written by highly literate people  or even professional writers  and in those cases I'd say it's a hell of a lot better than the former  But I think reading professional writers is ideal  as most of them will have a greater mastery of the language  and very often the material will be more challenging as well    Aside from the linguistic element  I think reading also helps with general cognition because it forces our brains into a more active and engaged kind of thinking  For example if I'm reading a novel  I'm trying to remember everything that happened previously  and how it relates to what I'm reading now  and I likely have to maintain this narrative over a course of days or weeks  depending on the length of the book   series   And certain non fiction subjects can also challenge the mind in a variety of other ways  of course    I definitely feel mentally sharper and more articulate when I'm reading more  generally speaking   That being said  there are also quite a lot of self help books on the market ranging from how to be a better conversationalist  to thinking faster on your feet  to creative thinking  which might also address some of the issues OP mentioned   Also  as far as verbal fluidity and articulation go    WRITING   can also help  Same idea as with the reading  Even just something like journaling could help with organizing your own thoughts and presenting them to others  Could be worth trying    So sorry for your loss   sending you a    hug     I have a Pug in my apartment too  The only time he ever barks is if he hears someone knock on the door  and that's only if he feels like it  He's an older Pug  about 12 or 13  and has arthritis in his back legs  so he hardly moves at all  He also loves my kids even though they can be a little rough  An absolute great family dog   The only downside is that he sheds EVERYWHERE  It gets all over my clothes  the furniture  the floor  even in places he's never been  The point is that i can convince them that i dont have the time to meet people  especially since most women are either shallow or taken   No problem mate  I was just making a joke  Cheers  You just entered high school and you hate it which is quite normal  I hated everything about it  I didn't have hardly any friends and was just living day to day always dreading the next and even contemplated suicide which was reported to the school  I got some help after that but I still hated everything  I eventually dropped out of high school due to unrelated reasons  and found a job which helped me get out of my shell a lot    Dropping out of high school while it did help me mature a bit and grow out of my shell has also limited my potential jobs  My advice  try to pick up a new hobby and just try to be more outgoing and talk to people  If you put forth the effort the others around you will too  A piece of advice a friend gave me and has helped me in getting out of my shell is this  "It's only awkward if you make it awkward " Don't worry about the small things in life it all passes    "Never give up  never surrender "   Galaxy Quest   Enjoy your success but remember that every advantage you had has helped you immensely  Remember that lots of people could have succeeded in your situation but could you succeed without those advantages  Could you succeed coming from a Broken home  no food  abusive parents  etc    Maybe you could  maybe not  but remember that before you decide what you have "earned"   At some point  you need to let things go   Practice does make perfect  but 99  of the time all you need is "good enough"   You might want to look into tips for handling perfectionism  because  as you've seen  wanting everything to be perfect makes everything harder  This is very normal  Talking everyday  you're going to run out of things to say  It's important to take breaks from talking to each other or seeing each other in order to do other things that you enjoy     r SuicideWatch  Seek out help  Don't let life get you down  Or drink   uber lyft taxi walk bike bus  Good on you for recognising and speaking to your husband that you need help  Shame he wasn't responsive  Remember that he is not a mental health professional who can assess what level of care you need with impartiality  Your husband may be concerned about practical child care arrangements  A hospital social worker may be able to assist with organising that    Some services offer mother child residential care    Consider getting a full time nanny after you are discharged    I wish you all the best  I'm so sorry  My health is failing because we can't afford health insurance or the treatment I need for a couple of chronic illnesses  I completely understand where you're coming from  I have been looking for work for three years but  the only interview I've been called for was a scam  Thanks for the tip  I'll check it out   This  sure you COULD run away  but that's not going to end as well as sticking it out Sad but true No over here in the UK you choose specific subjects to study  I chose Art as one of them because in thought I needed it but didn't  I hate my teacher because he believes I can do better but I can't   Running away seems better than what I'm stuck in right now  And no I don't have a plan but that's what i kinda enjoy  I want things to be spontaneous as they come and go  I plan to travel the world when I'm old enough  This is a government website What the fuck haha  This is so random  Nice of you to save this bird though  Hope everything goes well  wow    This hits close to home because I can some of myself in him  I have a relationship with a friend like this that    well I can be a genuine asshole  I dont intend to but it inevitably happens  Sigh  I'm sorry I dont have anything more to add other than thank you for the sobering self realization and I'm sorry  You seem self aware and mature enough that something way better should be down the road for you   You should tell him but whether or not you say when you got it is up to you  if it won't get traced you can try to link it on him  but it's definitely a good plan to tell him it exists  i could be looking into this too deep but im studying psychology and to me it looks like your psychological shadow  Jungian shadow  is developing feelings that your trying to repress  and ideally you should express these emotions  your not a bad gf your young and obviously not ready to be tied down yet nothing wrong with experimenting and learning about yourself by dating other guys   obviously dump your bf first  this may just be a sign that you like your bf but ultimate he is not the one for you   You're so young though  stick it out for a year more and see if it's all still the same Ask your GP about it again No matter the age of your siblings being there for them is also showing them that it is ok to grieve in whatever way is needed   If you can and want to be there for them don't forget to take time for yourself as well   Time to privately do and feel whatever it is you need   Pay attention to your needs  you can't be there for anyone else or help in the slightest if you don't   Trying too hard to choke it all down just makes it worse    I feel for you and am so very sorry   I lost both parents by the time I was 25  it sucks and is so painful   Remember we all grieve differently and it changes constantly   There is no right or wrong way  it's what you need  Do you have anyone who can help you with this   My advice would be to take it a little at a time   Get a friend who knows what you like and have them help you out of your comfort zone a bite at a time   If you like chicken nuggets  try a bite of chicken without the breading   If you like bread  try sourdough bread    Or something like that    If it helps  create a reward system for yourself   10 bites of new food gets you a bottle of nail polish  or something else small that you like  Do you smoke normally    Hopefully the plane itself isn't smoking  You can't make vague resolutions and expect them to work out well   Like  "be more social"  What does that mean    Make an  active  resolution  like  "The week of January 1 I'm going to join a meetup group online  The second week I'm going to sign up for one event  The third week I'm going to attend said event  The fourth week I'm going to sign up for another event  The fifth week I'm going to attend the event and talk to 2 people "  And so forth  Action not talk  Should be fine  but report back I did last year and nothing changed  Always told this bullshit lie  "Life gets better" when it simply doesn't for some  I see  I have tons of hobbies that have stopped giving me happiness and trust me I value myself I have had many chances to ruin my life with drugs but I haven't done it because I am the only one that can protect me but I feel paranoia because all my life I've had people who have made my life hell  I feel like a caveman who needs to be constantly on guard from attacks  am I being too nice to this person  Am I being used  Am I really living or am I just waiting to die   Feelsbad    SomeFantastic1  What does that green dot mean by your name  I guess making the assumption that you're gay is just the easiest to deal with       Maybe you should use it as an opening to share with her what is really making you unhappy in life   I have to say I agree  I don't want to die  but at the same time  I'm so damn tired of living  some days   When non existence is better than existence  it's perfectly logical to prefer death over life  I would undoubtedly choose the first option and although I'm not actively suicidal  I'm too big of a coward   I would not at all mind being dead so long as the manner of my death was rather quick and painless  My life is really nothing much to lose   I too used to love Rammstein as a teenager  I still listen to them from time to time  Have you heard the piano version of Mein Herz Brennt  It's great  Dude  you're fine  We have a friend that we've known since kindergarten  I'm 31 now  that mingled with all the different groups  If you said "Do you know John Jones " people would say yes  He was able to move from one group to another and be confident every time  He was friends with the jocks  nerds  geeks  different races  and then our small group of friends     It's not bad to be the guy on the outside  defintely taking this one to heart thank you Please don't  Message me and we can talk  I have felt the same way before and am so happy I didn't go through with it   Sorry for both of your losses  My dad died December 10th  Thinking of both of you  I call it pet glitter  I love my sons little mooch but she releases the love excessively  They are comfortable with roombas I have heard but we keep lint

anything you can take has complications and potential interactions   I guess an issue with herbals is the various extracts  But then again thats also a problem with generics   Ashwagandha is probably the best thing for you   https   examine com supplements ashwagandha   KSM 66 or sensoril are the standard extracts  most widely known to be effective  Potential side effects are minor and rare  The studies are done with the extracts  so if you don't get ksm66 or sensoril there isn't any hard evidence to back it up  However  even the whole root products like  this one  https   www amazon com

events  And do said plans together    That's a thing     I can't comprehend why one human would be this cruel to another  The memory is still so fresh and I've had nightmares about it since  I don't feel safe where I live  where I work  I'm always watching my back  Especially in rooms where we are off camera  He's just acting like nothing has happened and able to carry on with his life  all the while I'm scared to death   funny and sad at the same time   nbsp   well that just describes my life perfectly Thank you and I'm glad I could help   I told this friend a few months ago that I believe everyone we meet has a lesson to teach us   I appreciate the lessons he taught me and I wish he could remain a part of my life   But  as he would put it  I've got to follow the omens  and right now the omens seem to point to us parting ways  I know  I know  I live in a small town and the chances that we will see each other in the street aren't slim  If I can't find a new home I'm gonna have to leave the town altogether  Sounds like weird sex games dude  Unless you're into that sort of thing  I'd politely decline  You moved things with him beyond friendship and he clearly still has romantic feelings for you and thought you would be together  You left him for someone else  this isn't rocket science  He is never going to be your platonic friend again  he wants you to be his girlfriend  You don't want that so now you have to say goodbye   I hear ya  I just disagree  What you are doing is successfully changing the subject  you're not convincing people you are too busy to have a girlfriend  No one believes that  You're politely telling them it's none of their business  which is right   I've always found the most direct method is best  "Well you did throw up in Uber last night  I got knocked for the cleanup fee of  200 " It's not a lie you just have to be a little more patient  work towards always improving yourself and focus on being happy  It's one of the hardest things to do but incredibly worth it I struggle with depression and found that having my child changed the face of my depression in ways I never anticipated and made it hard for me to recognize my illness   I want you to know that your feelings do not make you a bad person or a bad mother   It doesn't mean you don't love your son   But that love isn't always enough to make the hell and torture of being a parent go away   Every parent I know has had moments where they struggled with patience and being the kind of parent they wanted to be   I found it incredibly isolating to feel like I was the only mother who wasn't enraptured and completely fulfilled by having a child  I reached out to friends but nobody was going through what I was   Getting professional help made all the difference  but going back to work helped too     If you ever need to talk  I'm here   Thank you for getting help    I think that's my problem  I'm too forgiving  even to those who don't deserve my forgiveness  I can't tell the police because it's the whole "he said  she said" case  and then X'll hunt me down for telling them  Limiting contact with him is best  If you feel he will start getting aggressive with your mum  again  I would recommend counseling  Especially for him  It seems like he may have some outstanding problems that need to be dealt with professionally  If you believe that at any time he may be physically aggressive with your mother  don't hesitate to take legal action  I know that you won't let anything too bad happen  Things appear to be looking up for you  I'm glad you have a plan  You've got this  Feel free to PM me if you have any questions or just want to talk vent   Everybody's different  that's all I can say   Some people just don't want other people around that much   Sounds like you are  intensely  around people on your job  so it makes sense you'd need to be alone otherwise     If you changed to a less stressful job  things might change  Or they might not   Mothers ask the gay question because that's what they know how to do  and because the media tells them to     If I had any advice worth taking  it might be just to figure out what you want in life    what would actually make you happy   If you need help to do that  many do  especially since you don't have friends to bounce things off   If you wanted to change your life  I would make this your first priority because only then would you understand what you actually wanted to do change    Human baby cries are designed to trigger   moms   parents to want to fix it    Believe me  works on dads too   She is not at all ugly and three years older than me  I would love to fulfill her fantasy with full secrecy and no male on male contact  but I know what you mean  I'm going to go to my management tomorrow and explain what has happened and if nothing comes of it  quit  Ok thank you  should I book another appointment or is there a simpler way   I lost my father in a similar way when i was 17  ventricular arrythmia as he was working out at the gym at 54  He was also my absolute best friend in the world  and that is irreplaceable  I still have moments when i cry to this day  12 years later  It gets easier  but it's never really gone  And at this point I'm glad it isn't  because it reminds me how much that love meant to me  and still does  I'm sorry you had him taken from you so early and unexpectedly  and it's an experience I'd never wish on anyone  But I'm still so blessed and happy I had him as a father  even though it felt like such a short time to have had him  Hang in there  and do what you need to to grieve  as other people said  And don't stuff away your love for him because it feels easier to bear the loss  because that love will comfort you for the rest of your life  that much i can promise you  Hang in there  and I'm sure I'll think of you often in the coming year   feel free to pm me anytime  and i truly mean that  Take care  and God bless you and your family  have you tried talking about it to admissions counselors elsewhere  If you explain your gpa it will probably actually give you a boost in admissions because it shows that you're still determined to stay in academia and give your best even when the going gets tough  As someone who has been lied to by a significant other and found out the truth afterwards  my stance on this is that the lie is definitely the worst part  Because he was afraid of what I might think or do  he chose not to tell me what was going on  By withholding the truth  he tried to control what information I had access to  and by extension  he tried to control my feelings and reactions  That right is mine alone  and your girlfriend's  If you have honour and self respect  as well as respect for her  you'll tell the truth  and let her make her own decision on how to respond   I'm 33 and live in Minneapolis I'll never forget the time a "normie" friend of mine tell me he purposely stopped hanging out with a group of his friends because they were too "weird" and "clingy" for him    nbsp   Some people can just be so selfish  They fail to realize just how important something may be worth simply because they have it  It doesn't really matter in this case  you guys aren't friends  you were more because you had sex  He obviously still at least wants to have sex with you and that will put a strain on your current relationship  It'll be best to cut all ties if you want to continue it  He's trying to make you feel jealous    Yeah I bought a journal today as a sort of all purpose note taker  that's a good place to start  Yeah you should poop  I'd also assume  just like any other bandage  that it should be changed regularly  Call your doctor's office asap and see what they say  They may have missed going over some after care instructions with you  Thanks for the advice  and happy new year too     I don't think you should be comparing yourself to others  I know that's really hard and that's kind of how society is built  but just become someone's "better" doesn't mean that you're lesser than them  So long as you're doing the best you can  I think you'll see some changes   Doing the best you can doesn't mean what you're doing right now  You have the ability to finish your homework on time and you have the ability to talk to someone  like a teacher  I'm not saying you have to study 24 7  but you can certainly at least finish your homework  Successful people don't necessarily have high IQs  but rather know how and when to ask for help and know how to persevere  She needs therapy like yesterday   and jesus too """""Looks don't matter """""   nbsp   Added quotations to emphasize just how stupid and untrue this is  Man I don't even have 3 friends  Honestly to me  it sounds a little ridiculous but I guess as long as you can convince your family and friends to go along with it  go for it  www Meetup com Try and get close to the person you know who you like the most from those that you know   They'll naturally introduce you into their friend group over time  from my perspective a hobby is something that you enjoy and do in your free time which is why it's probably impossible for someone to give you them as the experience is different  However if your asking for generic ones that would normally fit the bill for guys is maybe Sport  gaming  comics anime  popular movies tv shows  travel of course these are just off the top of my head and most of these may not apply depending on your age range and background Good luck on the path to self improvement     ugh thats creepy tbh From what you describe  it seems pretty emotionally complicated and volatile  If you do decide to play along  expect all of that drama you've been witnessing in his life over the years to infect your own life  To keep on pushing myself to get that college degree    nbsp   If I'm going to be FA  I'd much rather be FA and financially successful  So emailing the admissions people at other schools  I have sent two out but haven't gotten replies yet  but it is the weekend so maybe they just haven't gotten to it yet  I'll continue doing that  and yeah I've explained my situation and expressed my desire to continue my education post cancer  Telephone and see  They are the only ones who can get you a referral  Did he get invited to parties and other stuff  I don't  As the son of a hoarder  I agree with this statement  I wish someone stepped in earlier  I still can't shake the doorbell dread   That made me sad  Not for you but the fact that I can relate     I'd go with the second option    nbsp   Not finding a SO is incredibly painful  but there are other things that I want in life too  Oh  and thankfully they can be bought with money  not good looks  It pays to be a materialistic person  she wants you bro but if your sick of the emotional rollercoaster I would avoid tell her you want to be friends and move on of course if you think she still worth a try then go get em    Regarding Roombas   Never  ever use them if there's possibly a shit on the floor at the same time  I don't really know if I would have done anything 10 minutes later  but I guess we'll never know now  I don't want to make excuses  it's just that I was with my friends and watching fireworks etc  and she didn't give me much of a chance  I can imagine everything you said could be how she's feeling  I'm sure it is actually  Well  thanks for your input  I appreciate it  All pedantry aside  this is what we refer to as a "metaphor " Of course the brain is not literally a muscle  but many have likened it to a muscle  which can be developed through use and repetition  In this way  the two are analogous  even though the mechanisms are quite different    Unless of course you were just joking  in which case  lol I'll wish he was dead for you   What a terrible thing to live with   I am so sorry you have to deal with that  I don't think she'll be creeped out  probably flattered  Also  depending on her tastes  I don't know how much you know about her  she might like mushy lovey dovey stuff or really hate it  Personally  I hate it   If you're delivering a card don't you have to see her face to face anyway  I think the best plan of action is to say what you want to say to her in person and give her the card with the song lyrics  As for the song itself  Bruno Mars  Idk I have zero knowledge about good songs these days  You have an "out of your league" hot wife who is obsessed with your penis  That definitely isn't a loser in my book  Just a dude in a shitty toxic situation  I don't know if this helps but shows like criminal minds and Lie To Me are good at showing body language and explaining it especially Lie To Me It sure is complicated  I feel like I don't want anything of that sort with my girlfriend and personal life  I definitely enjoy the fantasy but always get an anxiety attack when I am close to it  I would never do it with my girlfriend because she is not into it and I would never force it upon her   Well  sometimes you just gotta tell them that you feel that they're toxic to you and you don't want to be around them  That would be simplest  albeit dramatic  method  If they're known to be assholes by everyone then the only one who'll think you're the asshole in the situation is them   If you want to skirt around it  just gradually stop hanging out with them  Don't make up lies  tell them valid reasons to not hang out  Try to avoid them so that you just naturally fall apart  Try to make new friends too  Hi    I want to start of by saying that students shouldn't be compared  Just as different people have different learning methods  different students have different rhythms  And just because you're taking more time in this phase does not mean you're less smarter or that you'll forever have a slower rhythm    Here's a few things that can help you     Find your learning method  be it listening to people explain  making summaries  reading a lot of times  etc  just find something that helps you   Use little trick to memorize things  most subjects you should aim to understand but let's be realistic there's always something that's outright memory  For me mnemonics work really well especially stupid ones  Really they don't have to make that much of a sense as long as that somehow stays with you   Ask for more activities  it shows your dedication and it would get you better prepared for finals    Talk to teachers or other students   if you're struggling with a subject just ask your friends or your teachers  Nobody minds giving you some help and it's better than studying everything from scratch by yourself  Most importantly  have confidence in yourself  Despite everything in your life  you've made it through  this is just one more year  And if for some reason you do end up a super senior  Own it  don't let labels put you off  There's nothing to be ashamed of  Just as friend D is now doing well  you wil also be better in the future   Wish you the best   It's your body  you can do what you want   I don't have any chest hair  but I do have armpit hair   Like all the men in my family  I do absolutely nothing with my armpit hair  And that was the last we heard from  u GonnaLiveTo120 Get new friends  That is horrific  I'm so sorry that happened to you  Please know you are not alone  Find a therapist  they are equipped to help you through it  and are confidential  If you need to just chat  you can pm me    I'll admit  I maintain a personal fb page    No matter what I say  usually to wish people happy holidays  post a funny picture  no one but my aunt acknowledges me    My fb friends are high school friends who haven't known me for ten years but they all follow the pages of a handful of people who post inane quotes and the same shit  really    Same with twitter  different audience  but similarly  people I've known for years  No one to talk to  I tweet the same jokes  commentary  and retweets everyone else does     if people don't care about you  it doesn't matter what effort you make  But I know hey see  Once in a while this horrible girl that I follow subtweets to me insult me   I feel like a lot of people are suggesting ways to absorb more information such as reading  movies  etc  but to me it sounds like you are an intelligent person who knows a lot already but just doesn't know how to express themselves  I would put myself in the same category  which is why I'm in this subreddit   and one thing that helps me is writing my different musings in a journal  This gives me a chance to sort of practice ordering my thoughts about a particular matter before I have to speak them out loud to someone else  Wow you are one lucky bastard  But yea  it's the first offense thing that probably spared you  My first offense was a felony  but the fact that it was my first and I was 14 helped when it came to the plea deal  It will always be visible to courts but I don't have to report it when I apply for jobs and I can still vote  But yea  it's still ridiculous that we criminalize pot  I'm glad you're doing okay though  I'm sorry    Did you go at all    Good parents let their kids enjoy their peers a little   I truly believe that  It's humiliating being at that age and having to explain your parents won't let you enjoy that time of your life   Even in a strict culture  It's humiliating   A library card is free   Is that some shitty sex advice  Rejection is an unfortunate but normal part of life  Maybe you're just not his type   Kinda hesitant to join  4 of my best friends have all joined  and all in different branches and are absolutely MISERABLE right now     err  hey dude I'm not sure how you came to think I would play drums with you on open mic night but I don't feel comfortable doing that  I'm happy for you that you're giving this a go and I can come to support you but I do not want to be part of the performance   Contact the press if the company doesn't do anything  Other victims may see it and speak up too  "Thank you for being willing to share your struggle with me  How can I help you with it  I'm here to listen to whatever you have on your mind"  I know  he kinda lead me on so I get that part of it  I just feel like I should have been smarter than that and seen that before I asked him     Host your own parties  A party doesn't have to be 50 people with alcohol  weed  and or girls  Those movies that have a ton of people where the cops show up and everyone runs away aren't real  Besides the parties I went to would eventually end up with two douchebags outside in a fight   The parties don't matter in the long run  My older brother gave me some really good advice right before I graduated from highschool  in the end you're only going to end up with two or three really good friends  It's the truth  When you get older you're going to realize this bullshit truly didn't matter  I know it's not what you want to hear  I'm sure you've heard it already  and I remember the feeling that you're probably feeling right now  The feeling I'm talking about is the feeling that it doesn't matter what you will think in the future  everything that's every going to be important in your life is only ever going to happen now  BULLSHIT   I can promise you buddy that you're going to end up with one or two really good friends  The guys you think you'll be friends with forever won't be the one or two  I have a friend I've known since first grade  we're like brothers  but over the years we've grown apart  we have different ideas and ambitions  My best friend right now  I basically acted like a teenage girl when we were in highschool  he should not have stayed friends with me  But I know he and I would take a bullet for one another  I know if I called him right now and told him I needed help he'd do it   Focus on being the best type of friend a guy would want and stop trying to mold yourself into what they want   I really want to reach through this phone and give you a hug and tell you to slow the fuck down and not give too many shits about what other people think about you   Know that 90 percent of all men in America know how you feel  and have had it happen to us    It is never easy to put yourself out there  and you'll always wonder "what's wrong with you" when things don't work out   But the point is that you'll never know what's going on inside another person's head in these situations   It may have nothing to do with you or how worthy you are   Be nice to him in the future  but keep making new friends and keep seeing where the road takes you   I would encourage you to keep taking the initiative whenever you think it's what you want to do     But they have been broken up for like 6 years  Unfortunately it happens to us all  I was turned down by this girl I was getting close with  You just pick up your things  figuratively  and move on  Thanks  I appreciate it  I admit  in some ways I think I actually am picky considering my position  not that I really get options anyway    I went through a phase in my late teens where I told myself I didn't really care what the guy looked like or whatever  as long as we could get along and actually liked the idea of dating a guy with mental illness or something  since I had a problem with this myself and found it really interesting   It didn't really work  I got to know'ish two guys from a mental health support forum I used to frequent  one wasn't bad looking but had schizophrenia and used to send me big long conspiracy theory filled messages on fb and I kinda picked up he had really bad anger issues  he got banned from the mental health forum for threatening mods   I got along with another guy who was friendly but clingy  I'm fat so I didn't mind when he said he was fat  but he sent me a picture of himself and he was absolutely huge  he said he was 27st  just under 400 lbs    I had no attraction to him whatsoever  it ended up fizzling out  Neither were exactly immediate dating prospects or asked me out or anything  though    I'm not suggesting I'm holding out for some male model or whatever  but I do like somewhat conventionally attractive guys who are of average weight or buff  being fat I know that's hypocritical   have very caring and protective personalities  and share some of my interests  indeed I'd love an 'average' looking man with these qualities  I would still date a man with mental illness too  I don't actually care about things like money  I wouldn't care if he was on the dole  Mostly I'd just want a guy who could carry a conversation with me at my pace     One of the things is that since I've never dated I've kind of just always fantasized  I don't have the experience or any real idea of what guy would be good for me  I have a fake account on POF and I do just like to window shop at unattainable guys  But I wouldn't want my mirror opposite in male form   I'm used to being single and have decided it's better to just stay single than attempt to 'settle' for the next thing that has a dick who is also attempting to settle  because I couldn't stand  a  being resented and  b  feeling resentful myself  It's just as well I don't get offers and won't unless maybe  and it's a big if  I massively improve myself    I'm so sorry for your loss  I understand how you feel  as the day my Father passed away was the hardest day of my life  Well i dont tell people that so i got that covered  I agree though  A parent needs to understand that a social life is important for development as well  Doing well in school and not getting into legal trouble isnt the only goal for a young person    My mother will always bug me for not knowing how to dance but dancing doesn't happen at home  it happens in parties  Either way the damage is done  Hopefully my mom isn't one of those annoying mothers that wonder why im single  He was actually as responsive as I needed him to be  I addressed this in another comment earlier today  I am appreciative of your concern  suggestions and support   Yes  HRT basically does everything except give you a vagina and reverse bone structure changes  Edit  and doesnt change your voice He aviods me now and I won't see him as much  but he might tell everyone  He was the first guy I asked in a while but I don't want to be labeled as desperate or anything or a psycho  We work together in a medium sized place  I feel or all the guys in the world now  what a shitty feeling  I'll be nice to him when I see him it'll just be awkward   Because nothing changes and we stay jaded    Try the honey version   Interested in any advice here  I'm in somewhat the same boat as OP  It's sabotaging my efforts to fix my longtime relationship ruined by my depression bipolar  Thank you I wish you all the strength and support for your fight   He sounds pretty selfish IMHO  been there    I would talk to him about how it made you feel and how he should reciprocate and not be such an asshole  Or he'll lose his bj privileges  or you'll find someone better or something  Even if you enjoy giving head  eventually you'll get tired of just getting ignored and basically feeling used   At school during any downtime like in the morning or at lunch I just sit somewhere and stare at people and want to die  I should probably stop    I'm so happy to hear you are doing better for yourself and I thank you for your support and listening ears   I have one  It's just too far for me to go to hangout everyday  I forgot to mention we both share a car too    You can either spend a few more years and let it grow to 100  million or just sell it now  A middle class commoner making  50grand per year makes just under  3million when retirement is reached  Most of the people reading this will not even make close to that in a lifetime         You'd have ten times that amount if you cashed out now and got a normal job or passion to occupy your time  Having money does not mean you have to live extravagantly either  I love how Socrates put it       Contentment is natural wealth  Luxury is artificial poverty    akemashite omedeto gozaimasu  to you too my dude    Where in Japan are you living  I'd like to live somewhere in Asia for a few years  past experience has taught me how much fun it is to be be immersed in a completely foreign culture  having to deal with the accompanying challenges all alone   I'm 17 too and I can't imagine being competent enough at anything to tutor little kids so uh  good job I guess  Why do you think you have no friends  Thanks I appreciate this  I live in a not so welcoming town and have made various decisions based off what I think people would think of me  While I know this isn't the right way to live I can't just ignore the community I live in  I just want to have a group of friends  I'm sure I won't talk to them in the long run but how can I just ignore this feeling right now  I think your right   He should eat it  where do you go to parties like this  The ones I've been in usually have very very few girls without partners if any ever  and usually have dozens of single guys racing each other to swoop in on whatever girl that's not being attended to  I've never been approached by girl  Like ever  And I've been to quite a few parties  I'm sorry you had to go through this  The best thing you can do is forgive and move on  In the end  forgiveness isn't about them  it's about you  You'll be able to be at peace and not hold so much pain anger hatred in your heart  You'll be able to be happy and have a more fulfilling life w o the negativity you feel now   Do you work  The "You don't have to look far to see how well you have it" quote definitely applies here  Damn dude  I'm sorry you had to go through all of that Yup  that's why I only speak 2nd hand on dog ownership and Roombas  And      this is going to sound really callous but youre obviously not over him  Its ok  Maybe you need more time  Maybe you need to let go    but time and a concerted effort should help  You cant save everyone no matter how nice they are  take care of you  enjoy your time with the new guy  if you dont youre going to lose him and end up with nothing   I think it sounds like a good solution to an annoying problem   It's not like you chose to have your birthday on NYE   If I were you  though  I'd throw yourself a "delayed" or "belated" birthday party  it sounds less ridiculous   And then when somebody asks when your actual birthday is  you can explain the whole thing  Yeah a lot   Aw thanks    What do you mean I pulled    They remain sealed to this day  The Times reviewed thousands of pages of them   If items are under seal  how is that The Los Angeles Times was able to review them  Don't feel guilty  I'm sure you helped your ex as much as you could during the time you were together  If he doesn't want to help himself  you're only going to be hurting because you feel powerless  I was in a similar situation and had to walk away because in the end I was destroying myself trying to fix him   This is a very good post  One thing I've noticed  off topic  is that single dads are praised more than single moms  I'm not talking for the whole world just my area and experience  Its odd how people treat others in specific circumstances but I highly agree this all needs to change kids or no kids  single or taken etc  Add an extra 200 Calories  a day of clean and lean food baked chicken breast  grilled fish  Thanks so much that is great advice and I do like him  only problem is I'm 15 and not allowed to date     But hopefully soon I can do this    But how are you 100  sure  What did he do to make you so sure  Have a good day too  Hell Yeah   That sounds really heavy   I'm sorry you've had a pretty rough time so far   Is there anything in particular that you can think of which would help things improve to start out the new year  man fuck that wedding I appreciate that  and I'll give that a go  Thank you so much for your help  It's been incredibly useful and Ihope that we can sort this out soon  Thank you both    it worked out well  One of my family members was like is "she going to come over after the movie " And someone else said that's up to me  and that's what I politely declined  Your advice helped a lot      Keep going  Keep fighting  Don't give up    Hugs   Dumb question  do they have program or career advisers at your school who can help out   Maybe even suggest options for you  email her the link to the video using an anonymous email client like https   www guerrillamail com  Caloric surplus  eat more calories than you are burning  Make sure you are tracking your macros  fats  carbs  protein   Eat things such as pasta  potatoes  breads  fruits  high in carbs   Peanuts  peanut butter  olive oil  avacados  high in fats   Chicken  turkey  lean beef  eggs  nonfat Greek yogurt  high in protein  Nothing is going to change in a relationship like this  It sounds like he does not even value you  Best of luck on what comes next in the relationship Ah  Also just noticed I engrished again    Your post is very touching and heartbreaking and I'm really impressed by you  Even if you feel helpless or guilty or a million different things  what I took away is that your are brave and loving  Whatever kind of help you seek  you are showing strength just by asking for it   I understand this feeling  I recently asked my classmate to hangout and I never heard from him after he personally asked me for my number  I felt embarrassed for every thing I did to get his attention  until a few days ago when I realized that I was just doing what I wanted  So  don't ever feel embarrassed for doing something that you want  All you wanted was to create a bond with him  and it simply didn't work out  You should feel proud that you were able to put yourself on the line and voice how you felt  It takes a lot for someone to ask someone else out  It shows that you're confident  willing  and have enough courage  Use that same drive to accept that he's not interested  It happens to every single person on planet Earth   If you have a rewards card for your local grocery stores you can usually go online to their website and add relevant coupons to your card account every few weeks  It's easy to do and no clipping or giant binders  The more you elaborate  the more I get the sense that you're comfortable with where you are with this  which I wasn't as sure of from your first post  I'm pleased to see that that's the case  I suppose I was coming from a place where  when I first started discovering my own "interests " I wavered with a lot of guilt and friction over how to compartmentalize it  It took me way too long to figure out that guilt is the entirely wrong way to frame the reaction to your own identity  Again  I can understand the need to be reserved about saying certain things  though  and frankly  I still have mostly that same disposition towards my own kinks  Some of them manifest gradually as I come to trust a relationship  but others might never  The shame element of that decision is no longer an issue  though  which I'm happy to say   In any case  I'm glad it helped to ventilate it  Here's to solidarity and lightening our own baggage loads where we can  The first two is pretty much my 2016 too  You're reading this right  Awesome  Is there a way you can read this while listening to a song on youtube   If so  awesome  If not  don't trouble yourself with it  it is perfectly alright  my friend  Though I think this song will help inspire you while you read this  Please listen to it regardless as I think what you need is motivation  https   youtu be D7hm1gI17e0  Firstly  listen to  u FMP11 's advice  They know their stuff and I can vouch for them  My friend  I know life beats you down and you just want to surrender this time around to just maybe try again at a later time  but now is the time  Trust me on this  You CAN do this  and you know it  Sit down the controller  put on some tunes in a headset  and hit the books  Nothing comes easy  This is true  Don't let the titles others put on you limit the person you are meant to be  Autistic  stupid  loser  purple  Please excuse my language as I don't mean to offend  but fuck purple  This is YOUR life  not theirs  We all have our demons who degrade us with every step we take  but we can't let them hold us down forever  Grab the reins and take what's been yours from the very beginning  This is your life  and you can make a difference  no matter what the demons in the back of our heads say to us  You are greater than your faults  Cause trust me  we all have them  but don't let the fault rule or you'll never make it through  Let your passion burn you even when it's not easy  Don't be smothered by the weight of life's problems  They'll always be there  but you will overcome in your perseverance  I have faith in you  brother  Get up  You got this  And after you conquer school  and stand at the door to what comes after  don't despair  even if you start out at a very basic job  Pick up a skill you enjoy  even if you're absolutely terrible at it  Trust me on this one  My dream of writing was crushed by a teacher when I was a child  and it wasn't till over a decade later that I finally told those demons in my head that I won't be bound by them anymore  I've been writing for a couple years now  I haven't made a career out of it just yet  but I have gotten better at saying what needs to be said  That is the basis for all writing  along with the complex world I've built by having a child like wonder  No matter what anyone tells me  I know now that I am a writer  even if no one else acknowledges me as such  So my friend  take heart and don't despair  Take up an art you enjoy and keep working at it  You only ever get better with continued perseverance  Just like your schooling  You can do this  Have faith  and get up      I had a friend I was semi close with not come to my wedding  and ten years later it still makes me a bit sad to think about it   It's one night that will be remembered for the rest of her life  do you want her  thinking  "I thought me and  r wildflowermural were friends  why didn't she come to my wedding " For decades to come   Wasn't smoking  but clearly dropping heat  Take from someone who tried and failed a couple of years ago  Don't   Sometimes I'll joke around and make suicide jokes  but in this case I'm gonna be serious   It's alright if you aren't the most popular guy around  It's alright if no girl likes you    I know this sounds harsh but bear with me  My solution was to find people that made me happy  People whom I shared interests with  For example  the people I hang out with on Teamspeak  or play dungeons and dragons  or Warhammer 40k with   Collage is a new world with likely more people  You'll find people  at least one  that likes you  I promise it   I know you've probably heard this before  but it does get better   I'm sorry you're going through this  I'm sorry this happened  Please get tested in case that asshole had something  I echo the sentiments above about therapy    I'm here if you need someone to talk to   If it's leg is hurt  maybe taping a toothpick snap off ends to blunt them  or matchstick to it will help its leg set heal  We did this to a rat once and it helped     I hate to say it but it sounds like your parents let him get away with too much  I mean why wouldn't he be an asshole if he can just totally get away with it and your parents will still do whatever he wants  No one has forced him to grow up and now he's 28 and acting like a 7 year old who hasn't realized he isn't the center of the universe yet  and takes his family relationships for granted  I don't know how to fix that  but I bet he is projecting some harbored resentment towards the family since he had to rely on other people for a while  You are NOT a failure  the first year of motherhood can be wonderful and it can also be absolute  hell    Tesla   Age of the kid  A 4 year old is going to be very different than a 14 year old You should go for it   Yes I have a full time job  still find myself being bored after I get out of work though  I have about 6 hours to spare before I go to sleep every night and I don't work weekends   That's the thing though  You have three friends  Many people here have none and have never had any  Sounds like you have anxiety   If you couldn't walk  because of a shattered leg bone  would you feel like a failure  or call for help   I've been right there where you are  And  I want you where I am  now  Three teens and i have grey hair     So two things  You realize that geting yourself help is actually helping your child  and have your child checked for problems that might be causing the cry fits    I had three babies  in diapers  at  the same time  Sometimes  I would baby proof the room  lock them in with me  and put on cartoons  while they played and I laid on the bed sobbing   I eventually got help    I hated being a zombie  Told my dr and we slowly found a dosage that was a happy medium  At my darkest  I always focused on the baby's safety   Please know that you are NOT alone  you are NOT a failure   I have two little girls and I've always told them that they can date whoever they want and love whoever they want  I sincerely hope it's a complete non issue  societally  by the time they're teenagers  We're getting there  slowly  but we are  I'm incredibly proud of you  I'm not happy to hear about the sad things that happened to you  but you've clearly been very brave and awesome this year  Congratulations  Today has been pretty decent   I'm spending the night with my sister and her boyfriend   We went to Olive Garden for lunch dinner then saw a movie   It was called Fences   I wasn't a fan but my parents and sister liked it   My sister  her boyfriend and I went and got ice cream at some place downtown  I was a little disappointed that the only lactose free flavor they had was vanilla  but I got it anyway because I didn't have any lactaid with me  and then we had cocktails at a rooftop bar   I swear this one I had was amazing   It was some martini with lavender and rhubarb flavors that felt very fancy   Now we're back at her boyfriend's place drinking wine and watching Finding Dory on Netflix   I'm hungry but I feel bad about eating his food   I wish I could order a pizza or something   Gotcha  Well  you could always make like a weekly trip to the biblio and get 5 or 6 books to last you until the next week  You could set a goal  like reading all the Booker prize winners  or a book from everyone who won a Nobel prize   This is always my reaction to this type of post  I've never been asked this by friends or relatives  In fact  the few times I've made hypothetical references to situations 'if I ever were to get married'  others look very uncomfortable  and look away or at the floor  or just laugh nervously  Go and then have a bath afterward  Many people before you have had this kind of surgery  So this is not new to the medical staff   The key to a fast recovery is keeping it clean   And not eating anything spicy Except we're not socialized to believe it  It's something that's been ingrained in us for thousands of years  There's very few spieces that need social and romantic interactions in order to have a fulfilled life and we happen to be one of them  Damn son  You're in 10th grade  Cut yourself some slack  Everyone hates high school  Just bare your teeth and get through it  When it's over you'll be saying  "damn high school was fast " When I was in high school I spent my time with a small handful of friends because I trusted them  I thought the norm of having a bunch of friends was bullshit  Most teens are backstabbing assholes anyway  Your friend has separate interests which is normal  Can still be friends no problem  I like computers  yet my buddy  who I've been friends with for 10  years  loves to lift  We're still friends to this day  Bonded stronger than anything in this world  I'm 22 with a steady job  a kid and a wife  I still have no clue what I want to do with the rest of my life  I don't think anyone really knows because life is too unpredictable  But i'll go back to the fact that your only 14  Go easy on yourself and just focus on school  Get it over with it and get a job and make mad money  Buy yourself your own gym  Just work hard  Good luck buddy  I get it every year   You're not alone  I absolutely dread New Year's Eve Day   Personally I think it is part melancholy sadness over bad things in the past year  and anxiety about the coming year   Also I think that staying up until midnight and watching the ball drop when I was young coupled with all the noise afterwards gave me a bad taste in my mouth and maybe even slight trauma   I usually just focus on getting through the two day span  try not to watch too much news and just think about getting back into the regular routine afterwards  I hope this is helpful   Somebody  in some way  gave them to the LA Times     I don't know anyone who became close friends with someone after high school  college  they just become too busy with family and work and don't give a fuck about you I was going to suggest this too    And to see a doctor because I don't think the pain you're describing is normal  even for very frequent self love  You're welcome for the advice   I'm female  though   Well  are you just introverted or do you want friends   I'll be your friend  you can message me whenever you want   It sometimes makes me feel bad for a little bit  when it happens  but I prefer that instead of sexual harassment   I just think they must be projecting their own insecurities onto me because I really don't see the point in telling me I'm ugly like I'm unaware of it   It really is quite pointless  when you think about it that way  so I try not to waste my time ruminating about it   What have they mocked you about   Maybe they are just jealous   I don't want to hijack your thread but I'm going to do one of these soon  In many states  you can report an unsafe driver to the DMV  Department of Motor Vehicles  and they'll ask the person to come in and be retested  Here's the link for California   https   www dmv ca gov portal dmv  1dmy urile wcm path  dmv

is  Cost around  20 000 Yes  Some people are bullies  and they dont like it when they arent in control  Also  dont forget that some people enter into situations expecting an argument  so its about learning to differentiate between the naturally hostile person  and the angry person expecting you to be a dick  From there you can choose an appropriate response    All kids that age think their parents at mean half the time  it comes with the job   Just be there to support her  share stories of when the kids said things like that to you as well   As long as she knows you love and care about her and her feelings  its going to be the biggest difference in the world   A starting point is to just go outside and spend some time in the outdoors  It has wonderful effects on your mental health  while the walking is great light cardio  Plus  you feel a sense of accomplishment afterwards  especially if you find someone you can share the experience with    Of course  that's easier said than done  but it was vital in my recovery from a depressive episode this past summer    Hope 2017 holds positive change for you yo Thank you  Call the cops  If needed  Victim services  or what ever they're called  can help find a place to stay once charges are pressed  I'm sure the Red Cross or even other city services exist to help in situations like this  You don't need to wait to find a job  you need to deal with this asshole now  Thank you Thank you for the encouragement and support  Im 18 and in college now  I see all my high school friends parting ways and I feel the same way  I think about all that every night but tbh  its not like youre alone  everyone you know is growing up with you and you still feel youthful all the way up to your 40s so you still have a long way to go  just dont think about it      Don't like it here  Than leave  I'm pretty sure 90  of the people here know this  It's hard to leave though   Commenting here is practically the only human interaction I get all day  I think I'd go insane without this place  That  and it's nice talking to people who understand  even if most of the talking revolves around self pity and bitterness   I'd have suggested taking out a small loan and paying back asap to help maintain your job  but with bad credit  that might be hard  Give it a shot anyway  but know you cannot be hesitant to pay it back if you do get it    If you're currently living alone  I'd suggest finding a roommate and negotiate something with them  If not that  then find someone you can roommate with and  again  negotiate  Just make sure it's not dangerous   Living with someone can drastically cut your bills  but you'll have to work hard and put in all the effort you can to show keep the job and start improving from there    I also suggest taking a visit to r personalfinance as they can provide more detailed advice than I   I think that's the exact name of the subreddit   It sounds like you're struggling to stay afloat and you're doing whatever you can do survive  If you aren't  and you are slacking even a little bit  you need to step up and put in all the hard work you can to make sure you don't collapse under this cumbersome weight   You must keep this up  It requires a lot of self sacrifice but it is imperative that you do so  If you only have one job  and a lot of time still  find a second job  Get enough of an income to get you on your feet  Then start taking care of yourself  You need to stay healthy in order to keep working  Not only for that  but also to improve your mood and happiness in general    I'm not sure how much you've tried  but give talking to your parents another shot  Try to be a bit assertive and show how much you care to improve  Negotiate with them if you can  Maybe say something like "Parents  I need some help  I know you don't want to lend me a hand  but I need it to prevent myself from falling to the ground  None of us desired life to twist this way  but right now I'm asking you to help me twist it back  Have faith in me this one final time  And if i fail  " or something the lines of that    I'd give more future but right now you need help for the immediate future    I don't know what else to advice besides just saying that you need to work as hard as you can to survive  As bad as this is  you have fear of a worse future to push you  and a desire for a better future for a pull    If you need someone to talk to  I'm here  I could maybe provide more advice or guidance   or just friendship  with more time  Just stay strong  keep putting in all the effort you can  dont be afraid to negotiate  and don't give up   I'm sorry to hear all that bad happened to you  And though I wish you a better future  it's up to you to make it better    Good luck  and be safe  Want to sound like an intelligent person  Then strive to be able to express complex ideas with the simpliest words  not the other way around as many try  Turn the TV on  Listen to music  Read some comics  Play some videogames  Just do your own thing   Call one of those buddies up and ask if they want to come over for videogames and watch some Rick and Morty  That's a great idea  thanks ill definitely do that   None  Your 15 and having these thoughts  Just know everyone deals with something  EVERYONE  Now listen here  get some perspective  always do whats best for you if you can but realize not everything is going to go your way  You said you like to explore yourself  Well do it more  find what lights your fire and what makes you happy  you do not need anyone to make you happy be glad of the time you spend alone and make the most of it  Work out  write in a journal  dont depend ln drugs  kiss a pretty girl  find new friends  be passtionate  do you  and most importantly do not give a fuck what anyone thinks  The best time to plant a tree is 10 years ago  second best time is now  Stop being a bitch  be the greatest you you can be  and believe in yourself  Ignore the bottom dwellers on Red Pill  They're a minority and their opinion doesn't reflect how the majority of society thinks  There's a reason why so many people ridicule look down on them  Besides  men with such shallow notions of attractiveness aren't the kind of guys you want to have chasing after you anyway    First of all  you can do little things to help slow the aging process  For instance  I wear sunscreen all year round  damaging UV rays are present even in winter   moisturise 2x day and don't smoke  I also use prescription skin creams  get regular exercise  eat healthily and try to get enough sleep  I put more effort into this stuff than most people I know  but I recognise that this is the only body that I get  so I want to take care of it and get the most mileage possible      Ultimately though  we're all going to age  This is where you have to work on acceptance  and on finding value within yourself regardless of your youth and appearance  I've experienced the same insecurity you describe at various times over the years  In hindsight  20yr old me was a baby  and while I didn't realise it at the time  I still had so much to learn and so much growth personal development to go through  I expect that this will continue with time    I'm 28 now and while I still sometimes worry about physical aging  it's becoming less important as time goes on  I'm grateful for the knowledge that the years have given me and I can definitely say that I like myself  and feel happier and more confident within myself now than I did at 20  I'm actually really excited for my 30s and 40s  and I feel that whatever wrinkles I gain will be worth it for the wisdom and experience that comes along with them  If someone offered to turn me back into my 20 year old self  I'd absolutely say no   Try to invest in other aspects of yourself  I think the people who struggle the most with ageing are those who don't have a strong sense of self worth or accomplishment beyond their physical appearance  Your value and what makes you attractive to others involves so much more than just your looks  Get an education  take up hobbies  read books  travel   engage in fulfilling activities that connect you with something outside of yourself    Aside from this  I've had friends who died  through either deliberate or accidental causes  before their 25th birthdays  Sometimes I think of them and I'm reminded of the fact that they will never age and will sadly miss out on all the wonderful and exciting things life has to offer  Aging is a privilege that so many are denied  Some people are struck with terminal illness in their childhood or teens  Whenever I start to feel anxious about growing older  I try to remind myself that aging means that I've had the opportunity to live    Also  the whole "over the hill" "not attractive after 25" thing is nonsense IME  I'm 28 and have absolutely no trouble finding men who want to date and or hook up with me  I also know many women in their 30s and 40s who have very active dating love lives  You're nowhere near done yet      I know I'm 4 days late  but still  if you're still there  don't kill yourself  Your father will have what he deserves  trust me  I know It sounds generic  but I doubt your mother or sister can stand him  just like you  In the end  he'll find himself lonely  since he will have chosen that path on his own   Also  I care about you too  I bet we could have been best friends if we met before  You seem like a rational guy  and I also want to be a game developer    Don't give up just yet  You have been enduring that shit this whole time  and mostly  don't give that asshole the pleasure of not having to take care of you anymore  Get help from the police  trust me    PM me if you ever need a new friend    http   imgur com iKcbdLM It's your turn to live your life and live for yourself  I have regular depression and anxiety  I had to go on ativan for a year and a half after my daughters were born because my post partum anxiety was  out of control   I constantly felt guilty  I constantly felt like I wasn't doing a good job  the ativan calmed me down enough to just be able to be in the moment without constantly excoriating myself  I was actually able to enjoy their time as babies  I mean  as much as anyone can when you're never able to sleep through the night   Please get help  you're not alone  Fluoride helps teeth  It does not "fuck" them up   Preaching to the choir   As far as your family troubles  always handle all you do with courage  confidence  and humor  Kid  life is meant to be enjoyed and meant to be spent with good feelings and love in your heart  this world needs good people  we dont need another sad person  Thank you for the detailed response  i agree that people may think that about me since i often come off as someone who doesnt care about anything though i really do  but wouldnt me constantly arranging meetings and asking them to play games make them think that i really want to hang out with them    Again thanks for the great response i really appreciate you trying to help me  It could be that relationships just aren't for you  As long as you're happy in general  who cares  Having kids isn't for some people  Being hetero cis whatever the kids call it these days isn't for everyone  Asexuality is a thing  so having sex isn't for some people   Now  if you feel depressed about not having a relationship  that's different  and perhaps it would be helpful to talk with someone professionally  But if you're just asking because your mom bugged you about it again  then just let her know that you are straight  and you just aren't interested in relationships at the moment  but you appreciate her caring about you   Wait and see if you even receive an invitation first   I know it's anecdotal but depression can totally change the way you act  I pulled out of a depression not too long ago but I'm still paranoid and sometimes I catch myself just being a flat out bitch to people  I doubt it's just him being a jerk of his own volition  Therapy would do him some good  I hope he's receptive to it  I know the feeling  I am turning 25 in February and feel ok about it  I used to have a real thing about aging too when I was around your age  Now that I'm older I don't know what I was so worried about  life tends to get better  plus it probably helps that I still look early 20s   What are some of your interests  Have you considered joining any local groups  If you feel like you aren't getting beyond acquaintance level with people  try taking additional steps for one on one activities   For example  if you joined a book club at your library and meet some new folks  take the opportunity to invite one or two of them over to watch a movie adaptation of a book you like  or to join you in another activity they mention they also enjoy    Something else to consider is making a list of three or four things you've always wanted to try but didn't for whatever reason  It gives you a chance to meet some new folks and it's empowering to know you tried something new  which can make you feel more confident   This article really opened my eyes to another side of the issue  I feel like I understand the problem better now  Very interesting   r personalfinance may be better suited for this question  Thats about 20 dollars or less a month  You can either go to an informed consent clinic or get a recommendation by a gender therapist   People usually dont get sex reassignment surgery on a whim  Its a major purchase that requires a lot of saving  Or your insurance might cover it  It also requires two medical professionals to sign off on it   Im assuming you're in the US  Take up a hobby or craft  Think of something you're good at and become self employed by showing other people how to do it   when you find work you can still do this work on the side    You're 100  correct that therapy will not be effective if you do not trust your therapist  Lack of trust is detrimental to building therapeutic rapport  without which you cannot hope to make progress  My best advice is to disclose to your therapist what you've stated here and devote your sessions to working on this issue  since resolving any other issues will depend on it  I can assure you that it's a common issue and your therapist probably has some inkling that you're not being completely honest  Some therapists will confront their clients about it but perhaps yours is waiting to see if you bring it up  and moving at your pace  Another option would be to seek help from someone else if you think you have a better chance at establishing trust with a different therapist who perhaps possesses different characteristics from your current one  Nobody ever wants to speak to me nor does anyone text me or even be near me  Everyone avoids me like I am some kind of disease and will completely ignore me  Also I tutor mostly 12 15 year olds just to clear up that confusion  Most kids hate me too  Too much of the stuff is  bad  https   en wikipedia org wiki Dental fluorosis   R exnocontact I've always thought that interesting and intelligent people were the ones who were   curious   about things and might learn a little about a lot of subjects  Like  world intelligence  People with stories about things they've done  places they've gone   a whole bunch of shades to their personality   I live in the tech capital of the world and I'm surrounded by people who are mind blowingly smart in something specific  but can't function outside that one topic   Personally  I think people like you who have a multitude of ideas are the most wonderful kind of person to run into  If you're interested in a topic but afraid to speak up  try asking questions during the conversation  People like to hear themselves talk  and you'll be learning as well  I hope that all makes sense  As someone else ITT has already stated  dogs adapt very well to new living conditions  granted they're relatively young  I live with two roommates and we have a german shepherd living with us  he's not even a year old and he's already massive  but he's settled in quite nicely  Just pick a dog that fits your aesthetic preferences   as long as it has the right temperament and training any breed will suffice  Personal preference but imo terriers and smaller "high energy" dogs are the exception  although I do find them annoying so take that with a grain of salt  That's a good point  but I don't know if I would consider us semi close    You're right that it's only one night  and I assume she wouldn't send me an invite if she hated me  but I wouldn't want her to pay for a seat for a "semi close friend " But that's just me    Can I ask  did your friend not show because they thought you weren't close   Thanks  that's pretty much it exactly  I'm fine just hanging out with a few friends instead of partying  even though I still feel a little left out for some weird reason  but even that ended up being kind of a bust  It honestly feels kind of nice to just let myself not feel good every now and then  but it was burning me up keeping it up inside  Now that I've talked about it more I feel a LOT better  Thank you guys for listening  Repeating a lie over and over again will not make it true  I should have said this in the post  but she recently messaged me asking for my address for an invitation      I do have a family that cares and I see professionals but I find everytime I'm in a meeting with a doctor or whatever  I don't care to bring things up that I had been thinking of   About things getting better   that's exactly what I no longer believe   That's very true about the melancholy anxiety  I'd like to think that's not what it is  that it's unrelated to all that  But of course that's a big part of it   That's also an interesting point  When I spend my NYE at home watching the celebration on TV  it's kind of a flashback to years as a child doing the same thing and feeling isolated from the world  If that makes any sense  This has to be a joke  how do you let things escalate to this degree  You both need serious psychiatric help  like now  Hey OP  I've not lost a job but I have witnessed many others who have either by choice or not  My advice to you is   Get your house in order  get to know yourself  and get out there and be of value to someone or somebody who is in need of help    1  Get your house in order  More so literally  Keep your place clean and make sure it gets done every day  Never slack and get behind   2  Get to know yourself  I believe that you see more of a real you when in times of need  now  That means you get to know who you are and how you get in a low part of your life  Make sure you come out the other side better than before   3  Be of value to someone in need  Volunteering or getting a part time job somewhere where you will be face to face with people all day will help you immensely  Seriously  Being there for someone else will make you feel worth it and you'll also get to brighten someone else's day   I hope you are enjoying your time and hope everything turns out all right  I'm going to say something that isn't comforting  but it is probably the right thing to do  Think about this whole matter from C's perspective  Take a long walk in his shoes  He is dealing with depression  and to such a severity that he considered killing himself  Now for whatever reason  I do not know   but it was possibly the fear of losing you as a friend  You may think this doesn't make sense  but depression eats at your cognitive abilities  The thing is  he found someone to confide in  and there was nothing wrong with that  Rather  that confiding in D probably helped him calm down a bit and talk himself down  Your involvement in the matter was out of good intention and I get that  I'm not saying the choice you made was right  as you involved more people whom made C uncomfortable  The thing is  he even apologized to you and you ignored him  He was still depressed and insecure  and wanted to confide in you again  despite what he saw as a betral  Should you make amends  Definitely  but this time  you should be the one apologizing for only escalating what he was going through  I'm not trying to make you feel bad or condemn you in some way  Don't think of it like that  I'm just an outside perspective  What I am driving at is that I would say this guy needs people in his life who are willing to accept him for all that he is  So if you do make amends  be understanding of him and know he's just trying to get by  Just like you and me    Said by someone who has never suffered from being unloved their whole fucking god damned life   This also sounds like something a best friend I had for a while would have said to me  "My pleasure" is definitely one of his phrases  If that's you Andrew  I'm doing alright  And it's okay  I'm not mad  I've got no residual anger or bad feelings  Just good memories  I hope you're doing well too  Happy New Year   My fianc and I just broke up  We love each other  but it seems like the same thing that's happening to you happened to us  Every time we're together  things are amazing until they just aren't  There's no real reason we can't be together  but these small insignificant arguments just keep popping up  it's like  We  Just  Can't  Make  It  Work    It's incredibly frustrating  and sad  Even now I'm wondering why we're apart   I would relate to this if I actually had any friends at all  I have the same goal except it's so that I can ride a sport bike fast  Yeah   You were daring for Years because you were in high school and high school has limited choices and cause it's cool to be dating in high school  You are about to enter the big boy play ground     It makes complete sense  Here's hoping that   if only from an internet stranger   you don't feel isolated knowing someone else is sending positive vibes your way  I won't say that every adoption is easy  Both my sister and my mother were adopted  I can say that at least twice  it worked out well  I also have at least 3 friends who are adopted and obviously being adopted comes with it's challenges  but IMO it's better than keeping a child you can't properly care for and a great alternative for those that don't agree with abortion or don't have access to it   Also as quick note  closed adoptions are the way to go which avoid the most amount of drama  It's very hard to have a closed inter family adoption  And that can lead to lots of issues   also from personal experience  Send her a stupid selfie captioned something along the lines of "Start a streak with me"  Go from there  I lost my father 3 months back  He died of multiple organ failure due to septic shock  I spoke to him on phone for less than 20 seconds  I remember asking him  "How do you feel now  daddy " for which he said "still the same dear  "  We both were in different countries  different continents  I travelled to see him when he was in ICU  Everyone said he will be alright  I prayed to god  cried in the flight the whole journey to see him alive  By the time I reached he was on ventilator   I promised him many things while he was in ventilator  Hope was the only thing left  After 4 days of fight  he didn't make it  My last promise to him was  I will take care of mother and will send you to heaven with a smile  I didn't cry  I cried when he received guard of honour as he was a doctor in military  I used to cry alone after that  I didn't want to cry in front of my mother thinking she will become weak  My advice to you would be to stay strong and keep your family strong  gather all the moments and keep it safe  take responsibility and live the life as it comes coz it's unpredictable  Trust me you will come out stronger  Ok  So have you looked into hospitalizing yourself in a residential facility  It seems like things are really tough for you right now  and that's not something you can really deal with properly on your own  And it appears that your father clearly has his own set of struggles that makes him not able to properly care for you during yours  It all depends on the situation  Sometimes you round down and times you go up  I would just round up  Oh my God  Do did we have the same friend  I have one who is exactly as you described  Every so often I take a break from her  we go to different colleges so it's relatively easy to do  but I can't cut her off completely because she does care about me in a roundabout way  But yeah one time we were at a mutual friend's house and the mutual friend's parent asked me  "Don't I know you from  hardware store where I worked in high school  " And before I could even answer she piped up and says  "I worked at a hardware store too "  Not the same one   And I'm like  dude  It's not like he was saying  "Aren't you the only person in this room who's ever worked at a hardware store " He was just making a connection to where he knew me from  The same connection didn't exist for her  but she just had to latch onto anything she could use to return attention to herself  We've been best friends for the better part of a decade  whoa    holy shit  so I know her pretty well and once took a narcissism screening test for her  You can guess what the results were  Haha  I hate saying such horrible things but I do question the friendship a lot   As does everyone I know   But her redeeming qualities make it impossible to break things off  who am I to judge  I have my own issues too  But I guess it comes down to the fact that I'm not judging her  I'm judging my own needs  She just doesn't treat me well 85  of the time  That doesn't mean she's not worthy of friendship at all  mine just probably isn't the best fit for her  Ugh  anyway  Maybe I should have posted in this sub myself  haha  Thanks for providing me with a relatable prompt to get this off my chest  And if you feel really bad about ending the friendship  maybe try the "break" thing that I do  I find that after a few weeks or even months without close contact  I am much fresher and more forgiving toward her  And she's so overbearing that it's easy to resume our friendship from where I we  not explicitly  left off   Another case for there being no absolute value for relationships   But no matter what don't feel too guilty  As long as you weren't a huge jerk in ending the friendship  you 100  deserve to do what's best for you and your emotional health  It's a hard decision to make so good job making positive strides for yourself  Something  no  the ONLY thing that has helped me with these difficult issues is the teachings of Buddha  Please read When Things Fall Apart by Pema Chodron  and Radical Acceptance by Tara Brach  Amazing and truthful advice that can transform your suffering into healing  Also  if you need something right now  go to DharmaSeed org and search for Jack Kornfield under teachers  I promise listening to him will help  Is your depression due solely to being an atheist and having to hide it  And you also don't need to explain why you're depressed  Maybe you could tell your parents that you've been feeling really depressed recently and ask if they'd help you get professional help  Psychologist do not tell your parents what you talk about during your sessions  and could provide you some really helpful tools to cope with your feelings and guidance on where to go from here  And also probably help you talk to your parents about your religious beliefs if you ever wanted to  Great advice  I've had issues with flaky friends in the past  especially when it came to birthday parties of mine  I always feel like shit if I have to bail last minute on plans so I really try not to do it to other people  Last year  for example  I organised a 21st birthday dinner for myself and organised it a month in advance  only to have 6 "friends" bail last minute  It really upset me and now I have a very low tolerance for flaking  I have a three strikes policy now  I understand that it's not always possible to attend events but have the decency to give the host sufficient notice that you're not coming  And if you say you're going to attend an event  suck it up and commit  It's not hard   Maybe they don't add much to the conversation when you're around  Do you really think invites are handed out for no reason at all  Just to spite the people who "deserve" the invites  Don't let ego and cognitive dissonance distract you from reality  If you aren't invited it means they have no reason to invite you  And it isn't unfair  would you invite a random person for no reason  Maybe if you were desperate and wanted as many people attending as possible  but for the most part  well I'm sure you know the answer  I broke up with my gf of a years 2 weeks ago  It's hard  But you're stronger than this I can imagine people would be less willing to be around someone unattractive but unattractive people can still have friends  Do people avoid because of what you say  Also I find it silly that people give the "17 is too young to be FA" when most people here are only 20       12 15 year olds  I would still view this as an accomplishment plus being smart enough and having enough to put on a resume to get accepted to a good school  Bipolar disorder needs medication like diabetes needs insulin   Stop putting pressure on yourself where there doesn't need to be   There are many medications that do not make you feel like a zombie  That will help you care for your child by being the best version of yourself  Avoiding something that can help ease your pain and give you a step up is not a strength  it's a stubbornness that needs to end now   You cannot see clearly right now  please use anything you can to help shift the axis of your world again so you can end up on top   Source  Bipolar mother  went back on meds when my son was 5 months old   If you don't allow yourself to feel bad once in awhile it piles up until it gets to be too much to handle  Happy you are feeling better after talking it out  Best wishes for the new year   I feel as if you should distract him from the thought of the girl  Do you guys have a friend group that can take him out to eat or have a good time or something  If so  be supportive and do that for him  Take him out for some food or the arcade or something  If you live in the city  bring him to fun spots  If you know him well enough  you should be able to lift his spirit  And speak to him  Definitely keep talking to him  If he doesn't want your company  be persistent and give him the company he needs  Take the bottle away from him  Tell you how you feel about the alcohol  Tell him the dangers  Persuade him to stop drinking  Even lying about a situation is easy  Create a scenario about a friend who died after something so stupid like this  Tell him there are more fish in the sea and that the perfect one is soon to bite his tackle  Tell him that it takes time  You're an atom bumping into random other atoms and one day you'll be attracted to one idk something like that  But anyways good luck  My advice is vague ish and sorta like what anyone else would say but yea this is what i got sorry if it sucks    good luck  its not a huge deal to not go  being a weding guest means you are obliged to buy a gift  generally speaking   and it's expensive for whoever's paying for the wedding to pay for each guest who plans to attend  so i say you might as well save yourself and the bride  whoever's paying for the wedding some money  in the end  the couple should spend their wedding day with the people who truly wanna be there  its ok if you dont  and that doesnt mean that your friendship will end  not every friend goes to every wedding  stop trying to be friends with your ex If you don't support yourself while in Florida  ie  you work part time or parents still support you  then you won't qualify for residency in Florida  You also have to establish residency in Florida for at least a year prior to starting school to qualify for in state tuition  PM me for more info if needed  I went through the same dilemma myself last year  It's my destiny  Hold on  don't listen to this  While it's with good meaning that is NOT sound business advice   Hire a firm to find a replacement CEO  Move out of the operations roles   If you haven't already read "the 4 hour work week"  The loneliness thing will not go away by becoming poor  you actually skipped ahead in time by becoming successful   Go to college and meet cool people and date   Stop opening new businesses  you're not ready to develop your investment group yet  That will be for the next stage when you're refreshed and ready  Who let the normies in   he just put me on unemployment and told me if i wanted to keep working on some web stuff  i said yea but never really returned Clearly  somebody pissed on your pants  I think that you were perhaps too hasty when seeking help  Though it's a good attitude since you were trying to help  you exposed C in a way she  he probably didn't feel comfortable with  Hence the backstabber  C might have felt that she he couldn't trust you anymore or that you should have at least tried to talk to her him first  By the end of it she  he realized she  he didn't mean it since she sensed you only cared for her him  And you ignored that  For a whole year  If you do talk to her  him apologize and make sure that when she   he needs you again you will be there for him   her and won't bail like this time   That being said  u Sabstis Egroge explained very well C's perspective  Please understand how C felt before talking to him her Bingo  this is a sound solution  Even if it takes 2 3 people hired to handle all those things it's important that he as the owner take himself out of the functional role and simply start looking at 1 4 financial reports and CEO board briefings  How did this turn out  I think it might be normal  If you jack it enough  maybe twice a day  I'm sure it will start to feel a bit sore  Probably nothing a doctor could do except for give you some ointment  which will just make it feel like he splurged anyways  The best thing OP can do is just wait a few days in between jacking it  but it doesn't seem to be his decision    Why would he want to get a job   He should hire a CEO and retire to 1 4 reports from the CEO board    why would he throw the business away if it's not at capacity  I got strep throat multiple times per year starting around age 14   My dad refused to have them taken out   After age 19  I never got another strep throat infection again   36 years later  no infections   All these people stating they had it done and all problems stop missed the part in the article that said problems usually stop on their own    i think you should just ask him about what you have observed if he has been a friend this long you should be able to talk things out and get to the bottom of your concerns w o causing a scene  if afterwards you feel like he is dodging questions of generally acting suspicious then maybe talk to someone else about it    i say this as a long time friend of his dont immediately jump to conclusion that he's doing something wrong  maybe with his upbringing and sexual orientation he is simply trying to reach out to a younger crowd to give anyone a brotherly figure or someone to talk to if he senses they might be struggling with a problem    you only gave 1 example of something bad happening and even that could fall on the younger person freaking out that he was gay when he told him and have nothing to do with anything they did together    given the seriousness of going to any authoritative figure and suggesting someone is exhibiting pedophile like traits is not something they can come back from if its not true they will always then be labeled it by someone especially if that person told starts to tell everyone they know w o knowing if it is actually true or not  im not well versed in the world of business or finance  but i will say that most employers will not ask you what your gpa was  or even what your major was  generally speaking   if you dont want to go to graduate school  then your gpa wont seriously hurt you in most cases    now  if you want to get an advanced degree after your bachelors  then you might want to try and increase your GPA  its normal for graduate schools to have a cut off for competitive GPAs  normally bw 3 0 3 5 minimum  ways to increase GPA  take easier classes  spend your summers taking courses that you know youll succeed in at a community college  and just the old fashioned study study study    also   a healthty mental state is so helpful when it comes to school performance  maintaining a healthy state for yourself is the most important  more important than your GPA or your major    good luck  Well  there you go   Unless you want to care more  And that's what's making you unhappy  Then   again   might be good to talk to someone  Heck  if you're not happy  maybe as another poster wrote  open up to your mom about the real reasons  Or to someone   I was alone   and it would have seeped through into my underwear right   not healthy  It keeps me from going insane First step is time  I feel like this one topic isn't stressed enough  Allow time to rekindle your passion and interest  One day you might just walk around and see something you like and start thinking really hard about it  And from there you might develop an interest in the thing you saw    I'm sure you listen to music right  Hey  Explore some different genres of music on Pandora  Or use spotify it sure helped me when I was trying to chill    I have many hobbies such as playing the guitar  singing  piano  basketball  golf  gaming  and many others I can't think off the top of my head rn  BUT pick something up    Go for that instrument that you always wanted to learn or just purchase an instrument  Or go to a local guitar center or instrument store and chill there    Hey and eating always solves anything  BTW it's kinda sounding like these tips are for chilling which most of them are    OR YOU CAN SMOKE WEED AND OR DRINK BUT BOTH ARE DANGEROUS NOT ADVISING YOU TO DO THAT BUT I MEAN HEY IF IT HELPS IT HELPS   I suggest you take a walk  And think while drinking your favorite beverage or eating your favorite food  Or spend time with friends and try and find the passion in them  Ask them for advice    Sorry if these tips don't work but I tried   Good luck   fly to vancouver bc canada and come visit Dude  it's crazy stressful in a way most people don't understand   Imagine you're the only person on earth that can treat cancer and you're making insane money but every time you look out the the line of patients only is getting longer and longer by the day   Do you stop  Or do you keep going   It's a double edge sword  let down customers or let down yourself  Meanwhile the correct answer is neither  hire someone  or multiple  to replace you  You should definitely try out meditation as some people say that it works wonders   Another thing to try  while it's obviously easier said than done  is to just slow down and worry about what's going on now   Don't worry about what will happen in the future or expect yourself to be perfect in any way   No one has everything figured out  so if you just relax and try your hardest in whatever aspect this anxiety is coming  hopefully it will subside a bit  You took off your pants and got into bed  You woke up in the middle of the night to piss  and you decided to piss onto your pants  The pants soaked up the urine  leaving the floor dry  Thank you so much  I appreciate the kind words and I will take you up on that pm offer sooner than later  My mom went to Costa Rica to retrieve him so we can move forward and I am watching my siblings  I know he is watching me  i will keep you updated with what is going on   One would think   The plot thickens   Good luck   You might not like the answers you find    This does sound like mild depression  which can be a symptom of things like Seasonal Affective disorder  a very common condition that a lot of people have   You just need to learn some coping skills  which you can research for yourself online   Whether it's SAD or something else  lots of people have mild depressive episodes that they are able to resolve without a psychiatrist or medication   Just get some coping skills   Maybe see your school counselor if you can't figure out any coping skills on your own  You are all in my thoughts and I appreciate the support  Trying to figure out where to go from here   Please report it  It's literally a crime that was committed   And when you report it  they will likely be able to point you in the direction of some resources to help you deal with the emotions you're having now  which are totally understandable   Einstein was missing a piece of his brain  It will  It will get easier  First mama you need to do some self care  You are ok  You will get better  It's hard right now   but  it willl  Get  Better  I have a few diagnosiss  so if you ever need to talk  Iim here  I never really got a reason  My exgf's parents reacted just like yours when she told them she was bisexual   I remember once when we were visiting her parents her Mom said something like "you should be worried that no man is going to want you when they find out you've been with women "  I was sitting right next to her at the time all    you know    being a man and wanting her   I don't get it man  not exactly because I live in florida during college and I also am moving there after I get my bachelors for grad school    This girl sounds so messed up   You stick your duck in crazy   She's very unstable and if you express your anger towards her uncle you'll just be sucked further down her black hole of insanity   If I were you I'd find an anger management support group  to help you get past the way you treated her and the way you feel about her uncle   You and her  both  need emotional help  but you need to worry only about yourself  As a rule  yeah  All it does is escalate the situation and drag you down to their level  It's also likely you'll lose the respect of anyone who witnesses it  Even if you were in the right  somebody who immediately stoops to insulting you isn't going to understand that whether you insult them back or not  but they'll know they got to you and feel like they "won"  It's best to disengage as much as possible and move on to something else  Insulting people and generally being nasty is toxic  eventually it starts getting to you  how you feel about yourself and how you interact with other people    Edit  The exception to this would be playful situations with people who are okay with it being a part of your relationship  For example  me and my best friend regularly roast each other  but never during an argument or serious conversations  We are also careful to respect each other's boundaries because we don't ever want to hurt each other  and always apologize immediately if we do so accidentally   Unfortunately things like that do happen and I know how it feels to kind of watch it fizzle out   I think the biggest problem though  just from reading your post  is that it seems to me like you were so comfortable in this relationship that you didn't really try to go out and find other meaningful friendships   People do change over time and you may never know why she's pulling away   It may not even be something that you did   It's really important though to try to go out and do things that you want to do  like pursuing hobbies  sports  etc  and meeting people along the way   Not every person is going to become a great friend  but the more people you meet the higher the chance that you'll find someone you connect with   Remember too that no friendship is going to start out exactly at the level you are with this friend now   It takes time to build and so try not to compare people to her and possibly drop them because the relationship doesn't feel as strong right away   Best of luck to you and stay strong   I know it must be hard  I try to get out once in a while  and lately it seems that I've been seeing a lot of people on tinder dates in the coffee shops  Dudes pretty much better looking than me  with chicks I could see myself dating  I try not to let it get me down  but it's difficult  I know im trying to get residency for the remainder 2 years and for grad school and I plan on living there for grad school  That's awesome  Although I'm wondering why you're including mexican foods in there  Maybe some Americanized Mexican foods are bad but traditional food is generally very healthy  Probably most important is all the fiber you're getting from beans  and then lots of fruits and veg like tomatoes  chilies  avocado  cilantro  onion  Tortillas are better for you than white bread  more fiber   Same with tortilla chips and potato chips  Dessert or appetizers can very often be a fruit like cantaloupe or mango  OP  just today I posted in this very Sub about my experiences with my pedophile  family abusing father  Though that wasn't actually the end of my story  I can relate to yours as my mom is also choosing to stay by his side  She didn't know before I outed him  so I'm sorry to hear that your mom has made even worse choices that carried serious consequences    Of course your story isn't one you want to tell  and therefore others will not understand why you're walking around looking like a mannequin    I made the mistake of explaining to a coworker what had happened  and the sympathy I received was very unwelcome  It may seem like it'd be great for others to feel for your case  but I can say with confidence it won't make you feel any better  For starters  if they thought he was just dead you'd be forced to hear people saying all sorts of nice and wonderful things about a person who deserves no sort of thoughts  If they knew the true story you'd have blurry faces trying to connect  to try and empathize where they have no business or true understanding to do so    I'm only a month out from the discovery and am still spiraling downward  I hope you can find stable ground to land  it'd be nice to know someone in a similar boat didn't drown in misery  like I feel I will     Just get back with her if you love her   She's not suffering if she walked into the relationship knowing you are studying medicine   and usually preoccupied    Canny your local police's non emergency number   They have burglary specialists who can come to your house and look around   They can tell you if this is a typical thief MO or if something unexplainable happened  Whos to say I didnt move out of my parents house and attend school in florida while also staying at the family friends house for free on breaks   what would someone in that situation do  You should of quit before you took the drug test  That way you don't have to take it and within 6 months be rehired for that company  Since they do drug tests the company you work for may have zero tolerance to drugs policy  You will be fired  and never be eligible to be hired by whatever that company owns  Sorry  and for the parents I doubt they will contact them since you're the employee and not them  Therapy   Loss of interest is an early sign of depression   It may get worse  so you should seek help sooner than later  Not a smart idea  Opening old wounds won't do much after all this time  From what I can tell you seem to just feel some nostalgia  which will pass  And say a friendship blossoms again  it will only be a matter of time before something like that happens again  It's something that I've seen happen over and over again with people  myself included  and it's never worth it  I would recommend leaving the past in the past  I hope this helps I know what you mean  Having similar trouble with it myself  While I got to spend the holiday with people that I like  The entire time it felt off  I felt so very distant from everyone and I'm not sure why  I mean even though I was surrounded by people I call my friends I felt alone  It has been an awesome year in terms of getting my life closer to what I want but even though I have been working on improving myself  While I have people I call friends that I care for a great deal  I don't know if I can count on them or if i'm just that weird acquaintance they tolerate being around for whatever reason  I know part of that loneliness comes from not having any sort of significant other or companion close friend in my life  For me growing up New Year's was always another one of those holidays people celebrate the joy of being a couple  the whole kiss your SO and celebrate the start of another year with them thing is something I want  Being perpetually single makes that impossible and mildly depressing   If you can identify what causes the lonely feelings or what triggers you to pull away or disconnect from people you can start figuring out what you need to do to change that  It's not something that will change overnight or maybe even this year but it sounds like you are able to identify some of it so that's something  Best of luck in working through it  I know it can be rough but you can do it  You are not alone  For me  it's not something I feel I  need  to do  but it does fall into the category of "cliche" things that I've always wanted to do  That's where most of my anguish about being alone comes from  it's missing out on such seemingly simple things that other people get to celebrate without even having to try  I agree  When I was struggling with depression I had a short fuse  I was very irritable and mean for no reason  After some psychiatrist appointments and therapy  I started changing those behaviors  He may just need some help kick starting himself in the right direction   How to go about this  I have no idea  Telling a person in that state that they need help may make them defensive  Just let him know you care about him  and that you've noticed some things that suggest he might be going through something bigger  Suffering depression or going to therapy aren't signs of weakness  Conquering the fears and making the steps to beat it are actually signs of strength in my eyes   There is also a chance he's just a lazy jerk and needs a rude awakening  like my 33 year old alcoholic brother who still lives with his parents    I am so incredibly proud of you   You're a strong person to be doing this and you're a wonderful  amazing mother  You can do this  That took me awhile that you meant ACT and not act   The other comments are correct  and I want to emphasize that you should seriously drop the drugs   You're in a bad spot if they're causing you this many problems  let alone causing these problems at 15   Remember though that you're still young   Everyone has gone through what you're going through at one point or another  and you need to keep in mind that you can create positive changes in your life  even if it's just by taking baby steps   It's the new year  so take all of those things you listed that make you unhappy and make a goal to change them or even to get on track to change them   There's a ton of stuff online that you can find on how to change your life  and you just need to put it into action   Best of luck and pm me if you ever need to talk  Ugh   weddings  I'm just trying to get to the date  Fuck every year  Wow  That's sad  I'm sorry     My mother has bipolar disorder  coupled with some anxiety and PTSD  The best thing she ever did for herself and our relationship is agree to go to the hospital  I know it can be scary  especially knowing that the medication can be so trial and error but I think it would be great for you  They can show you more ways of coping and help to get you stable  there is a bipolar subreddit that I follow as well that may give you some encouragement that you need  Best of luck with your treatment  3  Edit  It's r bipolar  not sure why I didn't link it before  meetups  my friend moved to a new city after college and she has met people thru meetups on facebook  there are so many groups out there who meet up weekly    also you can find people who are new to the city the same way  and you can bond over your experiences moving   I can only assure you that you have a 100  right to feel the way you do  I am sorry that it happened       In Guilty Plea  OxyContin Maker to

scientificamerican com article trial sans error how pharma funded research cherry picks positive results     No personally identifying information is allowed on Reddit  Excatly  tired of ppl treating me like shit I've seen a lot of people on dating sites that claim they are in school  constantly traveling  2 jobs  etc   I do wonder how they think they could manage a relationship  While "tough love" isn't banned  using it on someone who is potentially suicidal can actually get you banned  Honestly  I don't care how qualified these people are either  because I've talked to multiple therapists who were extremely qualified yet had no idea about the first thing when it came to FA  I gave my last therapist  300 over a few sessions and all I got was "tough love" when he told me to "stop going on the internet  then start going out to meet people " When I told him I tried for years and still failed he said "it's because you were going on the internet which is causing you to be negative so people don't want to talk to you" which is complete bullshit  In order for there to be "tough love" there has to be "love" as someone below said  How can a stranger you have never talked to before "love" you  They obviously can't  so that isn't "tough love"  it's just being a dick  I don't care how much money the person makes helping people  We have no idea how to verify anything on here  and that approach has failed every single time someone has tried to use it on here  They get mad and say it's because we didn't want to change but in reality  it's because they never actually gave a shit about us  They just wanted to feel better about themselves instead of helping us feel better about ourselves which the goal should be  for the sleep issue  you can try not looking at screens for at least an hour before you plan tk sleep  that might help you fall asleep faster   False dichotomy      Learning is good   but also      I'll take your lottery win on your behalf then     They are pointless  It's just a way to waste time when sitting in waiting rooms  Very important wisdom  That's also really spot on  I felt distant from my mother because we were having some misunderstandings in communication but we talked it out so I feel better about that  But I also felt very distant from some of my close friends  It's hard to pinpoint exactly but it's pretty much what you said  I felt really insecure and like they were just being nice to me and didn't think very much of me  It's odd that we both were feeling that  I don't know know why New Year's brings that out more   I know that I need to figure that out and the answer isn't to pull away more  But I don't really know how to put my insecurities at ease or talk to them about that without seeming needy or embarrassing   Thank you because your comments are more helpful than you might think  I hope you are feeling better and have a great year  Yes it sounds internal    It might be your ego playing you    by feeling less than him  Just remember everyone is different and we all got our strengths and weakness  The hideous suffering stopped after my tonsils were removed   No more painful sore throat  fever  pain with swallowing  headache  horrible feeling of unwell  etc   The worst pain was the anguish in my mother's eye every time I suffered the symptoms of tonsillitis  I have felt the same many times myself and I would find something that you've enjoyed and explore it  If you want to do something cool in your life you have to work for it  I really want to travel and be able to hear stories from people everywhere so I put effort into learning new languages  Find a way to make progress every day  if that means lifting or learning a new word or drawing a new animal  If you watch the office  you have to find your acapella group  Also if your friend makes you happy than you should invest as much time as possible improving your relationship because you want to have a release  Don't sink because you gave upThis sounds really sappy i know Ugh  I'm sorry  I see this all the time  People that want to date  but not really  Or people who are "just looking for whatever"  Such a waste of

works with grad school financing  but if its not a financial burden for you to drop out and study something else that interests you more than law  somewhere closer to your home  then you should probably look into that   but if you are gonna drop out  you should have at least some sort of a plan for yourself  whether it be to find a job back home or to start applying to different schools As someone who has struggled with suicidal thoughts depression for a while  I can understand the regret of lashing out at the people closest to you when they really just wanted to help    That being said  I made amends with my close friends that I hurt really badly and we're fine now  but you can't really tell if C has genuinely gotten better and changed as a person  I think a heart to heart with them would be a good thing for both of you  for you to settle the dust and see if being friends again is a good idea  and for C to understand your worries about being friends again    Maybe you don't have to be the closest of friends again  but having some kind of relationship would be okay  Good luck op x  Ur capslock r oddlysatisfying What is the alternative   You can also try taking a melatonin supplement about 1 hour before you want to sleep  not look at screens  do some reason  maybe school related  to help you get tired    For school work  it's all will power  You either convince yourself that your future is important and you need to do it  or you don't do it and you fail  so maybe make a list with due dates in the order of importance or whatever and just keep knocking stuff off the list   I'm so sorry  Bad things happen to good people and I want to kick the shit out of that guy  If you need someone to talk to you can message me  3 First off don't worry about sounding conceited or anything like that   Everyone has problems and yours are just as legitimate   Also please don't hurt yourself in any way   It isn't worth it   Unfortunately  the hard truth is that it's going to be so hard just because you're 17   You're still young and you're going to make mistakes   People will probably be playing games in terms of dating and not being straightforward with each other   The only thing I can say is that what you need to do to separate yourself from everyone else your age is to accept responsibility for your mistakes and learn from them   Hopefully this doesn't sound too harsh  but from this you can learn and change a few things   The first is to limit your alcohol intake at parties because now you know what can happen if you don't   The second thing is to start studying because  though I hate to say it  school should be a priority   It can also help to take your mind off of everything   The last thing is to  at least in my opinion  message her a bit differently   Right off the bat I'll admit that this is just my opinion and it may be wrong because I don't know her  but I think you should maturely own up to what happened   I'm not saying that your message was this immature  but imagine if the situation had been reversed and she sent a message to you the next day of "lol I drank so much last night right " vs  something more serious and mature like "Could we speak about what happened last night  I made a mistake and went overboard but it seems like there's tension between us now and I'd like to make it right "  Again those aren't the exact words but hopefully you get what I mean   Overall though try not to worry too much about it   I promise you'll find another girl if this doesn't work out and you should try your best to forgive yourself for an honest mistake   Best of luck and pm me if you need to talk more  Ignore her  she likes to look for attention  The amount of people she has ghosted after crying for attention on r r4r and r foreveralonedating is insane  I'm definitely not the only one and have seen numerous guys post the exact same thing in her previous dating posts that she has now deleted  I sent a well thought out message sympathizing with her and relating to her from my own life experiences  she replied with a decent enough message saying she wanted to chat then boom  ghosted  Next thing I know she is coming on here posting for attention and pasting her tits all over the internet   Poor thing is so alone guys  It's not hard to spot an attention  seeker  they will say things like    I try so hard to find a significant other but I refuse to settle for just anyone   The problem isn't the other person  it's you wasting people's time so you can look for attention   Salty rant over   Edit  Big fucking surprise  she deleted it  This girl is a fucking parasite  I downloaded like 20 gay dating apps   lol  I'm gonna sign up and pay for match com as I would hope the people there might be more serious about actually dating   I'm also going to as many meetup com groups as I can and try to start my own for adult fans of Lego  I'm in a social anxiety group  and it's been helping me   Finally  being more serious about losing weight   only 15 more lbs to go  by eating less junk  yes but i was wondering if i also had to pay my own florida taxes as an independent or would I have no taxes since I am not paying rent or paying to live in the house Go do it  It's nice to feel financially secure  One less thing to worry about  Just live within your means and retire as early as you can     you need to be 100  honest with both your parents and your doctor  you obviously know something isn't right  and unfortunately these issues don't usually sort themselves out  take it from me  get help sooner rather than later  you don't realize what you've got till it's gone    I'd rather just let it be known how I feel right now   Well  how  do  you feel right now  You could just send a message for closure  and say  "Hey  I just realised I'd missed your past messages  Just wanted you to know  no hard feelings and I hope you are doing well  Take care " or whatever makes sense to you  just finish out the degree then go to massage therapy school after   even if the degree is meaningless to your current career aspirations  you never know where life will lead you  a college degree will help you in lots of scenarios  from getting a job to getting a specialized degree    one more semester   psh you got this The thing is  I can't be honest   I'm having a brief period of lucidity where I know I'm acting crazy but I can feel my paranoia on the edge of my mind   It's almost tangible and I can't say it out loud   I can type it here  where my family won't see because if they know what I think and I'm right it will be really  really bad   This is already really bad  The only thing you can do is to remember that life is happening all around us and to every single person  and that you can't do anything about it   I know that sounds kind of depressing but it's true   You played absolutely no part in a relative dying  and it was going to happen anyway  as it will to everyone who's ever lived and will live    You also can't stop the fact that people change as they age and sometimes people just grow apart   There's nothing you can do about it except to part on good terms and wish them all the best   Also try to remember that what's done is done  and while you can't go back and fix things  you can try to make sure they don't get any worse  in regards to the hurt feelings of the friendship    You should feel guilty if your actions are purposely malicious and if you want to hurt someone  but from your post that clearly isn't true   There's no "right" way to end a friendship  and it's always better to be honest than to string someone along   Just keep trying to be the best person you can be and remember that that's all you can do   Best of luck and pm me if you ever need to talk more  Yeah  Valuable to who    Really  I had no idea you could do that  Thank you so much  Yes  Your second paragraph   If I had a nickle for every time my kids said I was mean I would be filthy rich   It's starts about age three  I am looking at my three year old son right now haha    I tell him to take his clothes upstairs or put his paw patrol toys away and he doesn't want to    So I follow through with put them away or lose them  temporary   He stomps his feet and says he doesn't like me  I say "Ok "  He does what I ask him and he comes down for dinner or just completed the task  I tell him thank you for doing that   He smiles  I try to make sure I catch him at a good moment soon after he tells me I am mean because he is mad  So I can talk him how much I love him    There is no sense at all to make this a big deal   You can just say  that is not nice either  that would hurt moms feelings    Good night  And just continue on like no big deal     Every time I go out I feel like everyone is staring at me and it makes me feel crowded and causes me to feel panicky and sweat  Therefor I try to avoid it like my life depends on it  No matter how complete you may feel alone  most of us have that hardwired craving to be touched  loved  have sex  etc  Without that for so many years  it does start to feel like something is missing  Im proud of you       As someone who got a 31  i understand not wanting to gloat  The highest my friends got was a 26  it's only going to get worse  don't let yourself get into that position  it fucking sucks  trust me  get yourself sorted and move on in life  don't slowly drown like i have   Sorry as I am not familiar with housing in the UK just wanted to say congrats on your positive attitude about moving forward for now     just keep in mind that your undergraduate major will most likely not affect your life outside of your time in college  unless you want to be an accountant or an engineer or a doctor or something specific along those lines  you can study anything and have the same life   also  i studied something completely unrelated to my future career  and it hasnt hindered me at all  i am going to grad school for a science based profession  and i studied drama in college    worst case scenario  you'll want to go to a graduate school down the line and you'll need classes that you didnt take in college  so what  you just take them at a community college  no biggie   if you dont see more schooling in your future  then you dont need to stress about what you study  enjoy being a student  To yourself  I guess  Do you love yourself  I'm about to go love myself a couple of times before bed  "But I'll always be your friend   " I'm going to link you to a specific episode of a podcast   It's a storytelling podcast   and in it a young woman talks about going through a mental health breakdown  It is a pretty intense story   but I think it is a really valuable one    I am not trying to compare you to her   I just think you may find value in her story    http   www podtrac com pts redirect mp3 traffic libsyn com risk 408   RISK   Live From Philly mp3 dest id 10887   The clearest advice I can give you is   get help   You don't have to ask for permission   You don't have to wait for it to get worse    You can get help today   Get yourself into the hospital   Pick up the phone and call them  There are people that can help you   YES   I've been saying this here  Especially right before Christmas   cutesy couples holding hands  getting professional photos  posting obnoxious shit on Facebook  wedding proposals  buying rings  I can't bear to see it any longer  If I see a cute gay couple  it especially hurts me   I can literally feel my heart actually ache  longing to be loved  I'm a good guy  dammit  If only another guy would notice  Sigh    You don't go out at all  Yeah  Sitting at home certainly makes it worse  but going out in public can be a reminder of loneliness too  It's a whole bag of mixed emotions  Heads up  most people here are not going to be sympathetic  because you were married once  regardless of how it ended  You just are not forever alone  and saddling yourself with that label is only holding you back if you're as cute as you say  Read the stickied threads and the sidebar to get some clue about what this community is for  assuming you aren't just here to stir up some shit  Try  r lonely   r dating advice  etc  Good luck   I often have the same feeling  so thank you for putting it into words   It would be better to live a short quality life than this  Wrong sub What do you mean by overconfident  best clinic for mole removal I was just saying this  Lately I've flipping between an actual physical pain in my heart of sadness and crying  then flipping to an intense  internal rage at the unfairness of it all and seeing happy couples  everywhere   shitpost much  My advice would be to schedule some informational interviews with people in the field you want to work in and see what they did   I have heard having a degree helps  but I have also heard that it isn't really necessary  so it seems to swing both ways   Look  I understand how you feel  I attempted suicide 5 or 6 times when I was 14  I was going through homelessness  living with family I barely knew  family making me feel like shit because I came out as bi  and other things I don't feel like bringing up  I almost died the last time and was institutionalized  After I got over my muck I felt horrible   And like you  fear that I could actually have died is what kept me going  I also struggled with severe depression and anxiety  now controlled but thats another story for another day   You feel guilty and scared as hell  but you learn to manage  You can't undo what you did but you learn from it  I learned that had I died  I admittedly wouldn't have gone through some of the absolute hell I had  But I also wouldn't have gone through some amazing things  met amazing people  and got father in life than I thought at 14    All you can do is move on and carry yourself forward  Learn from the person who hurt you and learn from what you've done  Lifes a messed up educational game  You learn  you fall  you fuck up  you get back up  you dust yourself off  and you move on and repeat and the next time you fall you get back up sooner and smoother   I might not be the best person to give advice but I went through a period where death was what I desired most and I learned from it  I still fall now but it's more of a stumble and I still got plenty of years to go   And if it's of any matter  I'm 19 too   Ya I wasn't thinking straight  kind of panicked at work  As I was clicking out to leave my manager pulled me aside saying I had to get tested  Would have been extremely awkward and suspicious to quit on the spot there but nothing I can do about it now  Might as well delete your reddit account as well  Thank you  I think the reason single dad's are praised more than single mom's is because more men have fled responsibility than women  So  single mom's are more common and than single dad's  That doesn't make it right but  it is the primary reason  I believe  I hope my post inspires those who are able to make those changes within their own communities    but what if you didnt have a job and all you did was stay with the family friend and go to college there  would i be paying any extra    Oh shit you became the annoying friend in this post  making it about yourself  Haha jk jk  Op it takes a lot of guts to break off a toxic friendship  props to you  I guess he didn't live up to his username     lol ask somewhere else  no one here knows shit about dating I have different strategies depending on the emotions and on what is feasible at the time   Strategy 1  if I'm feeling emotional  but can't leave work right at that moment  I find something to focus on  For instance  get some hot tea  It's not only a distraction  but comforting too  Focus on the flavor  on the temperature  on the feel of the cup  Just something to pull you out of your head  Something else that you can try is if you have some work that you need to do which is fun and engaging tell yourself that you are just going to work on it for 10 minutes  even if you really don't feel like it  After 10 minutes  give yourself another 10 minute goal  and so on  Again  it's something to get you out of your head and let the feelings dissipate   Strategy 2   go for a walk  If I can leave work for a bit  and if strategy 1 doesn't work  it helps to get outside  It clears my mind a little by getting into a new setting   Of course walking also gives me time to ruminate on my feelings which can make things worse  So I give myself the first 10 minutes of the walk to ruminate analyze cry whatever  Sometimes I feel better after that 10 minutes  but if not  then I mentally push the situation away  I picture it in my head and imaging a curtain coming across  covering whatever the issue is   I've heard of other people locking their feelings in a box or putting them on a shelf  the curtain thing just seems to come more natural to me  I then use the rest of the walk to focus on the plants  on cars passing by  details of buildings anything to distract  I also think about what fun thing I'm going to do when I get home  Gets me thinking about the future rather than the past  Then when I get home I allow my self to revisit the issue  and do whatever fun thing I had planned   Usually by this time I'm less emotional and can analyze the situation rationally   Strategy 3  again you need to be able to leave work  I treat myself to a nice lunch  I also like to crank the music up while I'm driving and singalong  It's hard to feel sad or anxious when you're singing at the top of your lungs   Strategy 4  works when angry  I run  sprint  as far and fast as a can until it feels like my legs are going to give out  I don't run often so this doesn't take long  and then I force myself to keep running at a slower pace  Basically  it's hard to feel too bad when the endorphins are flowing and you are physically exhausted   So in short  exercise and distraction are the methods that I use  Good luck  I hope that you find a strategy that works for you  Self discipline is hard  Before starting a project  pump the brakes and outline all the steps  Write down a timeline and steps  No matter what you do you won't commit to change unless you want it  You have to want bad energy ugh to change your lifestyle  What usually happens to make you lose interest  I appreciate the reply TomorrowWendy  but I'd be seriously remiss to call myself a hero    I'd agree that being courageous  at first  disrespecting Andrew was hands down the most disgusting thing I've ever done  puts you at odds with the world though  There was reluctance by both my brothers and their respective wives to take the leap  We recognized there would be consequences  I knew I would be blamed for the situation  that I would take some serious heat for blowing the whistle  and I did    What I didn't expect was for Amy to come on to me  That came at a time when I was weak  nearly a shell of my former self  It doesn't make up for the fact I didn't stop her and reciprocated  that my own needs trumped my families well being even if just temporarily  To say I made a mistake is a colossal understatement    I'm not sure how common my gaffe is  Of course instances of infidelity are a dime a dozen  but for it to be my own brother that I cheat  I wish I could say it's possible to understand  but I don't think so  I loved him so much  I would have given everything to him if he asked  How I could lose sight of that is unforgivable    I'm still very scared of what lay ahead  I haven't been able to shake the feelings of self hatred and zero self worth  I have realized however that doing anything without first making amends with Andrew isn't right  Amy and I lied right to his face  at least one person has to look him in the eye and tell the honest truth    If it were that easy for her to act out with her brother in law what would stop her from doing it again  He has to know that this wasn't me being predatory  that there were two performers in this act  He has to know that his wife of only 6 months can't be trusted  just the same way he can't trust me  I'm not looking for revenge on her  just for accountability   I'll make it through this  only because time doesn't stand still  Life goes on  reluctant or disconnected as we may be  Reality is that the life I had is gone  nothing I will know will be anything like what I knew  Whether that is something I can adjust to or not is another ball game  probably for a therapist and I to play    I do appreciate the kind words Wendy  it means a lot to have someone at least try to understand me   50 in 07 Don't forget showering  I get where you're coming from  but this really isn't the sub for you  First of all Thank you for your answer I really apreciate that   No I am not going into debt since all universities are basicly free  in Germany but life in general is quite expensive  Rent  food  etc   luckily my parents support me   Well probably I will apply for a few different courses starting autum this year in order to be free to choose when time comes   You didnt mention it explicitly but I assume that you think that I should look into Moving Back  am I right  I adopted an eight year old rat terrier who is now fifteen and is the perfect apartment dog  Very loving and affectionate couch potato   Im so sorry  You can message me if you want  My boyfriend went through something almost exactly like that    Its ok to feel sad  Pissed  All those things you feel  But  YOU ARE NOT WORTHLESS  You survived  Those types of people are sick  sick  sick  and are incredibly cowardly to do those things  You have done absolutely nothing wrong  You are a wonderful and complex person  and are so much more than that terrible experience    Much love  Totally relate  I'm 32 and went to my brother's wedding recently  All the attendees were couples or married already  I was a groomsman  and although the ceremony was "cute"  I had to fight tears    Not because of the sentiment of the wedding  but of going back to my empty  cold hotel room for 3 nights   And what's with the public proposal shit  I would want to do that in private if it were me  It's an emotional time between two people   the whole fucking restaurant and family doesn't need to see it  putting pressure on the person to say "yes"  People need a little more modesty with their PDA  I'm an engineer  not that smart but hard to replace so they keep me around What you may actually be attempting to describe is probably arrogance or stubborness There is no actual such thing  or attitude  which may properly be termed as "over confidence"  The two actually appropriate terms to may be "arrogant" or stubborn"   The term "over confident" seems to suggest that a person has  too much   confidence   However  people who are arrogant  or stubborn  are people coping  or over compensating  for personal insecurities  Stubbornness is not the same persistence  Stubbornness is rather self detrimental  Persistence is a constructive quality or a "good" quality"   I suppose that the question to answer is  Are you intimidated by her confidence  or is she essentially an arrogant or stubborn person  If so  what is the cause or reason for that  Talk to a therapist about your rights  The drop thing is rediculous  Academic probation  Its high school  for christs sake    Edit  fellow adhder do it  Thank you so much for sharing I am willing to try and anything and will definetely go for it   That's sweet of you If you don't smoke at all you could volunteer for blood test for nicotine  Education is important tbh Bit hard to give advice without knowing much about you but I would say try to do things you enjoy and be confident about being yourself and don't worry about what others may think  I know its easier said than done but this will hopeful put you around people with similar interests and being open and confident with yourself will draw people to you who are similar to you  Hope this helps Because as human males we sometimes need the acceptance or love from woman to feel human    When I have an episode like the one I described it does impact me as I do get rather violently ill  Can you tell me about this         Also  do you feel that you go with the flow  or you are a bit of a perfectionist         Lastly  what about the 'after I'm dead' disturbs you the most  Well  take it easy on yourself because this is all pretty new and a lot for anyone to digest  It's possible your folks said their words in the heat of the moment and maybe they'll feel differently with some time passing  That said  you're going to have to live in day tight compartments for the foreseeable future  as looking too far ahead has become a source of much anguish for you  Focus on taking each day as it comes and this whole scenario will be a lot easier to deal with  Your love for your parents shines through in your post here  Good luck and don't be so hard on yourself  Life has a way of working itself out  Ok so when this all happened I didn't get a chance myself to get the guys insurance  The cop at the scene got it for me  On the police report the officer put that the guy presented valid insurance  But when I called they guys insurance they said his police had been expired since January  I have his address and all info over him on the police report   Me too  It's the FA  When I have gone on a date in the distant past or have a prospect  my whole world lights up  I get chores and hobbies done and feel energetic and peaceful  It's a good feeling to feel romantically sexually desired   When there's no dates to look forward to  who's gonna care if my house is unvacuumed for 2 weeks  my projects aren't started  or I'm eating frozen pizzas every night  No one  Instead  my time is spent in bed  surfing online  and not getting shit done  Dam i live in RDP wish I saw this sooner    haha yes if youre not setting yourself up for wasted debt  which i now know youre not doing   then for sure i would move home if i were in your position  theres no compelling reason to stay where you are   I had that surgery as a teen and remember having the same concern  Just go  Here is a secret about adults and everyone else in your life  No matter your age you never feel like an adult  Confidence and certainty never just one day happen  Everyone is unsure of themselves and no one really knows what they are doing  We are all just faking it till we make it  Confidence is built when you focus on gaining experiences  You become confident in something by experiencing something  Anxiety comes from behind hit afraid of the unknown  If you are worried about how your actions are perceived by others  it's because you are considering doing something saying something that you feel is out of character or new  It something you need to do to be comfortable doing it  Try and think about something that makes you nervous or just try something new every week  Go somewhere you've never been do something you've never do  The first steps are the hardest  but what have you got to lose   I read posts at  r  howtonotgiveafuck sometimes for inspiration about getting over what other people think of you  Hang in there OP  opportunities are coming Seek that therapy  She needs to talk to someone  Maybe she has some sort of compulsion disorder that's coming out this way  Whatever it is  it isn't right  She needs to see someone to make sure it's not medical  This is some seriously toxic shit and something that you probably will not be able to deal with all on your own  There also may be options out there to help make any treatment affordable or free  You'll just have to check in your area  Good luck  I really hope things get better for you guys  How  you  doin'  I'd actually put it at an equal probability of me winning the lottery and me getting into a relationship  If I win the lottery and become a millionare  I'm sure a girl would lie about liking me to be with my money  Humor shares a common ground and culture  If there is not much common ground  very few jokes will be enjoyed  Similarly you wouldn't find the jokes the pc people around you make funny  Good for you  I know what you mean about the bragging thing   Glad you could tell us   So proud for you     Now just prepare yourself for the mountain of mail you'll now be getting from colleges    There are a lot of things people say to this kind of thing that don't seem like they make a difference to me    "Please don't" "Things will get better" "Imagine everything you'll miss out on" "Think about your loved ones"  Trying to find the right thing to say is a lot harder  I certainly don't know what that right thing is  But I can say  reddit can be a great place to find support when you're all alone  I hope you don't follow through with your plan  I hope that you find peace in this crazy dark world  I hope that you do more than simply live  that happiness and love find their way to you    I will be keeping you in my thoughts  and sending good vibes to the universe for you  When it is too hard to hope that things get better or believe that they will on your own behalf  know that there is someone else out there hoping and believing that for you  thanks   The alternative is probably not feeding the trolls  Downvote  report  move on  Walk in tne room  Keep your posture straight  head straight up  Give a culturally appropriate smile when entering  Acknowledge there are others in the room   Good response   You need new friends   r Reno would be a better place to ask This is awesome  You totally have bragging rights  I'm so happy for you  I feel you  The human mind is awful sometimes  You just need to remember that these fetishes don't define you in any way and that a lottt of people go through them   When you dont want your one friend to get a girlfriend cuz then you know you'll never see him again  True  at least he has someone to call  If confidence and certainty never just one day happen  then how did it those couple of days  I felt so good about myself and I didn't let anything bother me  Not to mention one of the days I was at the gym  but only for about 10 minutes at school       Also  Im usually afraid of how my actions are perceived by others because I don't usually act towards adults and such how I act with my close friends  I feel like if I act usual  they will think different of me  and I don't know if that different will be good or bad  I just feel like it's too late to change that much of me  because none of them have seen that side of me   I make offensive jokes while sober  Is this a joke  Find a super cheap outdoor rug and give it as a late christmas present  while heavily hinting about the toys   while I do agree  there are few that seem so masochistically self destructive as this  I've had the feelings myself at times and honestly I'd rather be into kiddie porn then feel those awful  almost evil  feelings  Why Did You Capitalize Every Word In The Title  BROOOOOO HOMEGIRLLL Fucking congrats seriously all the hard work and time you put into preparing for this really payed off  I'm really happy for you stranger  Smiles and internet hugs for you dude  Take the upvote if it means anything to ya  D Eitherway good job person  you just took one of the first steps to living the life you envisioned for yourself Yeah  I am working on it  Its just that I have to see this person everyday and I'm sick of her interrogating me about my weekends then bragging about hers  I think she leaves me out just so she can one up me  You say you never had any family  does this mean you were raised in the foster care system  If so  it would make sense as to why it sounds like you may have trouble forming attachments  Therapy could be an effective tool for you  Even if I'm wrong a good therapist could really help you in learning and practicing these skills

what the alternative would have been   In your classes  you have a self selected group of keeners that are looking for a more challenging program for their last two years of high school   You've got more engaged peers  and a faster pace of teaching than regular public school class  and no problem kids creating distraction    The program creates an environment where you're surrounded by smart  ambitious people  and then it's up to you to make the most of your time there     Tokyo  It's fun and I really do enjoy my life here     G did get inside  I texted her cousin who lives at the house

University GPA  High school is basically ignored   Yeah it's definitely not for everyone but I'm just throwing it out there I admitted to my big mistake  dealt with the consequences  and worked my butt off to rectify the situation  I live with it  You can't forget  even if you want to I relate a lot to this as well  generally common with an anxious mind I believe    I think this may be helpful when it's irrelevant anxious thoughts that are just rehash of embarrassing insignificant moments  however I find I also tend to worry about an unresolved conflict with a significant other  which for me tends to involves long term potential    so      U wot m8  He has several patents to his name This one is Fuck Feelings    is this what you were referring to  http   www goodreads com book show

skip it next time   I know exactly what its like  I'm not so bad now  It may be different for you but I found that it all came down to me being self conscious about myself and not even realizing that i think too much about what people are thinking  I would think too much about what I was saying and get muddled up  I still do in stressful situations   Its not something you can fix overnight but just remember that this happens to everyone at some stage  Just try to relax and be confident with who you really are and what you are doing  You don't need to validate yourself to others  Then you don't have to think about what your saying and it just works   Hope this helps  I think it means that radical self acceptance lets people have access to a bigger  more interesting version of their

College  I think in general it's overrated  So true it hurts So what you're saying is you plan to attend college in Florida and live there for most of the year  They will quickly turn you down because the Florida Board of Ed specifically states that they review every person on a case by case basis and won't give you residency because you go to school there  I know this works for others in the Midwest and the East  but Florida is much more strict  I really don't know how "unfair" it is though  Yin must have yang   Either way it kills me seeing something I like and fractions of a moment later being hit by the realization of inevitably never achieving  Cut her off completely l  When you see her at work make very small talk if any  Try and slowly break away from her  Or you could just jump straight to the point and tell her to leave you alone and block her on social media  I personally would just slowly cut her off so there's no bad blood at work  This may not be the sub for you  Nobody at a medical school would ever see or care about what you did in 10th grade  Method for this   Using the national cohort study from the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service  1 4 matched  age  sex  income  region  and pre operative URI visit  tonsillectomy participants  5 831  and control participants  23 324  were selected  Post operative visits for URI were measured from 1 to 9 years post op  The equivalence test was used  The margin of equivalence of the difference  TonsillectomyControl group group  was set to  0 5 to 0 5    Wow these are wonderful tips thank you  I'm actually working remotely at the moment so typically have more freedom to try these  but when I get back to the office these disaggregations will be helpful    I love your idea about mindful tea drinking  as well as the mindful walking after you've let out any necessary tears analysis rumination  I will definitely try this  it reminds me a lot of meditation but the tangibility of it makes it sound much more effective    thank you    I also often use the pomodoro strategy to get started but sometimes my emotions still get in the way    but you're right 10 mins doesn't sound too much at all  Maybe I"ll shorten the time      Haha strategy 3 sounds amazing too    I already have a few songs in mind      To be honest I haven't had a good work out in over a year  Another thread I cross posted to also recommended this  so thank you for the reminder    I used to competitively sprint in grade school    might get back to it    Thanks so much  These were some of the most practical and theoretically helpful tips I've read so far  I will definitely be trying some of these     thank you   Tell them  If they don't like it do it anyways  You're not a child anymore and from my understanding they don't support you financially  so it's not like they can stop you  Tell them about the money you'll save  etc  Don't try and help a depressed person if you don't know how to handle the situation    Often  people with depression don't want you to tell them to face an issue head on  They just want to get their troubles off their chest as a form of catharthis  It can be draining if you're trying to console him her by saying things like "it always gets better" because no depressed person cares to hear that    I wish you the best with your own problems  Mental health issues suck  Hey  no problem    I was a teenager once  too   I'm 24 now  I grew up on tough love and as far as my research goes it's a contributor to why I hate myself this much no matter what I do or don't do  That voice is stuck in my head and I don't feel like I'll ever be good enough for     i don't even know what for   what about in highschool  Yeah you're right  It sucks too because I went through similar things op went through but its kinda like they didn't want to hear take notice of the advice but rather look for a reason fault in it  Can't say I blame op everyone is different it just kind of saddens frustrates me  Mental heath issues fuckin blow indeed  Thanks for consoling words kind stranger  best of luck with your issues as well friend   No problem  all teenagers need to hear this  They need a reminder that they're not alone  and if they don't think they're normal  great news  NO ONE as a teenager thinks they are   r stopgaming Never been  but have you looked at  r PuertoRicoTravel    r PuertoRico   and or  r travel   I'm sure they can help as well  Remember that conversation has too functions  Talking and listening   Ask questions you genuinely want to know or are interested in about this person   Listen and try to remember   People can go on and on about themselves sometimes and they may appreciate that you are taking an interest in them   You can use a situation to have a conversation   Lets say you meet girl in the supermarket and you see the contents in her cart   You can say  "Are you making lasagne   You better save me a plate " with a smile   The both of you can have a quick 1 minute conversation about food or even visiting Italy one day   If you run out of stuff to say and the both of you hit it off  ask for contact info then leave   If she gives it to you  cool  if not  don't worry about it   Don't worry about what to say  but let the situation allow you to have a conversation  That's a good idea  thank you  I think the stigma here is that couples who don't have children should be able to solve their own money problems if they don't have addictions or crippling debt  I'm sorry you are struggling and have struggled for so long  I hope that your gofundme page gets more donations  Yup and it really works I dunno why  but this made me laugh  Thanks for that  Degrees help for sure  but you can get into communications without one  Sometimes it's about who you know  And that's a different issue in itself  What kind of job are you looking to get  If you're looking to work at a news station as  let's say  an editor  then it's a good idea to go shoot and edit your own stuff in your spare time  This is sometimes more powerful than a degree because they want people who can do the job and have proof of that  Figure out what it is you want to do  and start doing it now and get good  Then start searching for jobs    Source  got hired at a medium market news station as a promotions producer at 19  less than a year after graduating high school  still there now  What got me the interview  though  was who I knew  Make friends in the field and it will be much easier to land that interview  It shouldn't be that way but it is  But it's not impossible to make that happen and or get around that  The key is to develop your skills  Because in this industry they care more about seeing what you can do  Anything about communications that you'll learn in school  you can learn online  for free     Good luck  I hope this helps a bit    Edit  also just wanted to say fuck what other people are saying  They don't have it figured out either  You do what makes you happy OP  They won't be the ones paying your bills or living your life  TRUE They want you  but with a good body  Godspeed and good luck   YOU GOT THIS  Because they care Same  I had a single Mom  My Father abandoned me when I was 5 so I only had my Mom and older Sister who would constantly bully me  My Mom said it was out of "tough love" but I still have self esteem issues that I can directly connect to her bullying  I'm sorry I can't "man up" and get over it like that therapist said   Yes  I suppose     lmao congrats Currently I'm going to school and when classmates start talking about their relationships I long for sweet death to finally take me can relate to you OP  I agree with these people about counseling  but for now  have you made a video  Wouldn't help your wife's problem much  but might help yours  I have been through this THREE times in my life  and I'm a 31 year old Engineer  I can think of a few things  This last time I was given a Career Coach as part of my package  and it was the VERY best thing that ever happened to me  She rewrote my resume to the point where I gave it to a recruiter and he found me multiple interviews and 2 of them offered me a job  Go to your unemployment office  There are people there who rewrite resumes for a living  The criticism can be harsh  but taking their advice is the best thing I ever did  Now the main thing I did EVERY DAY but Sunday    I applied to THREE JOBS every day  If you do this you are doing your part and everything else will fall into place  I kept a PDF print of each job so if someone called me I could quickly pull it up  I had an excel chart that detailed each job title  location  date I applied  any website passwords  etc  Once you do 3 jobs a day  focus on some of these other things people are listing  the gym etc   You will feel better knowing you are pulling your fair weight to get a job  And 3 is a proven number the career coach will tell you about  Hang in there     this makes you even more FA than me  and i didn't even think that was possible   because i wouldn't even notice if this sub dissapeared I'm really sorry for your lost    Excellent suggestion  I'll do that  i dont even think my mom wished my happy new year  but to be fair i totally forgot it was my sis birthday Yeah  when one is depressed he or she doesn't care to look at the problem optimistically and prefers to find fault in it as you stated  Your frustration is understandable  just be sure to be delicate in the future    Have a happy new year   "I'm cute  and full of confidence  what do "  pick up a pencil  a pen  a paintbrush  you might be surprised by what you can do   or pick up your phone  go out and take pictures of things you like  try to take them from a completely different perspective   let creativity be your friend  let it inspire you  let your emotions come out in the pieces you do   if you have any free museums near you  visit them  some art galleries and city buildings are also free to visit  learn something there   i was unemployed for about four months  i quit my full time job due to constantly being harassed verbally by my coworkers  and having a management team who couldn't give a shit  i can't say i understand your exact situation  as i was living with my mum at the time    that nothingness isn't sappy or anything  it's a void that can take over your life  i spent most of my days laying in bed  staring at the wall  or sitting in my bathroom alone  that became my world  the days where i turned myself to art  those days i felt alive  i didn't have the energy most days  but those days made it worth it    i am sorry that things have gone to shit for you  keep searching for work  even consider something you've never tried before  you might be surprised how you may qualify   this is coming from someone who is one of the only people on the team without a degree  but hired because of my passion and attitude   go into any interview feeling confident  i don't care if you don't feel confident  fake that shit  get some good mood tunes blasting in your vehicle before the interview  be prepared with a copy of your resume  don't be afraid to go into the interview with notes or questions you have about the place of employment   ask  questions  ask damn good ones  too  there was a recent thread on reddit about the best questions you can ask in an interview  ask them    and last of all  don't forget  it's not the end of the world  it's time for a new start and you can seize the motherfuckin' day   I have for sure  I am not seeing any other option at this point  I am not totally sure what kind of therapist though because I don't know how to classify my problem  This is hard  It happens to many but I think its different for everyone  For me it took years and a series of events for me to be more confident with myself  I will share a few things which I hope will help as it seems you have looked a lot and found a lot of the basic coping techniques   As you know it basically comes down to accepting who you are and not caring what other people think because what you think other people are thinking about you is normally not even close to reality  This however is hard to just stop doing overnight as we all know   You need to find ways of realizing you are actually as good or better then others  For me that was finding my passions and pursuing them and the realization that the majority of other people are just as insecure as I am but they are better at hiding it    I also think that we think we know how others are perceiving us which is not true  Most people will think of you as a lot better or more normal then how you see your self and the same goes for how we see others  Generally we see them with very few flaws but they see themselves as being inadequate but the ones who don't show it are the ones who don't really care so much  They still feel inadequate and may not talk to you because they are actually think you are more mature normal intelligent cool wateva   Also if people say you are socially awkward in a condescending way its most likely because they are trying to bring you down because they are insecure about themselves    To sum up you are better then you think  Work on doing what makes you happy and you will be a better self  You don't come across nearly as bad as you think you do  Your still young and growing so don't beat yourself up too much    Hope this mess of words in a poor writing structure helps in some way   Happy 2017    We don't go outside   literally speaking  normies have no idea All of the congratulations   Im finally going to party  i thought it was gonna be suicide lmao who fucking cares about women men  i just wanna be a normie   Well welcome to this sub   LMAOO   Because as human males we sometimes need the acceptance or love from woman to feel human   i'm a biological FA woman and this almost makes me glad i'm not male  after reading so much from the internet  i realize men are so weak when it comes to women or sex  i don't even care about that me since 12  i'm 23 now ugh   Yeah either quit drinking or just drink a whole lot less  I know it's fun to get wasted at parties  but luckily for me I just get super slow and not all hyper like some others  I say stupid shit but I don't go crazy  What did you say that made him uncomfortable while he was puking drunk  Kind of odd if he was that wasted that something struck deep   This post has been removed    r Health does not allow images  screenshot and other

you  man  and Happy New Year  I convinced my mum YEARS ago to quit when I told her about second hand smoke and that if she'd continue she'd put my life in a lot of danger  I was like 9 years old at the time lol   Sometimes parents won't quit for themselves but for you  Gather some info  tell her how she's effecting her environment and go from there   Definitely  I was just frustrated someone who claimed to care about me would say this  The worst is when you text out happy new year to your Facebook contacts and get no response  That's not your decision to make  It's up to her  She is the one to decide  If you have feelings  and you have to tell her  go ahead  The worst is she'll say no  I cannot thank you enough for explaining that to me  It seriously baffled me as to why they are highly praised  I completely agree with you  Your post sends out a positive message of change  thank you for sharing it  Maybe consider reposting it in other subReddits to inspire more people    take care and happy new year they dont even care Uh in my opinion  kiddie porn is a hell of a lot more awful and evil than being into a cuckold fantasy   It does not matter how others view you  This guy physically assaulted you  it doesn't matter if it ruins there relationship  I would talk to your cousin  And stand your ground  This is what happened  This is how I reacted and this is how I felt  I hope everything goes well   I'm talking about high school  Good idea  I'll use that as one of my reasons to her  But there's once problem  I'm going to be moving out in about a year and a half with friends to college  I guess I will have to convince her to quit permanently  She is very resilient and stubborn  so this will be hard but I'm going to try my best   I weened myself off of Norco  which is similar to Oxycontin  after back surgery  At first I was taking around 40 mg per day  and I tapered it off to 5 mg over the course of some weeks  Then I thought 5 mg wasn't much  so it was probably time to stop   I was at work  and I started feeling pain all over my body  kind of like when you get the flu and all your muscles ache  Except my skin hurt too  Then I started feeling super antsy  like I just wanted to get up and do something physical and possibly a little violent  like sparring   Finally I remembered about the Norco  went home for lunch and took 2 5 mg  which I thought would do nothing  But it calmed me down pretty fast  and after that I didn't need it anymore   I'm fortunate that it doesn't do anything for me besides relieve pain  though  One time I got a shot of morphine in the hospital  and that was the most lovely feeling in the world  like  that scene in Breaking Bad where Jesse gets his first taste of heroin  https   www youtube com watch v Ri0cifENxm0   I still remember it decades later  Norco just stops the pain and makes me feel dull  no fun at all  plus there's the constipation  so it's easy to kick  r nocontext You too brother  have a good and appreciate the advice   talk to the teacher and tell her how you feel  if you are dismissed  or if another incident takes place  talk to the teachers' boss  aka the principal   you should be able to talk to your teacher about such things without fear of repercussion  that is her job  if she isn't doing a good job  then her boss needs to know  First  please stop beating yourself up for your immediate reaction to this assault  You did nothing wrong here and don't deserve to be tortured over the fact that you froze rather than speaking up immediately    Is your assessment of how your family might react based on their reactions to your prior abuse  I suspect they may not react as poorly as you believe  but you know your family better than an Internet stranger  obviously    I would suggest approaching one member of your family that you trust to believe you and to  make your safety  physical and emotional  their top priority  Tell them about the incident and get their advice as an interested party who knows the players involved    I'm sorry this happened to you  I'm also sorry that I don't have better advice for you  but I hope that it helps to know there is at least one person out here who is thinking of and praying for you   Very much so the same for me    i was speaking about evil in terms of self destructiveness  inwardly evil  i got almost two months off from school after fall quarter  classes start on tuesday for me  of course im working on my BAS but i too have to get back on track with a sleep schedule   best thing that works for me is making "to do" lists of assignments for that week only  dont try and cram everything in  just focus on that week  if your teacher doesnt have everything planned out for that week  shes a terrible teacher  you could ask her if you might be able to have a calendar or something   for getting yourself back on track with sleep schedule try  drinking a glass of  room temp water  hot warm is always the best for me  very soothing  about 10 15 mins before bed  it will help get your body relaxed and cozy   do some deep breathing  dosnt have to be a lot either  just 4 6 DEEP breaths  and slowly let it out   again the key is to relax   lastly  i get so caught up on shit  seriously i worry too much sometimes about the dumbest shit  Let it go and tell your body its time to rest and tomorrow is a new day  FRESH

left   Are you American  Dude don't even worry about it  It's a fantasy for a reason  If it were anything real  Then it wouldn't be a FANTASY  Everybody has something they think is embarrassing  but what you are experiencing is one of the most common fetishes in existence  I'm not saying to go through with it  personally I like to keep my fantasies separate from my actual love life  but you have to just accept that what's in your mind is in YOUR mind  Nobody else will ever know about it but you  And it's not a big deal  You have to understand that it's not a big deal at all  If your not comfortable with sharing the fantasy with your S O  then don't  let it remain as it is  But don't contemplate suicide because you think you are fucked up for having such a fantasy  like come on dude  There is nothing wrong with you   "OxyContin is a chemical cousin of heroin"  Ugh   Where do people come up with this   Heroin is diacetyl morphine  OxyContin is Oxycodone   They are like apples and oranges  If you are not able to diet or exercise to lose all the weight  you should opt for weight loss surgery  In Southern California  I'm conflicted  because as someone who is fairly awkward and overly self conscious it lets me be the kind of person I wish came naturally to me  but then I do things that I can't take back  This is the first time I've really felt the weight of potential consequences that one night of drinking can have on your life   It's also the first time you've allowed yourself to get this drunk  no  For most people  there's the "happy drunk" stage  which gives way to the "somewhat desperate  impulsive drunk" stage  which can progress to the "pitiful nightmare drunk" stage  The key to holding your booze is to never allow yourself to progress past happy drunk  I know it can be tempting to try to get a little looser  but it rarely works out for the best  You've now experienced significant consequences from drinking to excess  so hopefully you will be able to moderate your behaviour better next time    I HATE THAT I CAN'T BE SOCIAL AND FUN TO BE AROUND WITHOUT ALCOHOL BUT IN THE END IT BITES ME IN THE ASS AND RUINS MY FRIENDSHIPS   In my experience  alcohol isn't usually the only ingredient in this phenomenon  At best  alcohol is going to cause generalised disinhibition  You might feel a bit happier for a short period  After this period  your brain will adjust  You will no longer feel so happy  you will just have more difficulty controlling your impulses  Whether this works out for you will depend on other factors  like your existing social skills  the people around you  and how you are dealing with the stress in your life  If these things are going badly  then drinking probably won't help you socialise  To the contrary  it will likely make things worse    Alcohol is such an ingrained part of the culture that I'm going to be faced with the pressure of drinking all the time  I was promising myself that I was going to put myself out there this semester  but realistically that doesn't involve me not being a part of the party scene  I don't know what to do   I'm not part of the party scene  but do other people even know how much you are drinking  The problem with being a drunk is that if you don't have people looking out for you  you're fucked  As a man  no one is going to hold your hair and stroke your back while you vomit  No one is going to encourage you to get sexual  unless it's to laugh at you  If you're going to party  you need to be able to take care of yourself  You probably won't be able to do this if you get wasted all the time  or if you're prone to depression because of a shitty lifestyle  To put it another way  maybe partying only once a week and drinking in moderation is all most of us are cut out for   I'd say that for every guy who does cool shit when drunk  there are 10 more who wake up in a pile of vomit with humiliating flashbacks  Come join us at r financialindependence  You have the

have been so blind   Thanks for the reply  We work pretty close so I don't want to screw that up but I have tried gradually not talking and only socializing with other people at work and walking away before she could start  Worked well but then I think she was feeling jealous so she started being friendly again and now were back here again   I can't cut her off completely as we work together on occasions but I can get her far enough away to be happy  I'm just not sure what to do when she starts bragging about how great her life is and then downplaying mine  Do I try and play up my life as she is doing or just be really vague or something else  i don't know     Hmm  this sounds like a very tricky situation  First off  I'm sorry this and previous instances happened to you  and I hope it doesn't happen again   I would say that this isn't something that should be kept secret  I guess it really depends on how your family would take it  and from what you've said  it sounds like they really care about you  If they already know about the previous instances  maybe they would be more understanding   I guess trying to think more on the strategy side of things  it's like  if you appeared to your family to already have something against him or your cousin  they'd think more that you were just trying to break them apart and ruin them  I wouldn't know  but it sounds like this isn't the case and that he was fine up until this point  I assume it would come as a shock to your family to hear  but I don't think they would just assume you were lying  Of course  this is up to you to judge  If they really care about you  especially more than them  they should do the right thing  try posting this in  r lonely  this sub is mostly for people who have never been in a relationship

wouldn't get us anywhere either  and then we'd have no outlet for our feelings  Glad I could help   I know its hard to truly believe but trust me it really is   I was like you when I was 14  I'm now 23  Its not easy and will take time and persistence but you will get there if you believe in yourself and don't stop trying        The limiting of the stomachs capacity means less intake   I'll share a bit of my experience    I'm twenty two  well  I will be on the fifth  and have suffered depression  partly spurred on by an abusive brother  since I was about 8 years old  I started cutting when I was twelve and My first suicide attempt was when I was 13  and I've tried so many times since then that I've lost count  I've been hospitalized in psych wards at least thirty times  and even recently spent some time in a mental hospital  I've only in the past year regained my will to live  From what I've learned through all of this is this  those thoughts  thoughts that you'd be better off dead  thoughts that everyone is better off without you  thoughts of hurting yourself  they're just that  thoughts  You don't have to act on them  They may never go away and you just have to live with them  but the more you ignore them  the less persistent they become   Are you serious dude  Seriously maybe just don't jack off in front of her  If she is literally making you just jerk off until your dick hurts then you should leave that relationship  You know what would happen if I tried to make my girl do ANYTHING that caused her repeated discomfort  She'd leave my ass and rightfully so  I mean honestly dude the answer is right in front of your eyes  I mean come on  If she tries to MAKE you jack off in front of her  well that's just fucking weird   Thank you so much   Not american  but two

touched on it there  but I'll say it again  Volunteering  It keeps you productive  gives you opportunity to put skills to use  gives you some much needed networking opportunity   Most importantly  it keeps you from lolling around the house and gets you up in the morning to go act like a professional  and stops you having a big ugly gap on your resume  Makes you look a lot more legit as a prospect   complete  well  in the literal sense  valuable  LOL no My first sentiment is     its tough to counsel and that's why people get paid to do it    Also as someone who actually just started therapy today    that kid knows what he should be doing  He just has a mental block into actually doing it    It's best with these things to lead a horse to water but let them make their own plan    i e  how would you foresee fixing this obvious issue and leading the conversation in that direction   Its hard to tell     i would keep consistent and not treat them any different just because they aren't 'returning the favour' yet  It could be as simple as them being busy   we should never assume   Also  try and look at it in terms of 'abundance'  you should be happy to see them but if it doesn't happen you should always have other options  If people feel like your desperate or they are your only option they might be a bit reluctant to go too far out of their way for you   Put yourself out there more  go to social events like music  bars  extend your social circles  it might seem really hard at first but even in a small town its quite easy once you get some momentum   Dont make these people your priority  you need to have a passion  something that makes your eyes light up when people ask you about it  Thats what excites people  people are drawn to seeing someone who is self driven and not dependant on what they can offer you   Another thing worth mentioning is some people are just like that  one of my best friends  10 years    never calls  never asks me to hang out ect  However he is more than happy for me to show up un announced at his house and that is what happens 90  of the time   For  along time this did bother me and i looked inward thinking i wasn't that fun to be around  over time i've accepted thats just the dynamic of our relationship    Funny thing is  this guy grew up on a small farm   maybe there is a connection there with independence or something   Regardless  its always a good idea to make more varied friends  who knows you might find someone who actually ends up pestering you everyday and think to yourself "gee  why can't they just leave me alone sometimes and wait until i contact them "  Irony       Ahh ok well I don't know if you have an option for GED or equivalent where you are  If you do you could look into something like that  Regarding high school  I 100  say complete it  Maybe take easier classes if you can  Just tell her the truth  You have no need to try and impress her   There is also a fair chance that they are intimidated by you  Your body language and words can be a lot more powerful in social situations then physical size or gender  I know girls who are tiny and no one will mess with them just because of their personality and body language  They are analogues with a similar chemical structure   Oxycodone a more basic structure   They are also both opiates and behave similarly in vivo    Thanks Had a similar issue with a girl man  sadly she said no to me but I look back on it now and I realized that I just waited for too long  If I had only asked her out sooner I know she would have said yes  but I waited and ended up in the friend zone  Fuck it  ask her out  Live with no regrets  Plus  you're in 10th grade  if she for some reason says no  you have a whole life ahead of you full of girls  Yes  just like there are "sunday football players" there are "sunday prostitutes" who are mostly housewives or single mothers who earn some extra cash on the side during the weekend or when husband is away  I haven't actually been to any  but the descriptions of how sex was sounded so much hotter and organic  Thanks  I'll do it  I think if you can find a way  perhaps some professional opinion  to confirm or deny your doubts  you should try that  Maybe a talk with a psychologist or something  Maybe a serious discussion with your husband would also be called for  but I'm not sure  Sorry if this wasn't very helpful  tbh i think swiping right on everyone will only lead to more rejections I would just stay up all night and tomorrow go to sleep around midnight and wake up at 10   Thanks for your advice man  Any and all thoughts towards this helps me kinda just make sense of it all  I actually have no idea what I said to him  and he wouldn't say either when I asked  I too was wondering what it was  I don't know if physically I was "horsing around" and he wasn't in the mood  puking his brains out   or if I said something that struck him negatively   He is my best friend  and I would never do anything like this sober  But it's not an excuse  and I have to change something if I want him to forgive me fully  I know if I don't change  that's when you lose friends family  It was more of a disappointment in me  and it really hit me hard when he told me it was like dealing with a stranger  and I wasn't acting like me at all   All I can hope for is that he sees this change and will take note I am not going to let it happen again   Okay one last question  what so you think about the comparision between old and new Home simply not beeing fair  I mean everytime I am visiting my hometown I dont have to persue my normal student working life while having a great time compared to persuing a stressfull but normal student life  Point is life might be just the same way if I move home since I would start to study there  Thank you so much  Thank you very much  3 Yes  it is because of a reaction I received in the past when telling someone about what happened  but not with family  I do hope you're right that they would react well   Your advice and kind words mean so much to me  thank you  3 I don't think you should worry about it that much    Honestly  the depth and self awareness that you have just pointed out is well beyond your years   High school is a hard time for most  and the people that breeze through that period of their life often peak way too early   Your still growing and learning every day  don't beat yourself up because you feel like your not the same as your peers   In my experience   myself included  those who are alienated in school often have a much larger potential  It sounds like your mentally mature for your age   You are putting in effort to better and self improve yourself at a young age which is definitely a sign of good things to come    Just be yourself and don't define yourself based on how your peers see you  You will catch up and overtake them soon enough with that attitude   when you were in that mind state  you had let go of everyone else judgement and you were truly yourself  But slowly everyones expectations of you caught back up with you    you just had a glimpse into how life should be  now go out and find it again  Hello  I'm not a trained professional  but I'm 27 and have the same problems   I suffer from social anxiety and it's pretty manageable when you learn a few tricks   I'm not saying that's what you have  but it sounds like it   I just tell myself that at the end of the day even if someone is judging me which 99 100 times they aren't  but I understand how you feel like they are  that it doesn't matter  You will still go about your business and be happy doing your thing   If they are judging you then chances are they are just compensating for one of their own problems so don't let it become an issue in your head   You just have to become aware of what triggers your anxiety and find a way to counteract it  Every situation will be different  but once you identify the problem it will be a whole lot easier  Keep your head up    Confidence    It definitely makes the best difference  The problem is that when we are FA  we have nothing to feed our confidence  So we have to kickstart the circle by faking confidence before it becomes natural  It's a paradox  But that's how girls work  Holy shit  I wish people could pay me to bully them for 10 to 15 minutes for  50  I would happily do it  I'm confident that it does exist  That's a good assessment  I think realistically  most of my family would believe me since I am very well liked but some of them may never see me the same way again   Thank you so much for your perspective  3 Tragedy and comedy are one in the same thing  This Thread for me gives the sense of company even when you are alone if you look at the comments to most posts you'll see we try to cheer each other up at least as much as we can  i dont know the entirety of your relationship but what you described sounds pretty emotionally abusive and narcissistic behavior Have you considered not being a shitbag  but being worth someone else's time  The worst thing you can do is never tell her  I made that mistake  I had the perfect chance to ask her out  she dressed all cute on the last day of school  and had been flirting with me all year long  I really liked her but I didn't ask her out  I regret it all the time    Ask her out dude  If you guys talk a lot and she flirts with you  or you just know each other really well  she will probably say yes  The worst thing you could do is not ask her out like I did   I am close to your age and in a similar situation   It seems like this is the worst age to have no friends at because most people in our age group have full social lives  between families and friends from their youth   When I try to meet new people it seems like they are only interested in me for sex or money   I've been in therapy for years and I don't think it's helped at all   it's nice to have a chance to talk to someone and relieve the feelings of loneliness and isolation  but therapists aren't friends  if you stop paying them they stop caring   I guess I don't really have any advice but just know that you're not alone   There are lots and lots of us socially isolated people  I think most of them start committing suicide once they hit their fifties and realize it's only going to get worse  Yeah dude you got this  You got your priorities straight  Making sure you're on good terms with your friends and family over drinking   I agree with the others that you should trust your therapist in order to find the therapy useful  It seems you'd have to change your therapist  or then just acknowledge that the therapist is there for YOU  and to help YOU  and nothing else   I know I had the same problem with my therapist when I started to seek help for my depression  but it got better once I really worked with my emotions and learned to trust her  It was hard af to trust some random person youve just met  but if you manage to talk about everything with him her  it's gonna help you a lot   My best wishes for your process  stay strong     I have every intention to stay in academia  so I see nothing but school in my future  My country also doesn't have community colleges  just research intensive universities  All graduate degrees here require the corresponding undergraduate degree for entrance  My son got a 28 and is so happy  Congrats to you and a perfect score you should be so proud of yourself  your cousin also deserves to know her fianc is a prick   tell everyone   make him the one who doesn't wanna go to family events   he  should  be embarrassed  not you    You said you love the MMA training   is time a factor because you can't fit it in with work  If so it must be possible to pursue it as a weekend thing   All I know is that if you really love it you should find a way to make room for it  Life is too short to put what could be your true calling on hold  How do I tell people   Even when I'm lucid and  actually  rational it scares me to say it   I feel like something bad will happen if I tell people about the worst parts  like they'll hurt me or that they'll lock me up forever   Sometimes when I'm really energetic  manic maybe  I'll blurt out something I believe   Like that if I don't keep all the lights on in part of the house  something bad will be there   And after I tell them that  if they turn off the lights I think it's on purpose because they want me to be killed   I'm so scared to tell people in person  I'll probably even delete this whole account later  Damn  only saw this today  Hey man  I'm sorry you're feeling lonely first of all  That is a rough feeling and it can be hard to find relief  From your post  it sounds like you struggle with maintaining hope that you can start to feel better and become happy again  I have definitely felt like there was no way out  and no point in even trying  Your part about how being happy in the past makes you feel worse because you remember what it feels like absolutely resonates with me  For a while  it felt like my only reprieve came from reliving those good memories    You also talk about how you need support and have nowhere to turn  There's absolutely nothing wrong with that  Everyone wants support and someone to talk to  and you shouldn't feel ashamed for wanting that  Someone like a therapist or counselor can really help with initiating an emotional connection  and I can tell you from personal experience that they do help  It's a lot easier opening up to a therapist than a friend  in my experience  I was depressed only a couple years ago  for a few years  and I truly believe that with enough baby steps you can be happy again   If you're like I was when I was depressed however  you may be skeptical  Whenever I heard about someone who recovered from depression  I always thought they weren't  truly  depressed  or weren't as depressed as me  Or maybe their circumstances were different  or they were stronger than me  and so it was easier for them  Well  it is true that we have different circumstances  and so maybe you think there's still no hope for you  but hopefully I can show you that what you feel and think isn't always right    I'm talking about   cognitive distortions    which are when your brain tells you things that aren't true  Here's a page detailing a common few  http   psychcentral com lib 15 common cognitive distortions   You talk about how you can never be happy again  but why do you think that  You were happy 2 months ago  weren't you  You say that you fool yourself into thinking you're happy  but isn't that just an example of minimizing your accomplishments  Just because you feel depressed doesn't mean any happiness you feel isn't real  And just because you feel hopeless doesn't mean there is no hope for you  That's an example of   emotional reasoning     We believe that what we feel must be true automatically  If we feel stupid and boring  then we must be stupid and boring  You assume that your unhealthy emotions reflect he way things really are  I feel it  therefore it must be true   from the link above   Have you ever decided that someone won't like you before you meet them  Do you ever think that because you're not feeling happy now  you will never feel happy again  These are all examples of cognitive distortions  One good way I learned and am currently learning to deal with these negative  invasive thoughts is by using a website called https   moodgym anu edu au welcome  It's an online form of cognitive behavioral therapy which helps with learning to identify and deal with these negative and frankly incorrect thoughts  It isn't a replacement for therapy  but can be a good way to get you more started on the road to recovery   As for other things to help you get healthy  the key is taking baby steps  I keep a journal where I write one small victory every day  It could be going on a run  or even being extra nice to myself  You could try  for just 5 minutes a day  to treat yourself as you would a good friend going through a rough time  and then write down whenever you were nice to yourself  And when you say that you want to curl up and cry  then cry  Letting yourself feel those emotions and not trying to bottle them in is a great example of being kind to yourself   I want to remind you to reach out to a professional  and to remember that just because you feel yourself losing hope  does not mean health is out of your reach at all  Remember to take your thoughts and feelings with a grain of salt  since they're often just wrong and do more harm than good    Much love and if you want to talk or have any questions  shoot me a PM  I'd be more than happy to talk    Alex   Sounds like y'all need some couples therapy  Those who have success have built confidence  Thanks  I try to recognize the fact that everyone is in the same boat as well   I can be incredibly vindictive but joining groups on meetup and hearing people out helps me understand different perspectives   I'm trying to gain that bit of empathy that I seem to have lost along the way    I'll do everything I can to love myself as a whole     There was a post somewhere around here about YearCompass   I printed out their booklet and I'm going through it at the moment reflecting on my past year and what I have to look forward to   It's really helped me in realizing what I've gone through and how I've changed   It's been helpful in analyzing myself without judgement  Well we aren't supposed to make diagnoses but you should make an appointment with a trained professional   As you said yourself you believe you're "mighty" and smarter than everyone due to being bullied which is a sign of a certain mental illness   Being bullied wouldn't make you smarter   Studying will  Your joy from death and other people's pain  along with your violent mind set all are signs of the same illness  I would get it checked out before it gets out of control because it can be managed   Getting paranoid over an obscure chemical compound that you haven't even been in contact with doesn't sound healthy  If I were you  I'd set up an appointment with a psychiatrist or doctor   When your teeth start to look yellow or are showing stains  and you are no longer happy with what was once your beautiful smile  it is time to find a cosmetic dentist in Gresham   Seems like I'm in the same boat as you as in regards to the class levels and the stress  I'm not sure if it'll help much  but I shmooped and sparknoted the shit out of the book I procrastinated on  Pardon my language lol   If you know you can't finish the book  do as much research as you can on the plot line and then think of some topics that could be on the debate  Remember to answer the opposition  and stay as general as you can if you can't do that  Stay calm  You're going to be fine OP  I'm guessing there's some underlying stress you have that's been on your mind for a while that's getting you down  If you want to talk about anything  you can pm me  Good luck on your debate c   P s  I almost forgot about the audiobooks on YouTube  but there's that too  I hope I'm not too late  Woohoo motivation  Thank you so much  This actually really helped           I hope you're right about the large potential I have  my mental age and self improving at a young age is a sign of good things to come  It doesn't seem right  Shouldn't people my age who don't have to improve have more potential  They already mastered what I'm working on improving  so that must mean they are working in even more things    And next you're going to say showers don't exist either  "You play baseball like a girl" I understand  I think I was exaggerating a bit with my original post though  I'm not that paranoid I just wanted to know what others might have to say  Yeah  I hate shopping as well because it reminds me of what I look like vs what other people can wear and look great in  You may be misconstruing what confidence is  Let there be two people   1  Guy 1  who isn't confident to ask out girls and never does  2  Guy 2  who isn't confident  but acts like he's confident and asks a girl out  the act of asking a girl out shows confidence   Guy 2 will always perform better than Guy 1  all else being equal  It might be easier to say out loud any thoughts coming to your head with closer ppl  Try to fight the thinking "this is too stupid to say out loud" if thats the matter  In no time you'll propably come up with things to add to conversations   And hey  you dont even know them well  so just dont give a f what they might think of what you say  Its not that serious business  if its not work related  D   Psst    Your " "s make the list items a top level title  largest

   If that doesn't do it  then consider some analogies     You watch a 10 year old video of wartime brutality between two other countries  neither of which is yours    Should you feel guilty for this     You watch a video of people being hurt in a natural disaster   Should you feel guilty for this     My answer is no to both   You weren't involved in the war  and you didn't cause the natural disaster   Therefore you have no reason to apologize for watching the videos    As someone who almost quit high school when I was younger and really put no effort into my final years of high school   Don't quit  I regret it so much  Especially if it's going to effect the career you want   Try and find some other help  Maybe like a therapist kind of help  I was the same as you but I'm now 25 and if

with an instructor     If you can't do that  then just go out driving on your own and practice   Keep a 2 second gap between you and the car ahead  and always look before changing direction     I suspect practice on your own without constant rage from the parents will be a lot more useful    Good luck man  If your successful in convincing her I'd love to know too lol  A suggestion  this is more of an 'Ask Google' question than an 'ask  r needadvice' question   A quick Google search would easily turn up screenshots for Black Ops 3 PC graphics  after which you could judge for yourself whether the graphics are good     Otherwise you would be better in  r gaming or  r pcmasterrace      r needadvice is for life advice  and the people here are generally not the most useful ones to answer this sort of question  It likewise helps in enhancing the sexual soundness of your own  They beat the fights you require amid sexual brokenness  for example  erectile brokenness confront flabby

else in and have him know about it  sorta like how he doesn't know about this right here  I would assume there are signs that would be able to determine this sort of thing and maybe other people can help you figure it out  You remember when they said get a job doing what you love and you'll never work a day of your life  Total lie  It's still work and you'll end up hating the job eventually  plus now you'd be out of a hobby too   The real answer is to find something you're good at  and give it everything you have  With your degree   I'm assuming you stopped at the bs level  you aren't done with school  That degree is next to worthless without a master's of some kind  Maybe consider law  It's actually a great degree to pair with a JD  You can become the jury panel expert  They get paid bank plus one    For me  i finished my English degree and had no real prospects  Spent a year doing labor jobs and then decided i didn't want to be 50 with s blown out back and no savings  Thought back on my skill set and realized i was really did at magic the gathering  which is a highly detailed  rules based game  Decided to go to law school to get a JD and tax LL M  so far so good and I'm much happier feeling useful than i was simply getting by    P s  i have also dealt with depression and was diagnosed as bipolar  I was on most of the major meds  welbutrin  Prozac  lithium  etc  The meds made everything worse  They wouldn't m make me happy  just numb  which i found worse than the depression  Mix in the horrific side effects some have  and i noped the fuck out of treatment soon as i moved away for college  they started me on meds in 2nd grade   What ultimately got me head under my control was a mixture of meditation  regular exercise nothing gets those endorphins flowing like a dead lift   regular sleep  a healthy sexual relationship  and a balanced diet  using myfitnesspal   Mine joke about how my brother will be the reason they have grandchildren  They laugh about it  I do to  But I'm my head I'm wanting to kill myself   You okay  I mean  I can relate to how you feel  but no capitals  Wow  you must be sad  It's okay  I'll try to help  A couple years back I said this to a  now ex  friend who was depressed  Since then I've seen things from his perspective and I feel like shit for not understanding his POV and acting like I did   I recommend r wholesomememes The point of this post is that you can't "act confident" when all you've ever known is loneliness and rejection  It's not a choice  If guy 2 is able to 'act confident' its because deep down he knows he has a shot  no matter how slim  otherwise he wouldn't even bother asking the girl out  Guy 1 is unconfidemt and doesn't ask the girl out because he has no "confidence" that asking the girl out is worth the emberassment of rejection  Now  that lack of confidence may be all in his head but  either way  in his mind it's not  In guy 1's mind  through years of experiences that has shaped his mentality  this barrier is very real  There's a deeply rooted psychological barrier there that he's not able to just cast aside and ask the girl out   I am more of a single malt scotch hipster  Although  given the price  I may try the JB one of these days   Something people haven't mentioned that might help you personally is find a helping project that gives back  Especially if you hire a CEO it would be a good idea because you'll have less stress and more time  Figure out something you care about that needs help and go help  You mentioned you didn't come from much  maybe help underprivileged  you could create a way for them to learn more about technology so they have a skill to offer  Or you could help foster children  education  people with a particular sickness  Anything you have a connection to and see a need for aid  be the aid  It doesn't have to be big and fancy like a company  Just you giving back society  It's a very good way to raise your mental state  Do it on the side  Don't make it your main source of income unless someone straight up signs you in the next 2 years   Well  people should be honest and stop using "like you" and instead use "similar to you but with better  insert dating criteria "  In my experience  it's a skill just like anything else  As such  it takes constant practice  What's helped me personally is talking to myself in front of a mirror and trying my best to be articulate about an idea  Maybe about what I'm going to do for the rest of the day  my opinion on a topic  etc  I keep particular focus on what I want to improve each time I do this  Sometimes I focus on making my sentences flow together  other times I try to improve my enunciation  I was inarticulate in the beginning  and still am in certain topics  but I have improved to the point where I find speaking far easier in every day life  in arguments or casual conversation    Hopefully this helps you   Hey  writing is a huge passion for me as well   I was just in the middle of recommending Stephen King's "On Writing" when I decided to read your other post and realized you were way ahead of me    It seems you are really concerned in being the best and that determination to be the best can be used to fuel your success   At 15 you have an incredible potential to improve   Your brain is still developing and forming new connections  your perception of the world has only begun to form   Personally  those high school years were rough   I was always incredibly hard on myself for everything that I did   Even if there was an objective scale that declared my work as the greatest in all of time and space  I would still deny it and continue reaching for more  I did some quick looking around and found this  I think it will best explain what I think will help you  http   soulanatomy org the psychological reason creative people are their own worst critics   Be kind to yourself and don't be afraid to expose your work to the world   You will improve with time  there is no sense in condemning yourself to obscurity so early in the process  It's most likely dead   But if you're handy with tools it may be fixable     Most small motorized appliances have a thermal fuse that prevents the device from overheating too badly   If it was designed to work on eggs and you used it on thick batter  the motor probably overheated and blew the thermal fuse   Sometimes that fuse self resets  but usually not     If you open it up  unplug it first  somewhere near the motor will be the thermal fuse  which usually looks something like this  http   freek heaters com pics products cap10 4 g gif    It may be wrapped to the motor with zip ties and or Kapton tape  the clear ish orange y tape      If you take out the fuse  you can read what's on the side of it and get a replacement fuse  which will likely have to be crimped or soldered into the wire in place of the old one    You'll also want some Kapton tape to re attach it as it was   DO NOT DO NOT use normal tape  normal tape melts easily and can catch fire  Kapton tape does not     Otherwise just throw the appliance away and get a new one     Do some people  insert any behavior that is physically possible to be exhibited by humans      Yes  Be strong friend  Reach out even if it's just to one person  Having someone to lighten the load will do wonders   Thank you so much for sharing  You've given me a lot of stuff to think about  I had a rough time in college  so I've been hesitant about doing more school  I think it might be time to rethink that   If you don't mind me asking  how is your depression nowadays  I'm off meds and I'm managing my depression similarly  exercise  diets  some supplements  and socializing   It's a LOT better than my worst bouts  but I still feel pretty disinterested and unmotivated  I hope this isn't the best I can do  Your post gives me a lot of hope  so thanks again for that  Pretend your talking to them over the phone or even in real life  Ask her about her day and stuff  Be genuinely interested in what she has to say and constantly participate in the conversation  Girls love being heard and love it when they know guys are actually listening and care about what they have to say   Hi mate  Sorry to hear about your situation  Have you ever tried the app website "MeetUp"  or something similar  I've heard good things about them  It's basically set up for some local people with similar interests to get together and do things that they enjoy   Also  I second the therapy option  as a way to help you get a footing in your situation  It's not embarrassing to go  so maybe you could give it a shot  Lastly   actively  seek out opportunities where there will be people congregating and room for interaction  Whether this be a show  a concert  a tour  a baking class  or whatever it is  just do it  Who knows  maybe you'll find another hobby that gives you a little boost of fulfillment in your life  These situations are best set up for interacting with people  I have problems getting beyond the acquaintance level sometimes as well  and a lot of it is because I put up barriers and walls between myself and other people  I also subconsciously tell myself that people aren't interested in me or what I have to say  It helps to do confidence boosting activities  hobbies  exercising  eating well  etc    A handful of mindfulness in social situations also greatly helps  and sometimes you quite literally need to put yourself out there and outside your comfort zone  Be bold  Be unbashful  Don't stress too much about what others think  and most of all  just be more unequivocally you  Just be yourself in social situations  Open up to people and ask people to open up to you  if they feel comfortable after a but of time of course   Keep with it man  Seriously  it's never too late  Don't lose hope  Just do the things you love  try to find groups that do similar things  and you're already off to a good start  Also  try relocating to a new or more busy place with a diversity of people  You're bound to find someone who you can appreciate your time  The first step was asking for help  So good luck man  Hi there  Unfortunately this post has been removed  links to personal sites   gofundme pages are not allowed in  r needadvice   Please feel free to re post this without any gofundme or other personal links if you have an actual question   Thanks  I keep myself to busy to notice depression usually  It's actually a little worse tonight than usual because I'm home visiting family and i have too much time to think and remember and what if  But that's OK  sometimes a little sad is important to keep perspective    Just set goals and work to them  Ambitious goals that are realistically obtainable by you  Have a 10 year goal  a 5 year goal  a two year goal  and many short term goals  Use a calendar  If you don't write it down  it isn't happening   On the opposite side I'd tell OP to be careful with your advice as that may push him into the friendzone region  Yeah  this post seems to be aimed at people jumping from one relationship to the other to avoid adressing personal flaws or something   I look at that and I can't help but call it thrash  they clearly don't know what being FA  friendless FA even more  does to the mind of someone over the years  Sense of self worth  What's that    I see all of the successful guys out there and for whatever reason people always want to go back to them  For friendship or something further  I'm never that person for anyone and I wish I could be   in theory yes but its unlikely that most of these people will ever truly challenge themselves the way that you are already doing right now   Do you think your friends are on reddit right now trying to improve themselves   its more likely they are comfortable with what they have and the ego can be a very dangerous thing in that regard   Being confident and socially sharp takes consistent effort and its not something you can just master  coming from a place where you know both sides of the spectrum will only drive you to first achieve what you want  but to know the importance of maintaining your skill set   People become complacent with what they have and if they are not forced to better themselves  they tend to go backwards over time   the best example i can relate would be my own experience   Through school i was often feeling very alienated  never got dates like my friends ect  It really got me down but it only made me work harder to achieve what i wanted and to be accepted  I was always very curious and analysed my surroundings constantly  Fast forward to now   23 male  i have everything i want and if theres something i don't have i know the steps to achieve it  I have many solid friends  and hundreds of 'surface' friends and am often 'missed' if I'm not there  I am able to approach desirable in demand women almost effortlessly and they pursue me   Now when i run into these people who bullied or unintentionally put themselves above me i have no angst towards them  i actually feel sorry for some of them because of how little they have actually grown since high school and i can see how unhappy they are  Trust me  the 'cool guys'  'jocks' or whatever they are to you don't last forever because they're relationships while they may support each other now  are very superficial indeed   School is a hard time  because we all grow physically at different rates and theres so many social barriers going on   A lot of what I'm saying more so relates to the real world  but if you can start applying it now you will be so much better off in the long run   I was quite self conscious and thought people saw me as ugly or boring or whatever  but once i accepted my own identity and started defining my own style  life got so much easier  School doesn't give you very much freedom because your forced to do the same things everyday  This is very un natural to some people like yourself  but it was these thoughts  memories and experiences that were amplified and directed once i got out of school    with that said  if you really set your mind to it  you could be the school captain or the most popular person in school if you truly believed it and put conscious effort into it everyday  I thought it was impossible  but then i didn't start reading reddit and truly seeking knowledge and growth until long after my schooling days  so you're already ahead of me there mate    find your hobbies  passion  don't be afraid to be vulnerable  never stop learning and people will be drawn to your enthusiasm for life   I hope that helps   You can't trick your brain into being successful at something  nor can you create fake successes  It only comes from previous successful experiences  Part of making this actually happen is to actually have success   Great insight  I totally agree with you about this  I think a big part of why so many of us are stuck here is that we are repeatedly faced with challenges that are too far beyond our current capabilities    We are attracted to people that look healthy and have good genes  Those are the ones that are defined as good looking today  It's not fair  but that's nature and people can't help who they are attracted to   As someone who is less desirable than average  I have found that my compassion for others in my situation has increased  I have learned to focus my attention more on other people of a similar level of attractiveness to myself  I also don't just mean physical attraction   While we may be predisposed to selecting "good looking" genes  unattractive people wouldn't exist if these were the only genes that were passed on  There is also huge variation in what is considered attractive throughout the world    Status and Power is secondary to Looks   I have to disagree with you on this  Human behaviour is primarily organised around survival  and social status is a far more relevant predictor of ability to provide safety and comfort than good cheekbones  Unattractive people have the potential to succeed sexually if they have high social status or are willing to leverage the power they hold over others  This doesn't necessarily mean they are the most sexually attractive people  just that they are more desirable in a particular social context   That being said  I would agree with you if your point was that in our society  good looks can help people to attain higher social status    If you're a guy and you're good looking  women will intentionally make it easy for you to get with them if they want to be with you  That's easy mode   We seem to have this same debate every day  but there have been  many  examples here of good looking men who are forever alone  Men with shitty body language  hygiene  social skills  tonality  self awareness  etc can still ultimately be a "no" even if they happen to clean up well for photographs  While looks may be important  they are far from the only factor   As a side note  I don't like it when people here presume that women will always act a certain way in the presence of a good looking man  The notion presumes that women are shallow and lack autonomy  which is deeply sexist    There is no magic words or "pickup lines" that will instantly make a women interested in you  PUA is a load of bullshit  and I feel pretty bad for those that believe in it   I completely agree that PUA isn't magic  but who is actually saying that pickup lines work  There are thousands of PUA coaches out there  and they don't all necessarily use the same approach  Obviously spouting some canned line from the internet won't help  but what about having someone by your side to encourage you or teach you how to navigate new social environments  Maybe certain concepts from sales or public speaking could help you to develop some charisma  Perhaps an outside  unbiased evaluation of your general demeanour would help you to gain self awareness   Of course there are a lot of frauds and douche bags in the industry  but that doesn't mean that the concept of a "dating coach" is inherently flawed    Cold approaches just don't work   Pretty much  for the vast majority of people    The only way that you're likely to find a SO nowadays is through other friends   I wouldn't say it's the only way  but it is a very common way  Similar could be said for jobs and housing  Who you know is very important in many areas    Confidence doesn't exist   I think what you might be trying to say is that people commonly misunderstand the cause of confidence  I would agree with this  if this is the case  https   www reddit com r needadvice about rules   And you will be banned on your next offense or any rule  Just no  I wonder what is the most common cause of pain which this is prescribed for  Very true  We all know the legends of our brothers still stuck in the friend zone and it isn't pretty   Comp Sci college student here  Cheer up buddy  you've come this far    The best advice all I can say is   You've studied software engineering  I guess that you picked that major because you were also into it   and not a BA or else    You're probably more skilled with that rather than management   Better hire someone qualified for that position  someone who'd be able to create proper human resource department for your company ect    Or learn how to do it yourself  There are infinite resources on the internet or just look up scholarly books   Found this in a brief google search https   personalmba com best business books       Microsoft's current CEO is Satya Nadella and not Bill gates  if that helps anything  It sounds to me like you're self sabotaging  or just under too much stress  Take your time to be vegetative or binge watch netflix  there is absolutly nothing wrong with that   Or  invest in some charity work  Wish I had some better advice for you but I don't  so please have some internet hugs and good luck on your path internet stranger         I've removed your comment  and you were already tagged to remove on next rule break   I'm going to have to remove you from our sub  Sorry to hear you're in this situation  OP   As I'm not from the UK myself  US here  I don't know what government services would be available to you     I think you'll have healthcare though  so at least that's covered   Beyond that  I would suggest buying a rice cooker and cast iron pan and learning how to use them well   Rice in particular is a good way to eat easily and affordably   Then head to a library and start reading up on personal finance    "she doesn't make food or clean the dishes"   go to job centers and apply online  once you get the first job  start working immediately  quit when you get a better one  do not sit around waiting for the perfect job to show up  I have 4 degrees  and hate my job    do not pick up smoking or regular drinking or drugs  you will burn through the money in 3 months     Run for 30 mins every day and read everyday   u have any other family  why were you kicked out  Honesty is the best policy  If you're not romantically interested then you're not  you don't need to feel bad  Helps me  at least  Thanks for the suggestion  Shit still stings  Nothing can fill that void  Not fucking nicotine  not caffeine  not a girlfriend  nothing i have tried  Fuck  This  Fucking  Noise  Can you explain how being unemployed is "equivalent" to minimum wage  I'm actually curious  At least they're making money while you or someone else is probably sitting at home  doing probably nothing productive  Be fucking glad at least your brother has children  much better than nothing at all This usually takes a while to discover   He doesn't  But he will   This  People tend to think introverts are basically hermits and don't like people social settings  while some introverts are like actually like this  most are not   It's just an energy thing  I have friends who feed off of and thrive on social interactions  It keeps them going  Me  While I love being in the company of others and meeting new people  It takes A LOT of energy for me to have an extended social interaction  I feel renergized after some time to myself  For me  I try to extend my social endurance by having an equal level of enthusiasm throughout the experience  It helps a bit  but ultimately it's just who you are  Just make a concerted effort in these situations to participate  or find an escape route  Good luck  This is some solid advice  I really appreciate it    Thank you for taking the time to answer  I hope the holidays were good for you  I figured as much  It's a shame because prior to this event my attendance was exceptional and I worked very hard  Whatever chemical imbalance took place when he switched over my medications was really my downfall  I am not the type of person to just miss work like that  even during the worse time in my addiction     For the three weeks prior I had attempted to meet with the general manager to tell her I was concerned about my increasing depression  but both times she told me she could not make the meeting the day of  Another day I was told the owner was going to meet with me as some sort of punishment  however I was happy because I would finally get to speak to someone about the medical issues  After waiting around all day he just never showed up  completely wasting about 2 hours of my time  I did try to speak to someone on multiple occasions  I got the feeling that they didn't really care and just blew me off every time      On the bright side I can start a new chapter in my life Now that I have survived the holidays  I have to blow the dust of my resume and stay far away from the fast food industry   All that matters is that your heart stays young  There is nothing you can do about your looks and getting older  Keep that silly  outgoing heart you had since you were a child  It shrinks as you grow older metaphorically speaking   You're welcome    Have you considered trying to role play this in a way  You could set it up where she tells you she's going out for a girl's night at a local bar  gets dolled up and heads out  10 minutes later you also head out to meet her  but you act like a different person  use a different name and you her pretend you are strangers  Then you take her home they night and go hog wild as this "other man" having sex with your girlfriend   You could even have her describe to you the next day how awesome the sex was with the "other man " etc  if that's part of the fantasy for you   Worth a shot if you're interested in exploring it   "I hope you outlive your relatives" "You're face makes blind kids cry " Thanks   Your job isn't to be your kids friend  You're a parent and your job is to raise your kid to be a decent human being  Your wife was doing her job as a parent    The three days were not consecutive  A few times I had made meeting plans to tell them I was very concerned for my mental health and well being and they cancelled every time  They eventually ended up saying the owner was going to meet with me as some form of punishment  I was happy because I would finally be able to tell someone and get removed from the schedule  The day they said he would be coming in to speak to me I waited    He just never showed up  not even bothering to send me a text saying he couldn't make it      Not showing up I would expect to get fired  However if I tell management I need to talk to them about why I am having difficulties I expect them to at least take the time to sit and hear me out   They continued to keep booking me overtime and difficult hours   2016 was pretty bad  but hey here's this little peanut of wisdom  https   www youtube com watch v 7VbYokM9dY4 t   Hello  world                                           Two words  relativity absurdity                        Two better words  latency agony    Love   main c That's social anxiety  You worry so much about how other people will react to things you say that it holds you back from saying anything  Just try building up in smaller groups and getting more used to talking To me  it isn't that I don't feel like I have lasting impact on anyone  I do  I feel like the people I'm around right now will remember me for at least a little while if I was to leave their life right now   The reason I feel forever alone is that  besides relatives  I haven't had a person in my life be a common thread among all changes  I understand where you're coming from  I'm very openminded as to whom I would date for the most part  looks  interests etc   But I have to admit that if I felt we were really far apart on other levels and couldn't connect  that would probably not work out and I wouldn't pursue it    At the same time I feel a bit bad over it  I sometimes get the feeling that people who don't know me well might think I'm "special" in one way or another  Maybe cause of my looks or because I'm more on the quiet awkward side at times  The feeling usually goes away after they get to know me a bit and presumably see I'm fairly intelligent and normal but still  it would suck if some rejections has been a result of people thinking I'm special   That was unexpected but nice Before trying to get through to your brother first you need to get through to your mom  She seems like she still supports him and defends him and that might have to do alot with you  Your clearly succeeding a lot more than him in life already and that usually scares a lot of mother's especially single ones  They worry that once all the kids grow up and leave that they literally have nothing else to do  She might just be holding on to the moments she still has with him while she can because she's already had to accept that your moving on  If you can get through to her that he needs help and needs a jumpstart in life then maybe you can both sit him down and try to talk to him about his future  Tell him to cut the crap and confront him on all his lies  I know you've been trying for six months already but don't let him just get by with a "whatever I just don't want to get a job or go to school" or whatever he'd say  Sounds like he's using your mom as a source for everything  food  home etc  which really isn't fair and if you can get your mom to say that to him then that should be a clear wake up call  Hope this helps and good luck   Dude you seem very intelligent and eloquent  if you enter a challenging field you will do just fine in the friends department  You can become a Teacher's assistant if they have that at your college   I know that you're looking into losing weight and that should help with the romantic part  You sound completely normal  I don't find that your standards are high at all  It does sound like you can't handle rejection well    Hey man  i'm also from Australia  i'm from melbourne  i was really interested in your post  and i'm realising now that i'm writing some kind of thesis  i don't blame if you can't be bothered to read it   also i dont spell very well       Writing that title made me sound like the most conceited person  but I'm not   i wouldn't say that  i read the title and actually got anxiety  that is alot of responsibility at an age when most are in college playing video games and partying in their spare time     This is everything I ever wanted  and it's also nothing that I wanted  I always wanted to run my own company with staff  big revenue  global offices  executives  board meetings  and all that  I always wanted to travel to offices around the world and manage my teams  but it's nothing like I dreamed    The money we're dealing with  exposure  is all a dream come true  but why isn't it what I imagined   Society often instills people with image of a successful person as someone who is rich  powerful etc  as if there is a standard factory model for success that fits all people  there is nothing intrinsically WRONG with money and power  but it's easy to confuse societies concept of success with 'life fulfillment'    Only YOU yourself can decide if you are successful  You might be monetarily successful  but what about relationships  happiness  things people often throw to the wayside in 'pursuit' of riches for their entire lives    The money we're dealing with  exposure  is all a dream come true  but why isn't it what I imagined  We have a global team of over 100 people  offices in 3 different countries  and all that shit  But  it's just so different  The problems seem to outweigh the 'perks'  For example  I bought my dream car  helped family pay off debt  started other businesses  financially free etc   that's all good and well  but is it worth it  It's always a question popping up in my mind   you said it isn't what you imagined  this is a good question man  what did you imagine  sometimes the 'dream' isn't something that is genuine or from you yourself  it's someone elses vision FOR you  something picked up from society  family whoever    my instinct tells me alot of your problems have less to do with money and more to do with your own beliefs and values  and possibly the values your parents have instilled in you  you say your parents have raised you to be 'kind and humble  and to help others' and yet you have a job that may constantly challenges these values  This sounds to me extremely stressful  and a source of intense internal conflict    Nobody wants to hear their CEO complaining  and nobody from my family friends understands  They just think I'm complaining for the sake of complaining   And It can be very isolating to never be able to talk to someone about these things  someone who will fully listen to you without judgement or bias  someone who can listen to you and not just think of you as the CEO  but an actual person  i really get what you're saying here     The biggest issue I feel    I was a very nice and humble person growing up  now  not so much  I am jaded  I am capitalistic  I am assertive and dominant  I go and get what I want  and sometimes I take it  It's as if everything in my life is trying to change me  and I don't want to change anymore  but I have to  The pressures on me are from 50 different directions  and I'm struggling    what is the 'everything' in your life that is trying to change you   yousaid near the start of your post that you 'have everything you ever wanted' and 'it's all a dream come true'   and yet you are typing like a prisoner  someone who has no control  I think this is a problem you should examine dude  honestly i feel nervous trying to give so much advice to you  but i would say that rather then telling you what to do with your business  of which i'm pretty sure you know better then me  i would instead start with looking inwards  a psychologist is a brilliant idea     goodluck man  How did she react  As long as you weren't creepy about it  I'm sure it would have been fine I have a Facebook that I use to follow my classes group and help people with homework I just like helping people but I don't use my real name and a picture of my dog   You are not alone  You are not the only one  Please  reach out  I've been where you were are too many times to count  It can get better  You are not alone   Synesthesia is a medical condition where cross wiring of the brain can cause one input to produce atypical outputs  such as emotion to vision or smell to sound  There is more info on this page  http   www daysyn com Types of Syn html  I have OCD as well as multiple types of synesthesia  The most similar experience I have to yours is seeing mental images in response to music  Awesome that you have taken a lot from the experience  Also your ex bf is an ass I have the same issue with my mom  I'm a sophomore  and I say to her "Do you want to see me at my wedding " and "Do you want to see my children " She gets close to tears when I do this though  She won't quit no matter what I do  Holy shit  congratulations  That's fucking amazing   I'm so sorry to hear about your news  Your family might think that you don't really remember him  They should still be supportive though  Big hugs for you   reply if you do and her response please  D You got it  I'm so sorry  Please PM if you need to talk  I've been there   Did you wake up earlier  but sleep for 69 hours  What   Anyways  yes  weird sleep patterns can cause your brain to do weird stuff  If you seriously did just sleep for 69 hours  you can get weird sensations like that   anecdotal  but I have severe sleep problems myself and I totally know that feeling you're talking about  Kind of like when you've been on a plane and it feels like you're still descending a few hours after you get off  I guess the same way your body gets itself used to descending  you get used to the sensation of lying down  and then the disconnect between that and reality causes you to feel like you're falling  Not sure though   Less anecdotal  I get this after sleeping for too long  but sleeping for 69 hours is not normal in the first place  I think you should ask your doctor what he thinks it might be  If your exams are seriously stressing you out  it could be that  There are also other things that can cause swings in the amount of sleep you need   anxiety  depression  probably other things  And 69 hours is a big leap from normal   As for the falling sensation  while it may be a normal reaction to sleep that long  you should still make sure that if when you get dizzy  that you get yourself in a safe position  Preferably lying down or sitting down leaning over the table  anything you can do to make sure that in case you actually pass out  you won't fall and hit your head  That's a big hazard you can do something to prevent   All in all  I have no doubt you're going to be fine  though  But I still think you should get a professional opinion  And especially if it happens again   Feel free to pm me whatever you find out  I'm actually pretty interested  o Remind her it's not just her life she's affecting  Do your research on second hand smoke and how it can affect you and the people around her  One day just sit down with her and talk about all this stuff  I'm assuming your still kinda young so ask if she plans on seeing you succeed in life because if she keeps smoking she most likely won't live long enough to see it and that's what every mother really wants  Ask if she wants to one day meet her grandchildren  long term stuff like that  It kinda sucks but you really do need to make her feel as bad as possible but at the same time support her to the max and let her know that if she quits you'll be right by her side for any emotional support  It won't be easy for her and down the road there'll be times where she'll really want to smoke but you just have to keep supporting her and remind her who she's really affecting both physically and emotionally  Hope this helped and good luck   I have a friend losing his hair at age 21 it sucks to go through  Hes friends  parents and other people talk about it behind his back  its really sad  The way I see death is pretty much just the nothingness we experience during sleep except forever   Then at the same time there was a nothingness before we were born  and I'm sure you can't recall many memories before the age of 2   Don't worry about what comes after death  we all find out eventually   So let's focus on living  I understand having a family that isn't very supportive   At that point you just have to accept it and focus on supporting yourself   A counselor therapist can really help you piece together what's on your mind   Everything is confidential and they are unbiased  it makes for excellent discussion   You say you work and I'm glad   Having a good work ethic will be key here   I'm not sure what you do or what your plans are but it wouldn't be a bad idea to find a second better job   Building your funds and moving out may be good for you   Friendship  is a tricky thing   It isn't very common that high school friends remain together after   If they haven't kept in touch it could be for any number of reasons   They can be incredibly busy in this new world they are finding themselves in   Also  if you haven't tried contact them yourself then you should give it a shot   No need to wait for things to happen   Don't count on siblings for friends  you are your own person and should make friends based on shared interests values rather than convenience   I highly recommend meetup com  it has been incredibly useful for me in finding new friends   I'm turning 25 soon and it is difficult making friends but it isn't impossible  The key is to expose yourself to new situations and let relationships bloom naturally     Another cliche is volunteering  you can meet a lot of people from different walks of life   Joining a gym could really help in this regard as well   I joined a gym beginning of last year and noticed that you'll see a lot of the same people   I joined classes and socialized with the people that I saw on a regular basis   Physical fitness is one of the greatest things you can do for yourself  the benefits will leak into all other aspects of your life   I know this got long but there's just one more thing   Don't worry about what defines happiness and how long it will last   "This too shall pass "   Everything comes and goes   Happiness  sadness  people  etc   It's part of the human experience   I strongly relate to you and know how hard things can be   With effort  you can make a life that is yours and yours alone   Take hold of opportunities  take risks  make mistakes  learn from them  Take a look at this http   yearcompass com  and objectively look at this past year and take a look at what you want to come next   I wish you the absolute best in your journey  be strong   Thanks for the advice bro  I'll try this  Not really friends now are they  I vote for be a drama queen   Nobody should get a pass for being such huge dicks   Especially with regard to legitimately dangerous firearms and mental illness   Nope   They're not trying to "educate" you  or "get you comfortable " they're being enormous dickheads  Just yesterday I put my kids behind the baby gates and went to hide under the duvet to cry for twenty minutes  Babies are hard  especially when they can start to make their displeasure known  I really empathise with a lot of your post and I can't imagine dealing with all of that on top of your medical issues  I'm so glad you have an amazing husband to support you  I really hope you make it to that next appointment  Remember  you grew  birthed and kept alive a whole human being for a whole year  That's an amazing achievement  now go tell that doctor that that process and all those damn hormones screwed with your brain chemistry   go the er  you might not think youre that bad off now  but its best to get checked out  especially if your necks hurting    its a screwed up feeling going thru something like that  when i was younger  and had only been driving about 3 years  i blew a tire on a hole that was on a dirt road  i lost control and started heading for a tree  but i cut the wheel and ended up flipping my car 3 times in a field  i was okay tho  i dunno how  but i just hit the rear view with my forehead and only ended up with a bruised knot  i went and got checked out anyway  bc ya never know if youre more messed up than you think you are  plus you may end up really hurting later  so meds might help    please go to the er   as a random stranger  im glad it wasnt any worse     Honestly I don't remember a lot of like defined memories with him  But I do remember little things like him buying me my first Furby as  a kid because I begged my mom and she said no  Or him and I running around the house screaming for no reason  But it's just hard  Thank you for your support Here's what I would do  Give him a chance  and if he says anything racist  dump him for being racist  If he doesn't say anything racist  then this was bad advice because you'll be stuck in a weird relationship with a guy you don't really like  But if he  does  give you a reason to dump him  you might help him get over his racism  It's a really mean way of doing him a favor  but ultimately I think you come out ahead   In the end  OP  I honestly don't think you're gonna like being in a relationship with this guy  You're right  everyone deserves to be with someone on their level  You know that you're intelligent  but you also don't feel that you're worth being with  Right now you say it's because you're overweight  but let me say something here  If you find the motivation to lose weight  you'll still make a reason to feel like you're not worth being with  The lack of self worth is your underlying issue  and being overweight is the excuse you use to cover it up  The truth is you do deserve someone who's worth your time  and it doesn't matter what you look like  It matters how you make others feel  The first step to making others feel good about being around you is making yourself feel good about being around you  Does that make sense  You gotta wine and dine yourself  treat yourself right  like a person worth pursuing  Pursue yourself until you feel good about who you are  and then you can honestly say you wouldn't feel bad about offering yourself to someone else  That self worth is inside you  you just gotta dig deep until you find it  I only have a job because I ended up in a really niche industry and it bounced back after 2008  I take it you're not in an Obamacare state  I have a relative who hasn't been able to work in years but her state offers a plan  I hope things turn around for you  Do you think the guy could be potentially dangerous or is he just a racist person  Yea I think the key is to make her feel as bad as possible but at the same time let her know that you're going to support her as much as possible  I'm sure she'd feel better and maybe more willing knowing she didn't have to do it alone and had you to go to  Depending on your personal dedication on seeing her quit  offer to accompany her to support groups and such   This was a psytrance goa rave  Same type of crowd with drum n bass and jungle  and techno  house not as much   Where do you live   You sound strong  Keep going  Tag Probably back pain  If your in high school  dont  Theres virtually nothing you can do without at least a high school degree that ive come across  even all the minimum wage jobs ive had have required a high school degree at the least  College degrees are becoming the standard unfortunately  but high school is the BARE MINIMUM  The only position you will be in after leaving high school is trying to find a job and once you do youll be stuck between trying to move out and dealing with the repetativeness that is your life  Just keep moving forward  itd be a shame for someone to drop out so early  Alot of the burnout factory workers I've met over the years peaked in high school  and if you leave early you wont even have the "Glory Days" to fall back on even if you dont continue your education after that  Your not going to win the lottery or become immensely succesful overnight  Take your time  work on what you need to and keep moving forward    2 time college dropout here  Still trying to get things on track myself  There is a 30  sub some regulars from here hang out there from what I remember  I don't want to downplay the role of personality in dating and stuff  it's definitely important  but I feel it's less important in actually securing a date  It's good for long term stability but in terms of building an initial impression  unless you're deeply anti social or abnormal  most people can get by on attracting people with their appearance  "game " social capital  and interests  I'm not really scoring in any of those areas  Not that I'm ugly  I'm probably average  maybe slightly below  but I don't have game and my social capital has plummeted since college   Friending girls is good for making friends  I had a lot of lady friends in school and some I still talk to now  but it never built my confidence in talking to women in a more romantic or sexual manner  and it's not supposed to    The arranged marriage thing was a joke  even though my dad is from a culture where that is a viable option lmao  My silent hope is that I can meet an FA love shy girl in real life  The thing is like I said though it's not like they wear special pendants or something lol  Simply going to a bar and hoping I get a girl who is inexperienced is a joke too   Yeah I acknowledge I'm pretty hard on myself  but it's pretty common among FAs  It's really hard not to  For most of my life  while I was never hated I just never seemed to fit in while most people have without question  At some point you can't help but feel defective  which can make you feel anything from sad to personally responsible and guilty   You are not alone  I have suffered the same feelings and I'm so happy that you're getting help  Good luck   Apples are like the fruit cousin of oranges  Try to make a goal for yourself each week in being more socially active  Talk to one person a day  Talk to one person online a day by sending a dm to someone or commenting on someone's post  Find meetups in your area  Sign up for a class  any class like yoga  self defense  art  whatever that you can go to each week and socialize with people there  You can use a bus  a taxi  Uber  or Lyft to get around  idk how many cents per mile in your area you can google that   You have to download the app on your phone so you can see who your ride is and their license plate  There are websites you can make some cash like Swagbucks and QuickRewards to go to your Paypal to make a little cash  Amazon is the best site to buy cheap phones to call and text friends and you can buy T mobile phone cards for  10 to  20 with free unlimited data  talk  and text  Also there are online therapists to talk to online about your social anxiety problem  There are some vitamins like Vitamin B3  B6  and St  Worts that can help decrease anxiety  They are available at Whole Foods  but you can probably get them on Amazon for cheaper  Even if you fail at an interaction going the way you want it to  keep reaching out and don't close yourself off no matter how you feel  If you have to take a break to yourself that's fine  but closing yourself off for long periods of time   the feeling will just get worse  Hope you get better     It sorta depends where you live  I'm am "that" guy who gets along with everyone and I do get invited to parties a lot  But remember that in university it isn't just the cool kids who throw parties  I've gone to Esports club parties where we watched the world Championships on paperview   they rented out a cinema   Any party is a good party  Maybe you are THAT guy but not quite embedded enough in their social groups that they WANT you to be there all the time WOW just WOW   It's really amazing to see just what people do for some money   You know  I actually was with your kind at some point in time  I was in dire need of help  Nowhere was stated that "Tough Love" would be the way to treat their patients  And I can only say that I now value you people less than other humans  For the most part  you're not even nice people to begin with   Are you also doing it because you need to let off some steam or something  If so  then there'd be plenty of other ways to vent  if you really have that need      BUT OH  I FORGOT      You don't "earn" any    money    that way  I get it now  Yeah     Wow  talk about disrespectful on her behalf  This is what sucks about high school if i remember correctly  the "adults" are always in the right  The teacher should essentially be like a co worker but a little more authoritative  however  having one go out of their way to share a personal essay with people whom it was not intended for is not only unprofessional but incredibly rude  I wouldnt advise confronting her because then it turns into he said she said  And guess what  then she wins because your just the high school kid that confronted a teacher  Go to the principle and discuss it  I hope it works out for you   Pain is his AstroTurf  I think what you did is perfectly normal  Most people  even ones inside relationships  like flattery and attention  A lot of people get touchy feely and huggy when drunk  I know I do   It feels good  and it's a platonic form of intimacy    Cheating should be defined between you and your boyfriend  What constitutes as cheating to one couple  is perfectly comfortable and acceptable to another couple  Every couple has different boundaries and definitions  I personally tend to be very intimate with my platonic friends  both male and female   I tend to hug them a lot  kiss them on the cheeks  and with the ones I'm even more comfortable with  I cuddle with them when we're watching tv together or something  One of my good girlfriends came over last night because she was sad  going through a breakup   and I laid with her on the couch for a long time  while she laid with her head on my chest until she stopped crying    I'm a big fan of innocent  platonic intimacy and affection  and I'm one of those people that just tends to crave and need that in my life  When I'm close to someone  I just naturally want to touch them and express my love for them physically  I get a lot of emotional fulfilment when I'm physically affectionate with my friends  My fiance knows that I do these things  and we are both comfortable with it  He knows he can trust me  and that my physical affection toward my friends stays platonic  and would never turn romantic or sexual   I think you and your boyfriend should have a frank and honest conversation about what your boundaries are  and what you're both comfortable with  And just remember that you don't have to be perfect   you're human  Sometimes human beings do need flattery and attention  I think that's just natural  It's really easy when you're still quite young and in one of your first serious relationships  to put unrealistic expectations on yourselves  Don't worry so much  and have that talk with your boyfriend  There are career advisors in the sense of "I've graduated  now what "  but nothing really for my situation  We do have the Taught Programmes Office but students never interact with the TPO  it's an internal admin thing  We are meant to go via our department  who are being entirely unhelpful   I want to say something helpful  I am the parent of a transgender child who has struggled with depression  anxiety  bpd    IT GETS BETTER  I know it doesn't feel like it will possibly will but  hang on  As to this  I have a strong urge make her cry and I hate myself for it  Why do I hate her  I don't understand why I feel this way  I don't want anyone to suffer  and yet I still feel like this     Its natural for you to feel like this  imo  consider that you might be mad angry that she should have could have been a better friend   You might be angry  but you are a caring person and really don't want them to hurt  the fact that you care is the wonderful part of you   Hang on   My child took classes at the next city over community education  clay  art  painting    Those people had no expectation of my child other than how they presented them self at the class  but  passing as the correct gender was always a worry  and it caused anxiety  but they kept working  pushing forward   two steps forward  one step back    I wish you the very best on your journey and there are many people who care  if you can reach out to a support group  i know it was hard for my child too   but there is support for youths dealing with more burdens that the society puts on them then they deserve   And speaking as a parent If we are supporting your transformation  and use the wrong pronoun it's not because we don't care  it has to do with old people brains  and rewiring the words that you have attached to your child for the majority of their lives is hard  I have been rambling  sorry I have ADHD  something else i passed to my child     TLDR the fact you don't want anyone to hurt shows your goodness  hang on it gets better   Tldr  My "annoying ex partner" doesn't need or want words of encouragement from me  She's plenty happy with her heaps of social success and tall boyfriend  Fuck  The first step on the road to recovery always seems the hardest  Please let the professionals help you  because believe me that is what they  want  to do   You are a good mum  and your husband is a good dad  My best wishes to you all    Thanks  man  The problem is  everything becomes a problem in my eyes when I feel that way  The next day it's over  the next week it comes back  I'm learning everyday to get away from it  to put things together and see through all of this   I think I'm on my way to see things getting better  but there's some bad days in the middle of it  Just gotta concentrate and stay strong   Same here  I'm not memorable  at least not in a positive way  The only way someone would remember me is if I inevitably did something weird and embarrassing  I find meditation helpful as well  Its unfortunate that it takes too long to meditate myself back to a better state of mind in order to be social again   You sound like someone who is extremely kind and non threatening  You could have been the only woman in the world who was able to make those guys feel safe enough to be able to share their feelings with you  Not only that  but you were independent and open minded enough to see things from their perspective and recognise their positive traits  I really don't believe you have anything to be ashamed of  People like you are actually quite rare  and    special in a meaningful way   I snooped on your post history and learned that you are only 17  I really don't want to trivialise your doubts and insecurities  but I feel you may have quite a while before you need to seriously worry about being forever alone  I know people here are all about how looks are everything  but I think that's a relatively extreme view  In my experience  women as kind hearted and independent as yourself tend to stand out to the right person  In high school  the right person is probably just too dorky and inexperienced to acknowledge it    Obviously the selfies and such i post online are just of my face in good angles and shit  In real life I'm overweight  I don't really have the talent nor effort for make up  I don't have cute girly clothes cuz they don't fit right on me  And I don't know what to do about it   So you have good angles  You're halfway there  It takes time to feel comfortable dressing for your body type  I know people well into their twenties who still don't know how to dress  and women in their thirties who can't makeup   Of course  I am not even going to pretend that I know how to advise you on how to dress  I do know that there are quite a lot of young women in your position  however    I'm not trying to be rude  I'm only being honest  I don't want children or anything    I'm sorry  but I had to laugh at this  No one is judging you for setting a chromosome restriction for your future boyfriend    I feel more alone than ever now  Listen  I know a lot of you out there may have never had anyone interested in you  Maybe I'm also presuming so much but anyway  Wouldn't you choose no one to want to date you rather than ONLY special people to want to date you  I'm sorry   I'm sorry you feel alone  I have actually had women interested in me  but I tend to have similar problems to you in that I attract people with mental problems  or those who are too insecure to approach anyone else  Part of being a nice person is learning to stand up for your own requirements  I've never regretted turning down someone who I knew I was fundamentally incompatible with  The other part is knowing when to make your move  and that is where I've always struggled   You seem like a very sweet and compassionate person  and I hope things will work out for you in the future    I dont have aspergers  but we seem to share a similar behavior  I force myself to be social but after a while it becomes a struggle Ouch  Fuck  even more depressing to know    We are providing new year special full body massage  thai massage and ayurvedic massage don by well trained north and south staff hygenic a c room  hot water  steam bath spcial packages also available in Delhi  Nah they are much worse Yeah there's something about a transitioning of moments that seems to flip the switch  Nothing specific to anyone or anything  but as one moment  no matter how big or small the moment  either  changes to the next  something triggers the change in our mental state    I've dont this to  but on a smaller scale  I used to rave a lot  and have gone with many different groups  I think I've voluntarily left my group halfway through the event when no one was looking more times then I've stuck with the group for the whole thing  Although  I would always eventually make my way back to the group after some time had passed  This happens at large parties as well   Please tell her and search for help  If she has suffered an eating disorder herself she certainly will not tell you ''I told you so''  Please tell her  you don't have to walk this road alone    I have multiple conditions resulting in excruciating pain and I haven't found a single painkiller that lasts as long as claimed   IMO the best one was called ketoprofin which was sold under the brand name Orudis  My prescription pills were 75mg  over the counter were 12 5 and it was absolutely the best   But not because it lasted the longest  it took effect the fastest  It was also non narcotic   Unfortunately  it also apparently caused heart problems     I haven't been able to get it in years   Tl dr   there are hipster pain killers  My favorite is really obscure  you probably haven't heard of it  Shitty reality am I right   Ask the same question here to different kinds answer r asktrp Yeah my ex boyfriend constantly cheated on me I found out  That's a good idea  thanks     I ended up in the ER for kidney stones    morphine is really nice  Best transition to daylight savings time ever  From what your step mothers tells you  it look like your disorder is quite apparent  "Look at you  your nothing"  You probably don't agree that you are too skinny  this is very common in anorexics  I think being open with your family will make you feel a lot better  and potentially help you with your disorder  You've already told reddit about it  and I think that a good first step  I hope that the feedback you get here will encourage you to tell someone you know  If not  why not talk to a therapist  Their the most qualified people to give you advice after all Thank you  and yes she's already here as a student  Thanks  yeah this situation is pretty similar to mine  I appreciate the input   Post history checks out  Yes but at least im a real human bean Yup  this is the kind of girl all guys want     I thought I could relate to this post  assuming you were having murderous thoughts about your SO while they snored  And here we are  I'm so sorry this is happening to you  that's a tough situation  I'm no expert on any of this by any means  but this would be my opinion  take it as you will    For one  your dad needs professional help  As hard as that may be  it's not just going to change right away  Him being watched by family is a good temporary solution  but won't last long  Honestly I don't even know what to recommend for him  but a professional will be the best solution   As for school  I don't recall you saying high school and since you mention scholarships i'm going to assume you're in college  Scholarships are something that if you decide to keep with school  can make a HUGE difference  even if it's just books for a semester  that money could be food on the plate for a week  or even rent for that month  Take every scholarship opportunity you get and talk to a councilor for any you can get as well   For a job  depending on what your schooling is like  plenty of places take college students  It may not be the most entertaining job  but again it will be food on the table per say  Maybe take night classes with a full time job  or if you don't need the money that much get a part time that will let you work after school or something  One thing that helped me through crappy jobs is knowing you won't be there the rest of your life  so get something that can help put some ground under you   I have a little experience with my dad having worked as a police officer for the past 30  years  our family is starting to notice how much that can really affect a person's mentality  So it's tough to see situations like this  and your family will be in my thoughts  It's late as i'm typing this  so i hope this is all accurate  One more thing is that your family will always be most important  obviously helping your dad get better is important  but making sure other family members  like your mom  are taken care of too  Wish you the best op  keep us posted    Seems i didn't read the first paragraph all too well  my bad  Something that works for me is taking time out to actually feel these bad feelings  instead of trying to supress them  You can do it as a meditation practice  where you just sit down to feel whatever comes up  Just remember to accept everything as a 'part of you'  and don't try to run from whatever pops up   I think that this will help keep things in check  as suppression is not really a healthy long term strategy imo  Good luck  Oh and exercise also helps    Yes  You'll turn into a radioactive spider  I don't go out at all  unless it is for work  A super important point is that often what you know you have to do is very hard to do  For example you might not want to have kids  but others pressure you so you feel you have to  The majority of people will make inauthentic decisions to avoid pain  which is worse than any bad outcome that could come from being authentic  i slept for 6 hour lol   im even typing shit now lol     but yeah evertime i tilt my head backward  i have the feeling my body is gonna  i'm having a hard time sitting down and standing up    I wouldn't think it weird since you're the same gender and just doing it to be friends  I would be honest and upfront  You don't even have to do it face to face   sometimes it's even better to just write a letter  Do it through email or private message on facebook  Writing a letter is my preferred method of conversation because you can get everything out that you want to say the WAY you want to say it  you don't forget anything or misspeak    I'd tell him that you feel betrayed and affronted because you know that he  knows  you are interested in this girl  and you saw them being physically intimate at the party  Tell him that's just not something you expected from him  and that's not what friends do to each other  Tell him that you wouldn't do that to him  I'm assuming that's true     Then ask him if he likes her  too  Tell him that if he does  you wish he'd have told you  Then  if you still want to be his friend  and wish to fix your friendship  let him know that  Tell him that you still care about him and your friendship  but that you need these questions answered  and that you'd like to work it out  I am introverted  but I do want friends  only problem is people are repulsed at the sight of me  They mostly mock me about my appearance and lack of friends significant other  I would happy to have you as a friend  Hey  I'm sorry your mum did that to you  At least it was a fairly ordinary conversation  here I was thinking it would go much worse   There will be a light at the end of the tunnel for you  I promise  You have a lot of issues caused by your sexual abuse  have you seen a professional about it  Part of learning how to deal with things like this is to get professional help  You can't sort it alone and nobody in your life that hasn't been trained to help sort it an either That's amazing  I'm proud of you   Can you make the communism connection more explicit  I don't think it's as obvious as you think it is    And just so you know  there are people who licensed psychiatrists have diagnosed with autism and other neurovariations who hang out on this sub  Stumbling onto neurodiversity does not automatically result in hurt feelings  changes in political affiliation  bad decisions  or rejecting the medical establishment   Not saying any of those things are impossible  but the first line of your post presents this as inevitable     Also FYI  Your post has been reported 4 times and marked as spam    We generally avoid silencing people with different political viewpoints  because shutting down dissent is bad for discussion and bad for democracy  However  tread carefully   I'm so sorry  I hope you're feeling better now  How are your dad and your sister   Sounds amazing  I'm so happy for you Kottonmouth Kings have an official Facebook page  an official Twitter   kottonmouth   an an  official website  http   www kottonmouthkings com    I would start by sending messages through one or all of those  This is the easiest way to get a message to them  since their publicist like set these pages up  It may take a while for them to check into them though   They are managed by United Family Music  who also have an FB page and a twitter   officialunitedfamilymusic   If you don't get a response from the band's socials then try this one  they're probably more active   Their booking agent is Alex Gilbert  alex arteryglobal com   This is an utter hail mary  Obviously he has the means to contact the band  since he's the guy they use to set up shows  But whether or not he'd be willing to pass along your message is what I don't know  Unfortunately there is not a lot of reseach going on  In the past years there was a study in Switzerland by Gasser  in Great Britain by Robin Carhart Harris and David Nut and now these new studies in the states  Apart from that there is not much official research   However there are older studies from the 1950ies and 60ies which indicate benefits for depressions and there are plenty of people  including myself  who have been able to improved their mental state using psychedelics   When using psychedlics be careful about the dose  set and setting and so on  Read all you can on the topic so you have a idea what you are up to  I'm afraid I don't have any practical advice about your current problems  What I do know from personal experience is that you will leave the fuck ups behind you as long as you keep going  I'm so sorry that you're having such a bad start to the year and I hope you can get some help with this  Go to the hospital  If you are at a point you have to call a suicide hotline because not being able to care for your sick child without feeling like a complete failure  how is doing it again the next day going to make it better   Either that or have your husband take time off work to be with the baby while you go to a family or friends to recuperate while calling the hotline  If you are off your meds get back on   Don't repeat the same cycle and expect things to get better  because it won't   I'm so sorry for your loss  as I like to share how it was growing up as a child with no parents  I lost them at age 5 6  I remind people to cherish the memories they have of their parents  Because I don't have any of mine  Do what you need to grieve  but remember to pick yourself up   I like the flair guy   lol   I don't know if you are seeking advice but    when I begin to tire of a social situation  I usually try to encourage everyone into an activity such as cards  going for a walk  or going shopping  A new activity usually energizes everyone including myself  If you are doing anything for a prolonged period of time    well of course you are going to get bored  However I don't know why you become very apathetic and dissociative so suddenly   I am sorry   If you give up  you'll never see what you can become  You'll never see the wonders that our human lives can deliver   My main motivation in life is to earn a lot of money   You'll want to change that  Studies have found that students whose primary motivation is to earn a lot of money are the most likely to fail and or drop out  and it is negatively correlated with GPA   Could you just say  "Hey  I'm too busy to take that course this semester  but I'll do my best to see about getting signed up next semester "  If he asks why you're too busy just say you've got some complicated family matters going on at the minute that you aren't free to discuss  So you saw your friend putting his head on the chopping block  So sad    marriage is about announcing your economic contract of union to the community  so some make the proposal public too  It's a dangerous path when we start making excuses for other people's behavior  You seem to have ignored some red flags  and that's fine  what's done is done   But try to take those into account and see her for who she really is  Everything you dreamed of  Did you dream to be with someone who would lie to you by omission  Is the girl of your dreams dating someone else in 5 days  really  Dream higher  Keep things real and good luck   It's a bit like finding a job in this economy and overpopulation    Warning  Horrible spam on mobile  Going back to schools ALWAYS a great idea   If not school then just classes  Take a class in improv   those are a ton of fun and you make great friends and become more social and it's like playing games when you are a kid   Either that or join some other club class   Also  if you're not already on Zoloft or something you may want to start  That shit can help and it helped me    Also  exercising  Take a bike ride with your headphones on in some forest preserve trail orgs to a museum   Depression comes from boredom a lot of times and boredom is mostly caused by mental inactivity or lack of mental stimulation    Another thing I would recommend is the book "Zen and the Art of Happiness" By Chris Prentiss  Another one would be "A Manual for Living" by Epictitus     Relax    we all hit a slump at some point where you get depressed  there is a self loathing  a heaviness is there every morning you wake up     You'll bust out of it    Hope this helped  I remember at my old job i walked in on co workers talking to eachother  when i first entered in the room they stopped talking and kind of awkwardly looked around   I found out later that day that they were shit talking my hairline   These were people i kind of enjoyed working with because i thought they were cool with me   I was wrong to think these people were decent human beings   Why go out of your way to talk shit about someone   especially when theyre friendly and helpful towards you   I used to try and help people in my life but ive come to realize that people are nothing but fake worthless pieces of shit  Yeah japanese girls are notorious for effing white ugly foreign men 24 7 until they are sore  and then they pass them to their girlfriends just masturbate it off like everyone else  P Well they already don't speak much English  so that's a big problem already    girls on hearthstone  I'll do some of your housework  but I take only advance payment in the form of bjs  I'm so sorry  You don't have to be strong for others  grief gives you the right to be selfish  Grieve the way you want  if that's being strong because you want to then do it  if it means curling in a ball and crying for awhile then do that  I am so sorry you have to go through this   unattractive males   despite what feminists scream  it's actually males who have an incredibly varied appearance taste up to the extreme  while women have barely any variation from normal mainstream healthy good looks taste   I even saw on a webcam show a skinny woman with a ton of excess skin on her stomach  she must have lost a ton of weight too quickly  Her hair was short  she was sickly pale  By looking at her you'd have thought she was an ex obese cancer patient with some kind of cancer that eats your body away quickly  And yet there were thousands of men who not only were telling her she was beautiful  but they were choosing to look at her rather than any other free hot girl cam just one click away  Ask her out  If she says "No" and there is rejection you are going to have to live through it anyway   But rejection will happen more and more as you grow older   But it sounds to me like she would go out with you  Just be confident and if you haven't got any then fake confidence works good too   No  not necessarily  It depends on the personality of the girl  yes   I need a dog  I fucked up even worse  I slept with a guy who's in a sort of open relationship  We were super drunk  His girlfriend was sleeping next to us  in retrospect   what the fuck      But now he told me that this was breaking the rules  I thought we did something that was OK  now I'm an accomplice to something that could ruin their relationship    God  they really need each other   To make everything worse  I didn't even like it  It was horrible and and I feel both guilty and taken advantage of  I asked him several times if this was OK for heavens sake  Now everything is ruined and I can't even go to the toilet without it hurting like hell   So  if there's hope for me there certainly must be hope for you   Bs  Confidence does jack and shit for your personality  your tastes  your sensibilities  and jack is out of town   I can't tell you how relieving it is to hear that someone else out there has a similar problem  People often condemn me or call me sick and twisted or tell me to kill myself just for having an uncontrolled attraction  I've never acted upon anything  I keep the fantasies completely in my head  and yet somehow I am just as bad of a person as a murder  Please  give me a break  The world needs to wake up and see that being a pedosexual isn't a heinous crime  It's only a crime when fantasies are actively forced upon real children  Sigh  I could go on about this for hours   How many people do you swipe  You shuold use the chrome autoswiper   Most importantly  what did you do on your first date  Learn a language  it can lead to many benefits in the future  help with your studies and increase your employability        I feel exactly the same  That's why I won't reproduce and why I preach returning to the void by voluntary extinction  Thank you for the advice   I actually put Rich Dad Poor Dad on hold at the library recently   I will make sure to purchase it now though since it seems like a book I am going to want to read multiple times     I want an Intrinsic Field Subtractor  one can never know    And a very merry  unbirthday  to you   Like you  only in attractive  You are doing the right thing for yourself by doing this  Stay strong  May your decisions be supported and everything works for the better for your sake   No you are fucking 17  Everyone think their life sucks at 17  Thats called being a teenager   Thank you guys for the advice    If I were you I would rejoice in the fact you know fir certain what a scumbag this guy is even if nobody else does    And your cousin  I am sure she already knows this guy is a horny scumbag  To grab at a young chick at your Gf's family party is a pretty horny  scumbag thing to do   He has probably tried to bang half of her friends and everyone he works with     Whatever you decide to do  just relax and take a deep breath  It sounds like you are a very attractive woman and you are going to have to deal with over confident  douchebags drooling over you from time to time    Trust me  at one point in life these pathetic losers will make you laugh at their idiocy    This is also another reason why younger girls should get an education or some sort of job training so they are not reliant on alpha male dick heads   Since she's 17  he's asking someone underage for sexual photos  He could get into a lot of shit for that  Report him with the screenshots and maybe get some of the other girls to report him as well  Any reason why you didn't get the technician out  Then they can go and check through it all and make sure its all good    Sounds to always be on zone 7  might be worth setting up a camera at the sensor to film all night so you can see if anything is making it go off  and can check for sun   At least then you can see if it is something doing it  like the sun  or nothing doing it and you need a technician to see if some sort of timer on the device is faulty  Plus you'll have video proof of whatever it is  This is really not the sub for you  Make it out alive  In my humble opinion  true confidence springs out from authenticity rather than just pure success  Guys that do nothing but brag about themselves and act "confident" come across as fake at best and douchebags at worst  Granted  some women seem eager to date those types but I guess birds of a feather flock together  Not everyone is attracted to inflated egos with seemingly zero weaknesses  though  It's part of our natural instincts to also seek a sense of empathy in a partner because that's a crucial skill for parenting the common offspring  and there is no sense of empathy without any flaws and self doubt    How the fuck are you supposed to develop if you're failing all the time and you don't know why   But  alas  I don't know the answer to this  I struggle with zero self confidence myself  not that confidence matters much for an ugly woman's romantic chances but whatever   I just think it'd be better to approach this problem by substituting "how can I be more confident " by "how can I be more authentic to myself and people around me "    which  of course  takes incredibly more confidence when you have flaws and weaknesses to reveal than when you have not  Are you sure you're not using those opinions as a defense mechanism  At least for me I realized that most of the reason I was an introvert was because I didn't have any social skills  Telling other introverts  and myself  that I didn't want to socialize was actually just somthing I did to avoid the fact that I was scared  As I progress I get more outgoing and now I actually prefer to have plans during weekends   Also   small talk is necessary  If you never do it you never get to know people and you never know who you'll connect with at a less superficial level unless you do the superficial stuff first  I'd honestly tell him to divorce  It'd be hard  but I think he'd be much happier with another woman who ISN'T a bitch no offense   Also  like you said  sometimes people act this way because they themselves are guilty from seeing other people  so they try to dig up dirt on other people to make themselves feel less guilty   You will get a higher dose of radiation from walking down to the shops than you will from the cup  its fine  The reason I am not interested in getting the tech out is because I'll have to pay for a call out and he will simply replace the sensor   While this might work I'm already ahead of the curve there  I have just taken the sensors from my main bedroom window and swapped it for the ones on the zone 7 window    so let's see    The camera is a great idea but I need something to record onto  my computer and laptop were taken a burglary and robbery ago  respectively  I'll probably only get a new PC around the end of January but I will hook up a webcam for sure   Hi  I know I won't be able to convey much of my thoughts  I'm not a native English speaker as well  but all I want to tell you is I am with you  I was also a survivor of rape by a family friend when I was 4 5 years old  it happened for the whole school year while I was still in kindergarten  Another rape attempt by my brother in law happened to me when I was 13 years old  I didn't talk about what happened until I went to college  I kept things to myself for many years and I had to deal things alone  I was so damn afraid and embarrassed about it that I tried to forget and pretend that it never happened but as I grew older the thoughts or the guilty feelings came back to the point I was blaming myself about why it did happen  I understand the pain you are feeling today but please I want you to hold on  I don't want you to give up on yourself  I hope you seek professional help to talk you out on this  I know they can be able to help you dealing with all these things  Please don't give up   You will not be able to become a doctor  but you will still be able to become a nurse or a nurse's assistant  You know the woman that brings the bed pans in and out of the rooms  Hey  you can laugh but at least it's better than the guy who has to clean the bedpans  That poor sonuvabitch flunked three classes in High School and had to take summer school in third grade     LOL    No  It won't you will still be able to become a doctor    People fail classes in HS it happens      You should go talk to the counselor or teacher and explain the situation  Maybe they can take into account your situation and give you an incomplete or something you can make up    Also  you should really relax a bit  Stop over thinking the importance of stuff  I mean grades are very important and it is really cool that you are focusing on them and taking them seriously at this age  But also remember you are young and should be enjoying your youth a bit more   Stop worrying about the future so much and focus a bit more on the present   You'll pass the classes  you'll get through High School  you'll go to college    Hell by that time you may want to switch your major      It happens    Sounds like you're in good shape  Hope this helps    I am skinny and have puffy nipples and weak small muscles on the upper body  Stupid aromatase   C As a girl you have much higher chance of somehing happening and ppl being nice and interested in you and doing all the social legwork  Thus its much easier to convince yourself to go out coz once you do you dont have to do anything else  like approach ppl etc   As a guy you not only have to go out somewhere but once you do you have to keep working for something to happen so the motivation to go out is lower  I have all sorts of skin problems and skin allergies  both to regular stuff and to medication for skin problems    Well people are already dropping dead in China because of pollution  Overpopulation has been a thing for decades but it keeps multiplying  In 2016 the number of people who was born was more than twice the people who died  C LMAO when i read the beginning i was thinking "Fuck I'm so screwed " and i will most definitely and i'll start by going to a rave part in a month   Well in regards what I want  Online Business instead of current offline job  warehousing   Want to become incredibly social  working on that  Want to develop other skills  eg  music  language  knowledge  etc   So  yeah basically as much as possible  but the last couple of days  I have been doing pretty much nothing  except go out watch some fireworks on NYE     Life for me is basically go out to different places to have coffee  write some random stuff on my blog  read stuff on net  go back home  go to bed  I want to practice stuff   I plan to do it  but I never end up doing it   I am not a hard worker  but want to be one   he's just hating what life on earth is  but for the brain it's just too difficult for most people to hate "nothing   the way the world happened to be" so they hate people   made up gods  etc I had and possibly still have depression  Never let it affect my work ethic  life goals or social interactions  It looks like her attitude towards you stems from insecurity or weakness  possibly her depression and she's taking it out on you  which is a very shitty thing to do and also inexcusable   In all honesty  I think it is very hard to gain back respect once you lose it  If my partner said that to my face  I'd end things right then and there     I would argue that it is extremely important to remember that you are human and  in turn  make human mistakes  Even if it was real  you did not upload it  You clicked it likely out of curiosity  not because it's something you agreed with or supported  The fact that you watched it so long ago and still feel guilty shows that you are a caring person and would never wish that malice upon someone else  Everyone has done something stupid on the internet throughout the years of them using it  You have no one to apologize to  Forgive yourself  Human  being   and doubtful at best  You appear to have a sentient consciousness  but you certainly don't appear to have have much classical  humanity  about you  China is poor  as in population  and yet a huge contributor to pollution  Green economy leaders are first world countries  I was homeless as a young man in Canada a few times  The best thing I did for prospects was to head into the city  You might consider heading into London  where there are more employment opportunities and homeless relief options  Flat rental may be costlier there though  But the single piece of advice that I think might be most valuable is to go to the nearest benefits office and speak to an officer there  They can give you access to resources you will find very useful  including low income housing options  employment seeking aids  and perhaps some financial assistance  I'm not recommending you go on welfare  mind you  just that many people do not attempt to obtain government assistance until they are really down on their luck  Better to get solid advice there while you still have the benefit of a small amount of cash to your name  They will be eager to help someone who is clearly motivated to work and is at their offices primarily for advice and resources  This is such a naive way of viewing the world  dating by itself is sociopathic and manipulative by nature    High school   There is a question here that you have to honestly ask yourself  Some people ask it in 6th grade and have it all thought out  some people it hits later on  like in their 30's or 40's  Either way  you're going to have to face it and answer it honestly   And that question is  "What do you WANT to do "  and that means    what do you really REALLY REALLY want to do  You may have to get a bullshit corporate job in pursuit of what you really enjoy to pay off your shit  But just know you are very young     you have a lot ahead of you and you will most likely change careers a couple of times    Also  going to school is always a great option  Even if you are doing what you love for your job  still take classes in things and learn  It will help keep your mind alive and give you motivation    So  What interests you  Right now  what do you like  What would make you wake up excited to go to work every day   What would it take to get that job  If it means more school fine  if it means getting a better job to pay for the school fine    whatever it takes   Whenever it seems I got a lucky break and I won something or I get contacted by someone it's either someone selling their crap or someone trying to make connections to publicize their crap and they have no clue on what they are doing        goes to bookstore     picks up a pile of books and walks towards the cashier     Excuse me  can I ask you a question     Yes   omg  someone who reads stuff similar to mine      Where did you buy that shirt   dies inside  If you can't interact with other humans empathetically and without trying to manipulate them  that's your own fucking problem  Don't project your stupidity on the entire species  She seemed genuinely surprised from what I briefly saw  I'm just trying to compliment people more often and I don't want it to be weird  But how do you even do that  Throughout my entire life  I've always been that friend  The backup friend who nobody is that bothered about  Clearly it isn't them  it's me  To add to this  normies need to understand what a mental illness is  I'm not really sure if it part of someone  but it's definitely a real thing   "Just do it" is like telling a wheelchair bound person to "just walk it off"  it's insulting at the very least   Having a mental illness means your brain is disbalanced and that's where everything comes from  Maybe it is shaped by early experiences  but when you're missing something in your brain  you can't really develop it and use it on a whim  When you live your whole life in isolation  you learn to live by yourself  it's a survival instinct otherwise you won't make it  Going back to a tribal hivemind sort of thinking can't be done really   Stay in High School      You want to work in shit jobs the rest of your life  Stay in that fucking High School and get that diploma  And just so you know  you most likely will have to go to some sort of Junior College or Job training classes at some point in your life anyway    Whatever you do  do NOT drop out of school  It is the dumbest fucking thing a person could do and you will regret it   When I start losing my hair I'll just shave myself bald and grow a beard  Well he could be out there being eaten or roadkilled  so he's already ahead of almost any other animal lifeform on the planet being with you  I just wish people  not you  would stop buying animals  and adopt instead animals from animal shelters  since buying animals means that someone will breed more to sell them  or capture them if they are particular wildlife   If anyone's a big enough sleaze ball to grab the butt of their fiancee's cousin  which is so many levels beyond creepy and inappropriate   they deserve to get called out  and your cousin deserves to know what she's getting into before she commits to this creep  Give your family a chance  They may be more supportive than you're assuming  Aww  I do feel as though my lack of interest in sharing hearing opinions is possibly just a way for me to put up a shield  I get anxious about the idea of bringing people into my life  I would  like  friends and a circle of people that I like and like me back  but I find it kinda scary  So maybe I'm just not allowing myself to be liked because I find the idea of people in my life kinda scary  Funny how most women like cats  which are disrespectful abusive manipulative non reciprocating aloof animals that use you for food  and on top of that they also dare to scratch the hands that feed them  my dog was wonderful  but she died after 15 18 years    oh the fucking irony look who is projecting right now  if you can't fucking discuss without resorting to ad hominem attack then lock yourself up in a basement  The only way to know for sure is to email a colleague  or preferably the GM  And even if you've not been fired  you should obviously be looking for work  and complain to HR  humans have just a bunch of extra stuff they want and make up problems when they don't have any  while animals can be content with their life When I say you are a hero  I'm referring to the part where you turned in a family member for child porn  Here's what I'm trying to get across  the stuff with your brother will blow over one way or another  He may never speak to you again  Amy may do this again in a year and he realizes she's partly to blame  Who knows  All I'm sure of is that it will become a distant painful spot in your memory  not the bright all encompassing fire it is now   Your niece on the other hand    you saved her  Being abused as a kid can fuck you up for life  It creates demons in your head that you don't even know are there  You find them when they jump out and scare you years later  It's like constantly being haunted by ghosts that are invisible and weigh a thousand pounds  It's horrible  It creates a feeling of being damaged that you carry deep down forever  It becomes who you see yourself as  It is your reality   You stopped that path for that little girl  You made a choice to alter the trajectory of her life  You have no clue how much you did for her by turning him in  THAT is why you are a hero  What's an ACT  I'm not rich  but I have enough  I admit it  money is very important to my happiness  It's not enough by itself to create happiness  but it is very difficult to be happy without money    It's wonderful not to have to worry about having enough to pay the bills and rent  It's lovely to be able to buy as much food as I want at the supermarket  I love being able to go out to eat with friends and buy a round of drinks without checking my bank balance  It's fantastic to be able to save money towards my future  It's great to be able to travel abroad and pursue expensive hobbies  Last year I visited Cyprus  Iceland and Spain and I learned to paraglide  It's awesome to be able to buy decent gifts for my family at Christmas and birthdays  to own a car and drive it wherever I like  It's glorious to have a buffer of savings that's big enough that I don't worry about losing my job    There  are you satisfied  I've admitted it  I hope you too can have enough money to be happy one day  OP  its improbable  leave it to your destiny or fate  BTW there is an alternative  try searching for them on online sites with topics that interest you  let me give you an example   i am a game designer and i want designer friends so i would search them at E3  animation forums  digital art forums  or i would search them at my gamming institute   so search them at the place where you dwell The chances of getting pregnant from that are not impossible  but also very very unlikely  Taking plan B to quell your fears wouldn't be a problem  Are you on birth control  If so  unless you have something health wise that makes it a risk  you need to figure that out ASAP  Anyone regularly having sex should be on birth control  Non formal words do  however  decrease your perceived level of intellect  "Like  um  well"   try to train yourself out of using them   To increase the precision of your language  choose verbs that convey specific information    "He is really scared of shower curtain monsters" vs  "Shower curtain monsters terrify him"  Use verbs purposefully   it's an easy rule to follow  but improves your communication greatly   They might have been having the same arguments with the same threats for years and years  Remember they are under a ton of stress as well over this cancer thing   I would not worry about it  I know those are empty words that are easier said than done    As far as those worrisome thoughts you got to stop that shit  IMMEDIATELY      I'm fucking serious  Guard your thoughts away from thinking and thinking and overthinking and rethinking all the worst scenarios  None of them will happen and if they do they are never anywhere nearly as bad as you dreamed they were    A quote   "Your worst enemy cannot harm you as much as your own thoughts unguarded  But once mastered  no one can help you as much"  Empty your mind of these bullshit horror stories you are letting yourself dream up  They are pointless and they fuck with your emotions and reasoning ability    Just take it all as it comes  relax and breathe    Sorry your dad has health problems  Just be there for your parents and stay as positive as possible  Treasure the time you have with them and tell them 'I love you" all the time  Especially when your pissed or there is an argument happening  It seems to defuse the situation   I can't offer any advice about single parenting  or parenting in general  since I have not come to that point in my life yet  I will say however that if you would like to move back with your parents  you should strongly consider to tell them your future plans that way everybody is on the same page  Whether they support you or not after the adoption is final could obviously be a crucial moment in your life  You sound like such a kind person  I wish you much luck  This joke will never get old  I was on birth control last month after the condom breaking episode  but not this month  He was deployed in another country and came home as a surprise  Hadn't stocked up on condoms so didn't have piv sex  But is it safe to take plan b within two months of taking one  Having been poor in the past  and now more successful  I think this idea is a little misunderstood   As the other comment says  money does buy resources which does a lot to reduce stress   The thing is  human adapts quickly  The dreams of the past become the present's status quo  If people were always satisfied with just having food on the table then nothing in terms of scientific progress would've been accomplished   Now  poverty is fucking awful  Constant struggle for survival  It's granted very difficult to enjoy anything in life when you're constantly worried about having food and shelter the next morning   Once you get past that though  money provides diminishing returns  Once you own a house  a car and are financially stable  a little extra cash does nothing for you  If you're already able to travel once or twice a year  another vacation doesn't really add anything to your life   The quote I've heard though I can't remember where  a comedian  I believe  is that 'money doesn't buy happiness  but it makes unhappiness a lot more bearable'  I'd say that gets the point across much more accurately  I just recently joined a free salsa dance class  which I was incredibly crap at  but still enjoyed it   also going to join a basketball team  social  soon  new season starting this month and I've signed up already   and am currently working on a good idea for starting business  I want at least something that can make me a constant small amount of money from today  and another business that I can consistently work on so it can replace my income one day    One of my plans was to go to as many as social events as possible  1 per day   but my issue with that is   if I did that  I would get no time to improve skills if I spend all my time out   also would take a lot of money  Those people that say that shit are people who won't get a job in Communications     You on the other hand should do what feels right and what you are most excited about pursuing    Stop worrying about what the other douchebags say  I went to aFilm school in my 30's and got a degree and I have worked on Movies   Tv ever since   But everyone said it was a useless degree     they are the ones that never did a thing in the industry and film weddings and commercials now     So  don't listen to the douchebags who say you're wasting your time  That's just an idiotic toxicity spread around be people content to fail by never trying   I spent  50 on Aquariam tickets to get flaked on today  Sucks   In my first remotely real relationship of a few months right now  I apologised for probably snoring and was met with something like this    Mention it tomorrow if they know they snore  They'll appreciate that it doesn't bother you and feel all appreciated     I can relate a lot with this feelings as i am myself bipolar  You are a strong person and I am proud of you for admitting you need help  Best wishes OP maybe 120 was 120 seconds  which probably happened during the poop at all  so maybe he did I think the same  I need an answer  Only with her answer can I move forward  Together or alone    I can't thank you enough for taking the time to read my post  Knowing that there is someone else in the world who would take the time out of their day to contribute to what I had to get off my chest is a truly wonderful feeling  You are a good person and have given so much more than I could have ever asked of you  Thank you    leaves to check news  I don't think anything I said means that those reasons can't be reasons as well  Based on what he has said  looks is easily one of the most important things to him  and doing that is dangerous  Even if being alone is one of the reasons  that's equally just as important to acknolwedge that it is DANGEROUS  It's SO dangerous  I was totally harsh in my response  and that's because I've been there and no one told me to get my shit together  and I suffered for it  I don't think anything in my comment SHAMED him  besides the dog thing  maybe  which I find completely important to do because his dogs are suffering and I can't justify letting other creatures be hurt because of something like fear in these kinds of situations   this isn't what this is about  It's about acknowledgement and understanding that this can get worse  And he needs to recognize it  or it WILL get worse    OP  if you feel ashamed from what I've written  fucking don't be  I wouldn't be with my current SO if I didn't think he wasn't attractive  No way in HELL  We're all shallow in that aspect one way or another and I don't think that should be used as a reason to stick with someone who is hurting you SO much    Take it as advice from someone who also thought looks were what mattered the most  and ended up being used by those who took advantage  Learn to stand up for your personal boundaries  and at the end of the day  do what is right for YOU  I didn't owe anything to anyone  If you were in my position you wouldn't have gone either  Should've invited yourself for New Years   This person sounds the literal worst friend in the world    Paragraph 1 is an obvious sign she doesn't give a shit and if she isn't ever inviting you or asking on your behalf is she really a friend   I wouldn't worry about it at all  But in the future make sure you're stocked up since you seem to worry a lot  Okay so I'm guy  2  but only one girl has said yes and that was decades ago when I was 18  One other girl said yes but then canceled and reunited with old boyfriend after giving me the green light for two weeks  My only girlfriends have been ones who asked me out  This one is from my uncle who has a bunch of them  our previous one was from the store  It's funny how I tell not to buy me pets but get them all the time  "Do you want a guinea pig " NO  "Okay  here's one " She got sick after a few years and died  The last weeks were torture  I tried to feed her with a syringe but she was getting thinner and thinner  Then my sister in law got me a hamster as a surprise  NO  NOT ANOTHER PET  He got a tumor  and guess what happened next  I got George  It seems like parents try to make me feel not so lonely  I never leave the house  ever  Maybe once a year  I never talk to anybody on the phone  I don't have any online friends  Pets don't help  I wish I could go completely insane and not be aware of anything  FOCUS on the present and not on the past  The past happened already  Focus on the present and move forward      However  I guess my advice would only be valid based upon the severity of the past sins   If you like murdered someone and buried them in the woods    My answer would be to call the police  They can help         Hey sorry    I hope I didn t confuse you more  But stop focusing on the past   We all have disasters we would like to go back and change but that can't happen and life moves forward so we should focus on right now  be the best person RIGHT NOW who would NEVER repeat those sins from the past  If thoughts about it creep into your head    make certain you think about something else    even if you have to look at porn     focus on other shit    Gosh I hope I helped   Don't lie about your life  If you don't feel like you have something to contribute just congratulate her on her brags and move on    She sounds awful  Did I mention that already  I would've  Even if it didn't work out it's experience   While she may seem more wolf ish than dog ish  releasing her into the woods or something would basically guarantee her death  Dogs are  not  wolves  and are not meant to be in survival mode like that  They are domesticated animals  Please don't release your dog into the wild   Stop fucking drinking     Best advice you could give yourself   What happens in college is the guys you used to get totally fucked up with are people you cut loose after a while because you are sick of their shit     the stories about "How fucked up we were" get old and boring         However  keep drinking like a stooge and you WILL BECOME one of those people in their 40's getting fucked up and repeating the same bullshit stories over and over again with nothing surrounding you but other fucking ex friends of people who also were cut loose by their good friends    Also  I would constantly be apologizing to this guy  Explain how much this is bothering you and how much of a dick you feel like  Do it one on one and apologize a lot   Losing a friend and humiliating them is a humiliating and nasty scar you never get over the shame of       OP sounds confident about lots of things Again   if you're like me you possibly don't believe in yourself and that you have anything of value to offer people  Assuming that's the case it would make sense to not want anyone in your life  Why invite people to see how utterly useless you are  It could be a good idea to work on your confidence  and force yourself to get out there so you discover that people are usually quite nice  It's a post factum rationalization   That's all  Never did this as strong as you and since a few years it's completely changed  Nowadays I mostly see the flaws in all those 5 10 guys and girls and I'm instantly repelled in disgust  On very rare occasions I see a young  obviously rich  and attractive dude my age overtaking my shitty old car on the road in a new Challenger or some similar nice vehicle and I just think "this guy got the life " and smile  But with most people I just recognize how mundane they are  It should be fine  You can probably search for this sort of thing about Youtube and Reddit  I'll be sure to stop by and link what I find   EDIT 1  The Art of Manliness   Small Talk https   youtu be IiQA3XSw5UM Covers a variation of the FORD method  Make sure to practice with other people first  Small talk is great way to expound relationships  even non romantic ones  And besides  if you're

an Introvert as an Introvert https   www reddit com r LifeProTips comments 5ddeoc lpt request how to talk to a introvert when youre  ref search posts May not entirely apply to you  but it has some important takeaways  Insteading of saying "um " "well " "gee " or similar filler words  be silent  It makes you seem  feel  and be a bit more intelligent  If you have issues shaking it off  repeat it several times   e g  "Um  sure "     "Um um um um um sure "  It helps you realize its a bit goofy and makes it easier to break the habit  Also  when prompted to speak  especially in a quiet or aekeard situation  you don't have to jump to a response  You don't have to be constantly talking or listening to appreciate someone's presence  Even if they were from Fukushima they would be fine  Millions of people live in Nagasaki and Hiroshima  and many of them are senior citizens in good health  You aren't going to get sick from a cup bought from there   it looks like the entire board commited collective suicide  You need to discuss this with an academic advisor or someone similar at your school  The policies and procedures for stuff like this are not universal enough to get you good answers on the internet  So you almost beat someone to death  then you raped your girlfriend    I can't imagine why people want to kill you     Definitely tell your terapist about it   In the case of psychosis   things can quickly get much worse  Hope it works out good for you      "how can I be more authentic to myself and people around me "    which  of course  takes incredibly more confidence when you have flaws and weaknesses to reveal than when you have not   Yeah  this is definitely an issue I have  I'm scared of letting people truly get to know me  in case they find out how much of a flawed person I really am  This of course means people never get close to me and I make friends with difficulty  Not having close relationships with people leads to a lack of confidence  which makes me even less able to truly let people get to know me for who I actually am  It's a vicious circle really    Hobbies   I like Toastmasters  but meetup com lists lots of hobby groups    I want to know more of George    I have gone through almost exactly that but possibly for different things   Mines GAD  BPD  Depression and Social Phobia    Anywho  Its hard to offer advice with knowing so little but deffinately talk to your therapist or doc about it   I was put on lexapro for depression and it also helped greatly with my GAD and Socialphobia   I ended up going off of it and I have found that CBT  cognitive behavioral therapy  works wonders   Next time you feel that way take a momment and breathe and then ask yourself  is there really something there or is it in my head   Is everyone really staring at me or is it just me being self concious about        fill in the blank   Take a momment and work through it and rationalize the problem out   Its simple but hey  CBT is supposed to be just as effective as some antidepressants  or atleast thats what my doc told me  so good luck and deffinately talk to your therapist next chance you get  maybe email them or write this out in detail and give it to them before your next apt  to give them a heads up       If I just focus on me  PEOPLE FUCKING IGNORE ME      it's like this for every average looking male  How do you get food  Are you hikkikomori and unemployed  When it happens my mind gets stuck in that thought  The whole process in the simple terms is that the thought is brought on by something and I begin getting a sense of tunnel vision and like the floor is vanishing under me  Then there's the horrible nausea that comes on and feeling like my stomach is twisting in on itself  Add on to this I go through a panic attack  and my mind is stuck on that 'trigger' then for a while as I have to force myself to focus on something else which can take up to an hour at times   I'm mostly a 'go with the flow' kinda girl  To be honest I don't even know  it's a bit of not being there anymore and just what could happen after death occurs  Hopping onto this pretty late  but as cool as those things are it sounds like you might be lacking spontaneity in your life  Dancing and exercising sound great a couple days a week  but what if you switched out one day at the gym or one dance class for spontaneous you time once a week  During this time you could decide to go ziplining with some friends  visit some parks if you're into nature  try new types of ethnic foods in or around your area  explore your locale  take a trip to the city country  even sit inside and catch up on movies  video games  or books you've been meaning to get to  etc   etc  I could make this list go on and on  but just remember that the amount of time we have on this planet is limited  Make use of the time you have and don't bore yourself at such a young age with a loaded repetitive schedule while you can still be active and spontaneous   If your job offers leave vacation and you are able to  you could try to save up enough money to plan trips to exotic lands and resorts  You would be amazed at how much you could see in just a day in another country  This could be something you look forward to so that in the middle of your year you do not catch yourself asking the same question in this post   Life is amazing  Experiences are hard to forget  With so much to do and see  I would argue it is impossible for people to get bored of the great planet Earth I realised when reading your story that I also can remember all non formal social interactions I had in the last few years because there are so few   I was wondering if you too anticipate the conversations you might have in those events beforehand   Anyone regularly having sex should know the risks involved  proper use of contraceptives  and how ovulation works  For 26 year old  there Is quite a bit of ignorance   While it's not entirely impossible  the probability of the remainder sperm making it from the outside of your vagina to the inside  and high up to fertilize your egg is highly highly improbable   A man's ejaculate usually has 40 300 MILLION sperm  10 million sperm mL and you're getting into infertility territory    You said it was wiped off  so the numbers you're looking for is minimal  No worries there  Most outer sperm coaugulates  and dies within 20 minutes in open air conditions  While it can live up to 5 days inside the perfect conditions  ie inside the birth canal  it usually dies quickly being in unaccommodating conditions  So just educate yourself if you're doing something continually  especially if it includes heavy consequences like childbirth  If You knew your cycle  and both of You are std free you could've had unprotected sex with no pregnancy resulting because your egg was either dropped or hasn't left the fallopian tubes And wasn't ready to be fertilized  As risky As that sounds  it's possible  Again  You have to know What you're doing  Dude  stay away from this chick    she is drowning in a sea of bullshit drama and she'll gladly take you with her   stop focusing on her bullshit problems  You're not with her anymore  Yes she has a place in your heart but the uncle molestation thing is quite frankly none of your fucking business anymore    Go to see a therapist  start transcendental meditation  go fishing  focus on positive things and flush all the negative toxic drama from this chick and her family out of your head  It's not healthy and it will fuck you up if you let it get to you      There are plenty of chicks out there without anywhere near the drama the you could have a healthy relationship with  But if I were you I would stay single for a while     You need some time to reevaluate and lick your wounds  and purge out all the bullshit  immature anger  It'll kill you   there are many "non fa" who got lucky a couple of times and have been with their partner for a long time  and when the couple breaks they spend years or decades alone before getting lucky again I've never heard anything  and couldn't find anything after a quick cursory google search  When you go to pick it up from the pharmacy  just mention that to the pharmacist to see what they say  Exactly  The concept of gaining confidence through positive experiences is pretty simple  but for some reason a lot of people don't seem to understand it  People who've always been confident tend to assume that their confidence is just a character trait or that it comes from within  without thinking about the experiences that shaped that confidence  A bigger issue is that because they had positive experiences  they assume we will too  if we just keep asking out women  we will eventually be successful  That's how it worked for them  so that's how it works for everybody  right  For two decades  I have been Guy 2  I'm still a virgin at the age of 48   Confidence comes from an external validation of our internal beliefs  It is based on merit and the results of our actions  External results prove that we are capable of achieving that which we achieved  Once we have accomplished something  that result is hard evidence and one feels confident the task can be repeated  Not only that  but the confidence is often further applied to similar tasks and challenges  In this way  confidence builds on itself and the person who has succeeded sees more success   If I tell myself "I am a great student  I get over 100 on every test" so many times that I believe it  yet I keep getting back scores in the 30s and 40s  all I am doing is lying to myself  The results do not validate my beliefs  and no one would seriously say "well  all you have to do is believe stronger to get the results" and no good teacher would say "well  since you believe that you get over 100 on every test  I'll give you a 100 on this test " All the self talk and pseudo faith would not raise my scores one single bit  You do not legitimately get a score of 100 on a test just because you believe that you will  no matter how sincere that faith and belief is   People who are blind don't suddenly see just because they believe they can see   And in the rare cases where they truly believe they can see  it is a medical condition called  Anton Babinski Syndrome  https   en wikipedia org wiki Anton E2 80 93Babinski syndrome    Telling me that I need to have more confidence is like telling people who are blind that they are not really blind  they just have to see  even to the point of using people with Anton Babinski as examples of how to be confident that one can see while blind  and claiming that eventually that fake vision would transform into true vision   Fake confidence often comes across as an "I'm better than everyone else" arrogance  instead of someone who humbly knows from past results that they are capable of completing the task set before them   Women are extremely good at cutting through bullshit false confidence  No matter how well I present myself  no matter how well I was coached  no matter how many times I practiced what to say and how to behave  it failed or backfired  If a woman doesn't want to be friends or have a relationship with you  she will either outright tell you from the start or give you excuse after excuse for why she can't   Forgot to add this but heres some info about cbt  might want to ask them about it   https   youtu be 9c Bv FBE c Maybe talk to people first  and compliment them during the conversation  Just complimenting someone you don't know might come across as a bit creepy  Thanks      I have personally been told that PTSD is a lifelong disorder that can only be treated with coping mechanisms but not cured  I use medicine and therapy and it's helped with my symptoms but I won't be able to function without those things for the rest of my life  Also  I imagine that the ability to maintain obese in a social situation exists on a spectrum  In other words  even "normal" people cannot be social forever and are limited by time  energy  etc  At what point does it become pathological  In my case I know it is because other people point it out and because I'm limited by it socially  Try social dancing  Take ballroom classes and watch your life improve  Perhaps it is the shoes and not you  How long has it been since you have gotten a new pair of shoes OP  In my experience smokers generally understand the risks and that it's detrimental to their health  As a result don't take well to people "telling" them to stop  By all means though  a casual word to show your concern will at least let him know that you care   Talk to your local council for advice and assistance   Check out gumtree for people looking for a lodger    Go to the job centre to get advice on employment  Or a local college if you want to complete your education  and see if they have any monetary support options   If you're no longer in education  I'd suggest trying to get on an apprenticeship scheme   If you have some gcse's or a levels perhaps try some job agencies too for temp work   Ideally you'll want to gun for university if that's an option   and there's a lot of financial assistance available   talk to their bursary office   I think you could be right that your mother might be cheating  it is a symptom of people doing that to blame the other person to take the heat off themselves    But  until you know that for certain there is nothing you can do about it   Sounds to me like your mother could use some help emotionally and mentally   Is there any way you guys could get together and explain she is delusional and needs help   Promise her it would make her and everybody else happy     I mean   who knows      But the other option is for your father to just divorce her and move on    Also  if your father is watching porn and meeting other women    more power to him    It sounds like he could use some decent porn  Wear full gear into the shower  This is rough  I'm so sorry you have to go through this  I don't know all the context of why you broke up and all that so I won't start to presume  I know you would have done anything for her but unfortunately that's not an option anymore and it sucks  I really hope things get better for you mate  I'm in a similar boat to you and it hasn't got any easier for me after 3 months so I know how difficult it is to see anything else  Hey dude just remember first and foremost  your dad will just want you to be happy and do well in life  I'm sure he is an intelligent man who would understand that you can't take him around the world and tick off a big bucket list as a 20 yr old student  but he wouldn't be fussed by that  What he would want is your emotional support and you to do your best in life and see where that takes you     One thing is for sure  cherish every moment you have with him from now on regardless of how much longer he is with you  When you've written ' I want him to really enjoy himself no matter the outcome and for him to understand that he is very much loved '  don't feel bad that you can't heap him with expensive presents and trips  All he would want from you as his son is love  support and spending some time together and you can always give him that      Wish you guys the best  I know I'm an internet random but I'm always around for a PM  Just wanted to share how similar our stories are  Overdosed on citalopram in January last year  currently on fluoxetine and feel a lot better but still not perfect Oh god I remember this feeling like it was yesterday  Excruciating  bewildering amounts of pain  then just a tiny amount of morphine went into the IV and it was like someone had just flipped the switch for the pain to "off"  I was just a normal person again   Shit is spooky  Yes Yeah  and forever sever the relationship  Hmm    I got this same tip during therapy  Did'nt really work for me  but that does'nt mean it won't work for you  Read  Write  Practice   I think she is being over the top  When I think of my new years  at two minutes past friends were still hugging  saying happy new years  celebrating  Had I have rushed off to send a text would have completely ruined the moment  She is having no understanding that you were actually with other people in another context  She's thinking quite selfishly  You have done nothing wrong  15 minutes would be reasonable to start to feel a little disappointed  And I mean a little  Are you still in high school  Your parents aren't angry at you because they hate you or anything  I know it can be hard to realize but your parents obviously want to spend time with you  which they can't really do if you are playing games 8 hours a day and spending the rest of it at school or sleeping  Heavy gaming whilst at school can impact both grades and health in a negative way  as addictive and fun as they can be I think your parents do have a point and perhaps you need to cut back  Sounds to me like she could be suffering from some lingering postpartum depression  I'll admit  I get this way with my husband sometimes  and our son just turned 2 last month   When I get that way  it's because I'm not thinking clearly  I'm barely able to think 2 minutes into the future  let alone a whole day  I realize that the house is a wreck  I'm exhausted  but I have to go to work  My husband can be pretty lazy and a bit of a slob  so the messy house doesn't bother him  but I get upset because he doesn't notice  What I'm really upset about is that he can't read my mind and that his standards aren't mine   Maybe try to talk things out with your wife  Try couples therapy or individual  Either way  it sounds like you guys aren't on the same page emotionally  You would be much better off asking this in r fitness Thank you  She's mentioned the possibility of me having depression multiple times and has told me  as well as another mental health professional  that medication would be beneficial  Unfortunately  I can't take said medication due to familial issues  I also have trouble because this tends to come in weird cycles  like my depression   She has mentioned CBT and has already started telling me to kindof look into it  I just tend to get really freaked out about it when it's at its worst  because much like last night I don't sleep at night and end up staying up because of this weird paranoia feeling  I'be talked to my friends about it and they don't know much on it so they can't provide a lot of advice  But thank you again  It'a honestly helped me feel a little less afraid and I will definitely look into it   Not much more we can say except you need to make an effort  and no it wouldn't be weird to message those people after time has passed  c'mon man they wanted to help you out  They would most likely appreciate you messaging them back        Always here if you need a PM mate Family disputes are the worst  thank you for your kind words  Very interestingly  yes  Especially if you are different that the people surrounding you  It shows that you are willing to display yourself in your tastes as opposed to someone else's in search for cheap validation  AKA confidence  And people like confident individuals  Read up on Ralph Waldo Emerson and "Self Reliance " Being yourself independent of others' deconstructive criticism is a major social asset  He's in emotional pain right now  He has got to get used to rejection     and it is not easy   If he tosses back a few drinks  fine  If it starts fucking up his life     then you should worry yourself  But as of right now  he's fine  He has just gotten a huge chunk of life to chew on and it growing up    Also  these "rejections" happen to all of us all the time  You do get used to it so it doesn't feel as big a personal  heartbreaking insult  But the only way to purge that immature heart ache shit is to live through it  You never know  He may meet the love of his life at a bar     Why did you go to a different doctor if your sister is board qualified to determine your prescription     Or is your sister not an eye doctor    Get your glasses  If you don't like your vision after wearing them  go back to the doctor   What do you want  Do you want a healthy relationship with your gf   If you were single  i would say go for it  And Hop out if anything goes awry  Keep at it if all parties involved are enjoying it    BUT  You have a gf    Would she be ok with this  Have you talked exclusivity and boundaries  If you do this with them  and say nothing to your gf    And you're not in an open relationship as far as she knows  you're a piece of shit    Let me phrase it in a way you can understand  Why be in a limiting thing like a closed relationship  when you can be single  with multiple FWBs  and threesomes with hotties  as you put it   Don't be a scumbag  Talk to your gf about the offer  respect What she says  and decide What you want  Don't do anything behind her back  But If she opposes  you can choose to love and respect her  stay with her and only her  you can lie and have your way and hope she doesn't find out  or you break off the relationship and do ss you please   But you can't have both unless you want to become a piece of shit indeed   Can you really not think of anything to ask that interests you  Maybe you're not of a really curious nature  I think that a lot of the time when I have conversations with people and I ask questions it's really my curiosity speaking  especially when I don't care about a person much       For example  recently I was changing career paths and I was trying to figure out what job I'd want to do  Cue me having conversations with people about what they were studying in their career to learn more about different jobs  I must have sounded really interested in what they did but in fact it came from a selfish desire to get more info       Now though I think that it's pretty fun to have that kind of conversation with people regardless so I tend to still do it  I guess I've come to enjoy it       What I'm saying is that if you make an effort to actually ask questions and try to be interested in other people maybe you'll find that you actually enjoy it more than you thought  I'm constantly baffled by how much more I actually care about other people than I thought I did  I mean  back in high school I was way more cynical uninterested in other people but as I've broken out of my shell and actually had more interactions I realized that a lot of my preconceptions about myself other people were wrong  That's what's great about putting yourself out there and learning about the world  you learn about yourself as well  If I could hug you I would  It will get better  I promise    Oh my gosh  I can relate so much to that  I'm so sorry this happened to you  I know how it feels to do something without thinking  and have it turn out being a complete disaster  Heck  I can think about what I'm going to do in a certain situation for an entire year  and still have things turn out horribly   Think about things that they did for you that you really appreciated  Don't take out your emotions ON your friends  not to be misunderstood as talking about your feelings   Tell them that you appreciate them and their help in the past and present  Be there for them when they need you  Solid  straight forward advice  although a little general  I'll keep it in mind  I'd rather not go into specifics unless it's beneficial on my behalf  sorry  Apart from keeping a fresh mind  how can running and reading be beneficial  She sounds like she has attachment problems  like she's very insecure in your relationship and needs constant validation you love her  It sucks because she probably doesn't realise what affect this is having on you as you're clearly trying to make things work with her  I'm wondering if anything bad happened to give her these trust issues with you  either in this relationship or in the past  Unfortunately I don't think there's anything you can do to fix things  it's just one of those things that she has to work out on her own  You're not in an easy situation here  I'm sorry to hear about your situation friend Sounds like a habit  i would suggest choosing something to chew with as a distraction like gum  Parents buy food  duh      hikikomori  a person who avoids social contact  I don't avoid it on purpose  I'm just too depressed anxious to do anything  including going outside or working  I'm dying from loneliness  The Japanese Ministry of Health  Labour  and Welfare defines hikikomori as people who refuse to leave their house and thus isolate themselves from society in their homes for a period exceeding six months  You get to learn  move on and try to do better  This is only a page in your book  it doesn't have to define you  Don't let it  She's not a doctor    she just saw and was like shit ur blind    I thought about it but    shit they're expensive from where I am from so I need advice on what to do  Thank you for the advice  much appreciated  I'll try to inform myself of any all my options before making any real decisions  Wtf do you mean by how is reading and exercise is benificial   Dude He also goes by the name Joe or Joseph  they all sound similar to him  Latest trick I taught him  he climbs on my foot  I lift him up a few inches and he chews his treat in the air  Thanks   He does know I hugged these guys from my group  I told him  and I did tell him that while I like them in a friendly way like they're fun etc and drunk hugging attention seeking is fun  I love him more than anything in the world and he told me he loved me   Also  it was all new to me because we had been together for 10 days and it's my first boyfriend but now we're 3 months together and going strong    We did define the boundary for cheating  we decided that it was a kiss on the lips but hugs kisses in other places  well not sexual  were allowed  Again  thanks for your advice     He sounds like a fucking scumbag  you need to ditch this guy  All of those plans are good  just gotta keep going with them    no other mental disorder  I've got tons of them  Hikikomori is not the right term  Maybe nutjob   I have no social skills  but I am still relatively confident  that means I am not afraid of showing what I am  Thank you so much for helping me and giving me a real answer that makes sense to me i should start thinking about the "if i dont want to hang out with myself why would anyone else want to hang out with me" and also the part where you spoke about the dymamic of your and your friends relationship made me think that this might be the case  But either way ill just keep on working on bettering myself in order to become a more interesting person to converse with thanks again  Have you spoken to any foster agencies yet  See if their are any groups or agencies around you could speak with  they may be able to answer questions and explain the process  Thank you for your concern  Is this advice for food on the go or cheap food to make at home  Regardless  I'll keep it in mind    I think I'll check out  r personalfinance and see if they can shed any light on the situation  Wow    I do believe your friend has some sort of a personality disorder  I was ready to chalk it all up to immaturity  how old are you both  From the clues in your post  I'm guessing teenagers       but given what you said about her telling you you're ugly  then taking it back  then telling you that more people would care if she died  instead of you  or did she mean that more people would care if YOU died  Not sure      I really do think she has some sort of personality disorder   I think she probably does really love  or at least care for you  but whatever mental emotional problems she's dealing with makes it hard for her to treat you well at all  The things she's doing saying to you and other people show me that she has very little empathy for other people  evident of narcissistic personality disorder  borderline personality disorder  or sociopathy    my guess is on borderline personality disorder  Look up the symptoms of borderline personality disorder  and also narcissistic personality disorder  and I think you'll find many common themes  and also may give you some clues into WHY she is the way she is  and why her mind works that way     And just remember that if she can't change  and continues to treat you like this  then it's perfectly acceptable to end your friendship with her  Not out of spite or bitterness  but just for your own mental emotional well being  I've been in friendships like this  and they are toxic to your mental health and self esteem  You don't deserve to be treated like that  personality disorder or not  You sound like a good friend  and deserve to be valued and treated well  will kindness  compassion  and respect  There are horrible people in the world  some of us happen to get born to them   I am so sorry honey  A look of haughty derision works for me  I dont agree with your objective list  For religion you included atheism but excluded islam and catholicism I'm 33 and live with my family  I love it here  but I have lived other places  I lived in Florida for school  then moved back home and had some apartments and moved around to the east and west coast and back  Home is where the heart is  I feel grounded here  I feel blessed  Sometimes I feel like a weird loser because I am in my 30s and live with my parents  but I work and do have goals  I just can't really afford to move out yet and I'd rather not be alone  Can relate  Whenever I tried to make friends or try to have a genuine conversation with someone I feel like they're giving me signals that they have to be elsewhere or with someone else  Even here on reddit  I barely get any kind of interest  Sucks that my life isn't interesting or exciting enough for people  Honestly she deserved someone to tell her these things  people who are cruel deserve equal  I hope you are okay and things get better for you  your Dad and your little sister  No  not at all   You are strong  you are brave  You are your own man abd you are not defined  by the actions of this horrible peace of shit   Stick with a set sequence  Practicing the same poses every day repeatedly is a powerful way to keep consistent with your practice  This repetition offers you a clear vantage point from which to watch yourself grow and change  The nature and sequencing of Ashtanga Yoga offers this beautifully  You dont have to think about what pose you want to do next  so instead you can focus on your breath  bandhas and drishti  This takes you into a deeper meditative and focused place  so that you will step off your mat feeling more present and peaceful  Thanks for the advice      Granted  I didn't say it  but I haven't sat down with them yet  I'm just gathering ideas so I don't get blind sided or even ask too much    If you think I'm asking too much maybe you could  I dunno  say "Your asking too much  insert advice "    This is r advice right  Or did I stumble into AskReddit   Considering posting this question  reading resumes or even posting your own over in  r resumes     Yeah  what makes you think it isn't  Sexual harassment  is  something serious  I mean I've could've done worse things  but that doesn't make it any better  Well  talking about it helps  Writing this helped  Thanks for listening  Sometimes our instincts get the best of us  unfortunately   Oh fudgenuggets I thought I did good with my single 36 and overall 33    Goddamn way to go  You earned your bragging rights   "I've never thought about it that way but now that you mention it  it makes sense  Cats   Chads" I feel this way too  When I told my psychiatrist  he said "Of course that's how you'd feel  you've got anxiety "  No  it's not weird   I do it often   It's pretty acceptable  if you are all in a group chat to text others in that chat directly   I've never found it weird whenever somebody does it to me    I'm so sorry for your loss  You need to do whatever you feel is right to grieve and fuck who tells you otherwise  A test in the US that colleges look at for entrance  Ace the ACT and you can get into most colleges  My brother got a 34 36 way back when we were in high school and was accepted everywhere he applied  I never took the ACT  just the SAT  which is different but has the same purpose  Being a basement dwelling drop out is not going to magically be "less stressful" or make things better with your family  It will actually do the opposite  I'm sorry that happened to you  Your best friend wasn't being a friend when she catfished you  so you need to either cut off or severely limit your interactions with this person  Have you talked to either of them yet  I don't think you should feel bad about it  you have done what's in your power  The person who lied and  sort of cheated on his GF is him  You  have been  taken advantage of   But hey  2017 can only get better from this point    There are many other types of fish in the sea  Hello OP    I know it might not seem like it  but you're incredibly strong  The fact that you're admitting to and getting help for an illness often perceived as shameful shows that you love your husband and child very  very much  and want to be the best mother and wife you can be  I would like to share something from my own life   My mom was in the exact same situation as you are now  I was born just 17 months after my older sister  and the stress that comes with caring for a toddler and a newborn flared up her bipolar depression to a point where she considered ending her life  just like you   She loved my sister and I very much and she wanted to be the very best mother she could  but she didn't get any help until her and my dad divorced  At the time I was maybe 3 4 years old  my sister 5 6  and we knew that mommy was very  very sad sometimes  Our home life wasn't the best as my mother self medicated when she was depressed  but she truly tried her best to give us a normal childhood   She decided to get help after an episode of severe  crippling depression and suicidal thoughts  and she later told me that my sister and I were the only reason she kept fighting this awful illness  an illness that threatened to take away my mother  a mother so dedicated to her children that she  despite the overwhelming stigma and shame attached to bipolar depression  any mental illness really   got the help she so desperately needed   It was a difficult and long struggle  but she worked hard and tirelessly  and with the help and support from friends  a great therapist and medication she got better and took control of her life  something her illness stole from her    Get the help you need  It won't be easy  but you can't go on living with a warzone in your head  emotionally torturing yourself  This merciless illness almost took my mother and my childhood from me  but it doesn't have to end like that  You're not alone  your suffering doesn't make you weak  and you can get better  No one can take the first step to recovery but you   same A lot of great advice here  tysm  I have some A levels and GCSE's  university has never really appealed to me so if I am presented with a choice I'd rather work  but I'll keep it in mind for sure  I've had a few near death experiences and they resulted with me having a few existential  crisis here and there   It helps if you just sit back and focus on the moment  I try art therapy or some phone games like stack or loop   Worrying about what will or can happen is irrelevant  All you can control is the present moment  he didn't think much past his feeling of bitterness Unless he  or she  isn't into girls       Where are you based  Why kind of products are you going to sell  What's going to be your focus  I don't think my wife thinks my snoring is cute  But she tolerates it and doesn't complain about it much  and I guess that's about all I can ask of her      As others have said  this is not your fault   That being said you have two options as I see it    Either you keep quiet and hope it doesn't happen again  which is unlikely since you haven't done anything yet he will think its fine   The other option is to tell your cousin  This is the route I would recommend because whilst it may sour your relationship with your cousin temporarily  it tells the fianc its not ok plus it will mean your cousin keeps a closer eye on him  Once a slime ball  always a slime ball  I guarantee this isn't the first time   I sincerely you get the opportunity to move away or cut these poisonous people out of your life   Don't pay for it  It'll be a wake up call that she needs to get her problems in order instead of threatening suicide and having meltdowns in public for hours  I'm going through something similar except im the friend who is losing interest  I'm trying to hold onto this friendship but its only making things worse   My suggestion is to let it go and if its meant to be it'll come back  Hang out with other people or join some clubs  It's not a bad thing  its just a part of growing  O O wow

still active   like thesimpledollar   Can't remember the other ones    but they discuss tips for saving  budgeting  how to pay down debt  or better yet avoid it in the first place   Basically  spend less than you earn   Finally lost my FA status at 34 in 2016  My way out was by making a lot of close friends  becoming a very socially active person with them  and finally one of them brought a coworker out with us and she and I hit it off  We've been dating a couple months now  spent New Year's together  and we are going away for a weekend soon so it does feel like things are going well    And if people tell me I wasn't FA because I have a gf now  they're idiots  I was a fucking kissless virgin until 34  yes  that's why kind men are fucked  but not in the why they'd like  In my country males are really fucking aggressive for no reason and women act extrafeminine for no reason and do shit tests all day and you're supposed to tell them to fuck off but    why   why can't be all kind to each other and have sex after respecting each other   Nice to see local folks  I live downtown Ville Marie Second the workout  my anxiety is palpably different on the days o don't work out vs the days I do  How come you ended up in ER for kidney stones  It's no problem  Accidents happen  and I'm always willing to listen to a post like this  Mostly because this is  unfortunately  an accident that society is not easy at forgiving  Then again  when is society forgiving  I swear  sometimes it feels like you have to be perfect in this world  Do you exercise  Daily or every other day workouts can help with depression and also with increasing appetite   Twatwaffle  cuntwaffle  asshole  Take your pick     Lots of hugs to you  I was in the same situation as you in my mid teens  I had a group of friends who were a year older then me and then also a group my age  I too found it stressful trying to balance my time between the two    The solution to the situation is to take a different perspective on it  It doesn't sound like at the moment you're choosing what group to hang with based on who you get on with better  it's more showing your face to hang out to impress the group that you're with them over your other friends  This will drive you crazy    The best thing to do is to make a conscious decision on the said day of what you want to do  Group 1 going to the football game and you don't like football but group 2 going to the theatre and you love the play that's on  Go with group 2  Say to group 1  really sorry but I've got plans  will see you guys next time    If you feel neglected by one group you could also invite them out sometime or say 'you guys up to much tonight '    Or you could encourage your neighbourhood friends to hang out with your friends from class  Bring them to the next event you go to    Be open with them that yes you do have multiple groups of friends but you value them equally  Just because you spread your time out doesn't mean you prefer one group    True friends wouldn't ditch you because you've got other mates    Best of luck   Thanks for your answer  This is what I am thinking of having as well but I don't share a lot of the stuff that other disassociative depersonalized derealized people share  It totally feels like an altered conciousness or a state where you don't have a mind or something like this   I find that the majority of people I am with  I just don't care enough about what they have to say to have a conversation   This isn't necessarily a bad thing   I find small talk to be tedious  and it's generally pretty worthless   A sad reality of our reality TV generation is that most people don't have much of  substance  to talk about anyway     I don't actually care about the answer  you know   This may reflect a certain lack of empathy with others   Depending on the extent  that  could  be a problem   That social contact you see in films is contrived and empty   When you see it play out in real life  it's just as contrived and empty     Have you tried surrounding yourself with people with a common interest   Do you find yourself being engaged by people discussing ideas that interest you   If not  maybe there's something deeper to probe   However  if you enjoy being around like minded people  then seek them out    Where is this from  No need to worry  I know what you mean but I mean how is it significantly beneficial to my situation  Spareroom co uk  Though it's possible to get your own place  it'll eat your money up  " whatever you do  don't follow the light" was said to me   I'm always up for a chat  PM me whenever you'd like   Nothing you did was wrong  You don't have to blame yourself  That guy was just a fucked up piece of shit  You encountered real evil  and you survived  You can forgive yourself because there's nothing that needs forgiving    The funny thing about repressing thoughts is that oftentimes they become much  much harder to ignore  If you can accept that it happened  just let yourself feel whatever it is your body and mind wants to feel to process it  it might help you  Your body needs to reset after such a difficult trauma  you can't ignore a broken leg  and you can't ignore depression    You could also ask your parents to set up an appointment with a therapist  You don't have to tell them why  exactly  but being able to speak openly about it with someone will do wonders for you  You wouldn't feel like you were living a double life full of secrets and lies  for one   Most commenters are telling you to improve yourself  I want to give the opposite advice  Stop improving yourself   I don't know anything about you  but I believe that you are smarter than 90  of people  Do you really think filling your head with more information will help you  Do you ever notice how people that never read books after school are able to beat you at arguments   I have to go off my own assumption  but I assume that you care too much in most situations  This is reflected in how you don't settle on a good enough word to make your point  Instead  you struggle for the perfect word  This may be one of the reasons you don't speak fluently   In my opinion  your issue will not be corrected by improving yourself  You'll get better by letting go  You've read more than enough to be good conversationalist  In a sense you were a backstabber  but you did it out of concern  He was is in a lot of pain and you abandoned the friendship when you refused to accept his apology    So what's different now  Do you plan to apologize for anything  Do you want him to apologize to you   Nobody here can tell you if he would like to hear from you  but if you're doing it out of genuine interest and concern  give it a try  If it's to stroke your own ego and tell yourself what a kind and forgiving person you are  then don't bother  I usually write down things ahead of time that i want to speak my doctors about  like a big long list of all my symptoms  It can also help you come to terms with things yourself and what you want to change   I wish you the best and if you need someone to talk to who understands  message me   I can understand that  For me  it's hard to understand her side of things  I want to make things work and I want to do whatever it takes to make it work  She claims that she tried and that she's tried harder with me than with any other guy  but she just doesn't think we can work together for reasons that don't make sense to me  It's hard to be in a position where you really want it to work  but for some reason it just doesn't seem to  Did you ever try couples counseling  I wanted to suggest it  but knowing my ex it would have been a hard sell  She isn't big on talking about her problems or dealing with them   Sell and spend your time relaxing in a forest lodge  a beach side house and a greek villa for the rest of your life  Try an app like Meetup   Find activities in your local area with people in the same age group   Build your network of people   Some that you meet will fall away and become nothing   Some will remain in the acquaintance stage  and a few may become close friends  You can't do anything legally to

much for your kindness  How are they different  And why is the scaling so low  up until 36   Well  at least you aren't ugly   I can tell you from personal experience that it gets horrible sometimes   A lot of people  myself included  are in debt after college   It only gets worse if you go for additional education after that   Basically  what I'm saying is while those things may help you get dates  they aren't the most important things for maintaining a healthy relationship   They also don't matter to some women   I personally wouldn't automatically deny guys over something as trivial as how much money they have   I want a partner not an ATM   Typically  if you have friends that are women  they will let you practice asking other women out with them or give you advice on how to go about doing that   They could also give you ideas on what some women want in sex relationships  which you could use to your advantage   I'm fully aware that it was a joke   I'm just saying that even though you long for a relationship  not all relationships are happy and fulfilling   Sometimes it is better to be alone than to be in an abusive relationship   I know what you mean to an extent   I'm a hopeless romantic  and I really want to find a guy who will just love me for me  even though I know that's impossible   Maybe you could try Reddit forever alone women to meet someone   Typically  the type of girl you say you want will not be hanging out at bars unless she works there or is the designated driver   Women who are forever alone usually try and hide that fact as best as they can since society is less favorable to forever alone women than it is to men   People feel empathy or pity for forever alone men  but that isn't the case with women   I've never really fit in either and often felt defective  but then I realized that everyone has their own defects  regardless of how perfect they may seem   I have felt angry or sad  but not really guilty or personally responsible   I just rationalize it by remembering that I didn't choose to look this way  and there is only so much I can do to attempt to look somewhat decent   So  I try and make peace with it   I don't think you sound defective  I think you unfortunately met a lot of shallow people who aren't worth your time  Thanks  Mold test kits are probably  not very effective  http   www moldreport com home mold testing kits html  in terms of the information revealed  Consumer Reports has judged them to unreliable  The best advice may be to contact a reliable professional mold tester for your best options  Do your research  Your future is looking bright  Way to go   I didn't lash out at all  I'm just not like that  She did try to contact me a day or 2 later  but I was still too angry to respond  so maybe it's my fault If you snubbed her out of anger then it's your issue  Don't pay   Your friend is doing one of two things  Either she does have a genuine issue in which case  as a friend tell her she needs help and you will be there for her but if she's unwilling to get help then you can't be liable for her anymore   The other option is she's crying wolf  Which as sick as it sounds  I met a few people that did just that because it gave them attention and others behaved in a way more favourable to them  It's hard to tell legit which type your friend is but regardless you need to distance a bit or you end up much worse off   I don't know enough to judge which one your friend is but the closer you get the more destructive things will get  Since you are a student I have no doubt you have enough shit to deal with   If she has a boyfriend she still has support there too  Is he aware she's like this   I am not too familiar with hospital bills in America since I'm from UK but surely since the ambulance wasn't for you then you shouldn't be liable  Okay  do you prefer to only talk over Reddit or do you like other forms of communication   How could someone be repulsed at the sight of you   I get not being attracted to someone  but that is extreme   What do you look like   You don't have to answer that  if you don't want to   That's just dumb to mock someone for not having friends or a significant other  especially since a lot of people don't   I wouldn't even bother with people like that   I think that sometimes you just have to breakup with friends  If the relationship is causing you an emotional strain  and it's not something that you are willing to deal with long term  then it's ok to walk away from it  I've had to breakup with friends in the past  and while it was incredibly hard  it was worth it in the long run  I actually found that by breaking up with a friend  my own emotional maturity increased  helping me to deal with similar situations further down the road    You did the right thing  It sounds like your ex friend has some issues to work on  and it sounds like you have the maturity to do what you feel  and I agree  is the right thing to do   My thoughts and prayers will be with you today  My illness hasn't been super difficult to manage for years so I have been pretty comfortable without medication  I know it's silly to think I don't need it but that was my choice  I am hopeful that my choice to see a doctor and get a referral is me hearing in the right direction for my best self  Thank you for your input but just because I chose to not medicate myself as a teenager doesn't make my choice to do so a bad one  silly and ignorant but not bad  I am hoping to find a course of treatment that is best for me  right now that includes the possibility of medication but it is ultimately up to me and my doctor  Thank you for your concern  How the fuck do you even have internet access on an airplane  Answer  probably not  yeah I know  but I regret that now  see post   and I am wondering if it's appropriate to add her back and apologize and stuff like that Thank you so much    I was most days in the summer  then it tapered off during the semester  I was in a weight training class this semester  I need to go work out again  but I've been picking up some night shifts so that's been putting a damper on my ability to work out because I've hardly been sleeping from the Zoloft tapering  It's just a nice little cycle that I need to try and break here soon    I only have a few more night shifts then I plan on even just hitting the treadmill in my apartment building's small gym    I promise that I'm not trying to make an excuse for everything  but I've noticed with weight training that my appetite decreases  and with running I hadn't been with it long enough to really be able to tell with working 12 hour shifts  5 days a week in the summer haha   Thank you for the encouragement and sub Reddit suggestion it's very much appreciated  Thank you  Quick question  How  When I get so drunk that I don't remember anything  I'm unable to properly walk  Let alone end up in a bed with someone  Hi there  Firstly I want to say how sorry I am that you have a parent like this  I do too and I know exactly what you are going through    I just wanted to say "don't panic" what you were feeling is decades of anger  hurt  disappointment and everything else  It must have been so overwhelming because you have held it in for so long    As you mentioned  you can't fix her because she doesn't want to be fixed  This is her burden to bear  not yours    The only thing you can do here is save yourself first  Is there anyway that you can move out of the house and away from her  The sooner that you are away the sooner you can start to heal yourself    After you've gotten away then get yourself some counselling  I'm not going to lie and tell you that it's easy  because it isn't  However  you can start to work through this whole thing and begin to heal yourself  You can't help your Dad or your sister while you are still broken  Remove yourself from the situation as soon as you can    Your dad is an adult and is responsible for his own decisions  You are not deserting either him or your sister  In time you will be able to provide a haven for them to escape to  You may even inspire them both to make their escape as well    Please don't medicate yourself with alcohol or drugs  pharmaceutical or other  but keep yourself clean so that you can properly heal    I truly wish you the best  Stay strong my friend Nevermind  It isn't bad but it isn't worth explaining  It's a UK thing I think  Check out before and after photos of patients who have undergone IPL BBL Photo Skin Rejuvenation  Skintyte II Skin Tightening  and other procedures at Canyon Laser and Skin Care  https   www drvanas com laser skin care gallery  Thank you congratulations on your new baby to be  I wish you all the best  a 1 year old isn't exactly a walk in the park   especially when people give you the "they are just so well behaved" out in public  Does reading fiction like Asoiaf and lord of the rings count  Or has my time reading them been for naught  If so  what kind of "reality" books am i supposed to read  Ww2 stories  Smutty novels  Or just the newspaper  Most airlines offer in flight wifi  The next time he contacts you  send him an itemized bill for the extra services you've provided so far  Then told him those are free because you're writing them off  For the new questions he's asking you  tell him it will cost "x" for the new advice  as this will be considered something that falls under your "cost per month" policy  Add that this is not negotiable  Do NOT answer another question after that until you receive a payment from him  I prefer Reddit  I am EXTREMLY ugly  spotty face with multiple scars  big nose  bogeyed eyes  deformed ears and a square head  When people do mock me I don't respond  but it still hurts  Hahaha  Not sure that would fly with my grandmother Do i have to learn all those verb  synonyms  subjective words class thingies  Is it mandatory  Plrase avoid clinging to your abuser like so many adolescents and young adults do  Get away from toxic situations and remember this cycle needs to end with her    THIS IS NOT YOUR FAULT   You fucked up by not getting a receipt  You fucked up   hardcore    Move out asap and chalk it up to a lesson learned   either pay by traceable means or get a damn receipt  Thank you so much  We are in the process of moving in with my parents right now which will make this much easier  but will come with its own stressors  I have hope to get through this with all the support I have and I am excited to start my new journey  I used to have social issues myself due to abusive parents and bullying   Whilst it may be different for you  I want to ask what is it that makes you anxious specifically  For example it could be the feeling of being worthless  the feeling you will be mocked or even just not knowing how people will respond   Finding out why you feel this way is a massive help  at least it was for me  From there it's small steps  ultimately online things are pretty good for things like this    I mean you could put almost anything here and it's not going to affect your life outside of reddit at all  That kind of freedom means you don't have to be as worried  if someone doesn't like you then that's fine  you never speak or hear from them again   If you want someone to speak to  I'm open  also thank you for that link I will offer help there too   As for your brother  he's 14  that's pretty normal  I have two brothers both younger and often the only time I hear from them is when they are in big trouble or they want something  Friendships are always great when you have a lot in common  when you're attentive to one another and when you can make each other laugh  Being attentive is the best because it makes you seem like you care for the person and they'd want to prolong your friendship  Don't be one of those people who like offending others as a joke because it can get too far and people have a right to be offended  Thank you so much for the suggestion and support   r getdisciplined   r NonZeroDay   r selfhelp Thank you  Probably best to just let it slide   Anything now will seem ham fisted and flaky on your part   That's my opinion anyway   Also  movies in theatres are usually a bad first date setting  Thank you  Thank you  A little tip from someone WAY on the other side of you   Don't ask girls out like it's a "thing "  If you like a girl  just say "Hey let's go grab a cup of coffee  or whatever       Then don't sit there with nothing to say or do    build up your game a bit  Do things in your life worthy of talking about        Don't push on girls  if it happens it happens  if not MOVE ON   Don't fall in love with every girl that bats her eyes at you   Don't worry about whether girls are friends or not   remember THEY are in the same play as you  they are thinking all the same things   Just try not to be a douchebag with them    Everything else will fall into place  Thank you  So there is no hope for people on the spectrum  I'm talking about Autism  Aspergers and sperg lords  Talk to the principal  This is beyond the pale  Thank you I'm excited to start a new journey  Find a

for years  It doesn't go away BUT  you can learn how to manage the symptoms  My quality of life has improved greatly and l am able to be a good support to those of us who have it  The plasticity of the brain allows us to build new pathways to help positively change the way we think and perceive life  I wish you the best   Isn't this anti intellectualism or however it is spelled you are referring to  Someone mentioned that earlier in this thread  Confidence exists  It's influence in success is just greatly overrated  and not just in relationships  I had a friend tell me once that there are two places every person should visit in their lifetime  one of them is Las Vegas  the other is Venice  Don't miss Vegas  it's a riot  Go with some friends  Also  I'm a New Yorker  so yeah  don't miss New York either  It's just endless things to do and see  Nobody would care  Explain to him that you have gone far beyond what was agreed upon to satisfy him  reminding him that you can no longer provide ongoing service for free  If he needs ongoing service you will be glad to set him up on a monthly plan or possibly a charge for service basis  But that you can no longer provide free support   Well  it's a start  When you finally accept this  then you can pursue other hobbies  that will at least have some hope of success and fulfillment  You're only 4 5 months in  chief  When she feels love for you  she'll tell you  regardless of who did what to her  First time I've heard of this  does anyone have a link  I am guessing you are 32  or 33 in a lucky case    You  be the initiator of an invite  Why didn't you get a receipt  YOU OWE HER NOTHING EXCEPT A VIEW OF THE BACK OF YOUR HEAD AS YOU WALK AWAY FROM THIS "FRIENDSHIP"  Really  she's toxic  Leave  research MDMA assisted therapy  very promising results   Maybe tell her that you're looking forward to taking her out for lunch dinner once she's out of hospital  I feel like there is a bit of a misunderstanding  I acknowledged I needed help  and I am getting help  I didn't feel I needed to call the hotline  it was more of a way to help myself stop and take a breather to think about what it is I really wanted to do as far as care  With my illness it's incredibly hard to slow down my brain and think rationally  my husband wanting me to call the hotline was his way of helping me confirm that I am making the right choice for myself    I am going to my appointment this afternoon  And after making this post yesterday I haven't felt anything but positive about my choice to get help  Thank you for your concern  Thank you  Even little tiny intervals can make a difference  Like try to do five  one minute intervals of elevated heart rate  stairs  jog in place  jumping jacks  etc  and you can gradually increase it    And sleep and sleep cycles as I'm sure you already know  affect mood and health so much  I bet the night shifts aren't helping anything but I know it's difficult if that's just a fact of life right now  There are various other things but they'd all be small tweaks     like try not to drink too much since it can keep your stomach full  try lower fat foods drinks since fat inhibits appetite  etc  Chewing ginger or ginger tea can help if you're actually nauseous  Thank you same to you  Internet hugs are just as comforting and I appreciate them all the same Then how does false confidence exist  One piece of advice I read once suggested only asking questions that you were truly interested in knowing the answer  I like that  because you're using a conversation with another person as a fact finding mission  You won't feel fake if you're in the conversation to improve your knowledge    I don't know if that'll help or hurt the asshole thing  but I think it does wonders with social anxiety and freezing up in a conversation   Thank you I'm so glad your mother got the help she needed and I hope all is well with her and your family   That's more deluded than the guys who say women only date 10 10 Chads  Of the two sexes  men have the wider dating range and are much more lenient in nearly every area   She's probably in most guys "would date" range  but she's definitely not what most guys would be looking for  Especially given her character on the show I know it's normal  I think she knows it's normal too but she's just like barely functioning this morning and shes practically ignoring me  I think she's almost more mad that I told her than what my son said   Maybe if my physical attractiveness went up a solid 8 points Since you only live 5 minutes away  see if there's a way you can opt out by your parents asking  Once the honeymoon period is over   it won't be cute   Yep i try to keep my foods decently low fat  I only work as needed  so I don't pick up shifts too often  I picked some up during my winter break  and I only have 4 shifts left in the next two weeks  Then I will be back on my normal schedule    The intervals thing sounds good  I'll definetly try that and work in some dumbbell stuff too   Disclaimer  I'm from Portugal    North America and Europe is a bit of an apple and oranges situation  Depends on what you want  If you opt for visiting Europe  then I'd say Portugal rather London  England or Paris  France    Personally I find both London and Paris overrated  I find both Porto and Lisbon more beautiful and they're cheaper and safer  People speak much better English than in Paris  the weather is much better than in London   They agree        Portugal  T Ls 2016 Destination of the Year   http   www travelandleisure com destination of the year This is the best advice yet  my pal found someone who caused havok and he had to get back involved 2 years later  was 18 when he set up a bussiness and he learneed if he was not thier it did not get done   Get a agency to find you a CEO someone as they have the skill set to find the right person  GO live and you can always go back in when you have had a chance to delevop in other areas  I hope you guys realize that either the smoke detector is malfunctioning or THE PLANE IS   I am really eager to hear from OP   This is gold right here  Let him know and he will be so happy as he may be worried about his snoring   OP congrats and wish you many years of happiness   Sometimes people take out their insecurities on others  which are amplified when you don't act the way they anticipate  even if that anticipated behavior is not something you'd ever do  So  yes  Also  sometimes in retail people come in looking for someone to yell at   had one guy come in on the same day every year  screaming about wanting a replacement for a  5 hose he bought 10 years earlier  which we no longer sold or stocked  The store had reimbursed him in cash in full the first time he came in to complain   He just wanted someone to yell at  Okay  then Reddit it is   I struggled with acne and have acne scars   I'm trying a new fade cream   Scars don't necessarily make you ugly   I have some   I think my one friend is absolutely gorgeous  even with her self harm scars   I'm sorry people have been so mean to you  you didn't deserve that   You have to remember that it's not your fault   There are people who will like you for your personality and be friends with you         People who are cruel are most often suffering in ways we don't understand  They deserve our empathy as well   What OP did wasn't a cruel response though  It was an expression of their own suffering  Hopefully the mother will see the suffering in her home and take steps to minimize her part in it before she creates more pain and  likely  loss in her life   We can all dream   thanks so much man Good to know  Physiotherapy is effective in treating and managing arthritis  stroke  diabetes  spinal cord injury  and even traumatic brain injury  It can offer you the tools and techniques you need not only to acquire but also maintain pain free living and independence   http   avitahealth ca team physiotherapists  I prefer Bluetooth earbuds  They don't get in the way  Yes  an iPod shuffle would be awesome for this   I second the advice of telling the cousin  Even if she doesn't believe you  perhaps her fianc will not want to come to family gatherings in the future once his slimeball ways have been revealed   It's hard not to pull away more when you are feeling disconnected but the key thing to try to remember that is sometimes difficult to get through to yourself at least I'm having a hard time with it  is that if they didn't want you to be there they wouldn't have invited you  I know part of the distance for me was created by my own actions in pushing to hard to spend time with the 1 friend I had that actually wanted to do stuff with me and I did come across as clingy I'm pretty sure  There's another disconnect with a different person there that I still have to try to figure out what is even causing it  I tried to test the waters and see if he would want to go do something with me sometime because I'd love to learn from him but not a single time showed any interest in it at all  Which is odd to me since it is a common interest for us   Something I was always told growing up was "Actions speak louder than words " Since I know what is causing that one disconnect I'm hoping to repair things by showing her with actions with is going to take months probably  So until that is fix I'm back to being alone  which sucks but meh I've gotten got at it in my years  If I can repair it knowing what caused it in the first place I just have to be mindful of not doing the same that caused the rift to begin with    Talking about it might help  but back it up with the actions to show a positive change because words don't mean anything on their own  Depending on what caused the disconnect remember that once repaired those cracks still exist and re open easier than they were created the first time so continue working on it    Yo move out and in with a friend or just find a roommate  Been caught

feeling gloomy for no particular reason may  have something to do with hormonal changes going through our bodies   Nonetheless  if you're sad talk to a friend or watch some funny youtube videos to at

my wife  I tend to make stupid jokes instead of being real with her bed  I'm no fan of the way Big Pharma operates and they need some strict regulation on how their studies and operate as ethical business that should be what is a reason to treat a little differntly than a normal non essential business is although they CEO's would whine about being interfered with by bad government that should have not ability to have any authority of any for profit corporation as they will claim that making is what is the most important aspect of what they do  and I fully support them being brought to task for showing just how out of control they have become since they were to Bribe   I'm sorry I meant lobby to have all the previous restrictions that they used be under because of just important it was to fully maintain the safety of what they sell for the benefit of the people of the USA which was put in place back when the government for most part viewed their main service was to make this country work for the people and just slowly got chipped at and is now the exact opposite    I understand the danger of these powerful opiates but I would never want those that truly will need these things to basically be able any sembelance of any quality of life to lessen chronic pain that these are really only the effective drug to do this for those that are suffering this way   I don't understand why it is now being so hard to get for people that really for them and take them properly and for real pain reduction just someone else made the choice to take for the high and just lost control  Hey that sucks for the person who got addicted from getting high on these but that is not a reason the person who truly has real need for it is now basically going back to the hell they suffered before they were able to use these drugs and it is not even  a choice that they would even consider about making the choice of trying to live without these drugs and live with the deterotion of their life from the chronic pain but at least they aren't at risk of addiction or taking them and being able to do things in their lives and not wanting to kill themselves that anyone has had a major injury has to endure serious constant pain for just a month   I hurt my back and shoulder in 2014   I had kind lasped in workout for about year and when I started back I overlooked that as I'm aged I really need to be very careful about not doing too much  warming up all the things that when I was in my 20's yeah tried to do that  but if got a little careless it never really hurt me seriously other being a little more sore than would have been had gone through proper steps preworkout   So I wake one morning and I can't raise my body up to get of bed   The pain was sharp and not just when I tried to move  it was constant and I had never experienced   I had have someone come help get of bed   So I'm hurting but felt that just to take it easy and rest and in day or two this going be going away   Two weeks later I'm a total mess   I could hardly sleep  no position was able to be in for very long because how much it hurt and it never let up  A week later I seriously was considering at least more than ever thought about ever  suicide  I couldn't imagine more day   I had no health insurance so I couldn't see a Dr   And I thought wasn't going just come out this with out medical help   So I'm sitting there just staring at my shotgun for hours as I had move often just to take my mind off just sitting hurting    And I truly that if the Teeter Hangup  commercial hadn't come on when it did or I would had the TV off  I wouldn't not be alive by morning   I watched infomercial felt that was only choice that may work I had no idea if it would do anything since know exactly what I had injured    It came three days later and it took a whole to put it all together because I was so impaired   Used immediately and I couldn't believe how 1 minute on it  after got off it  I felt a reduction in the intensity of the pain that when you have been at full blast for 3 weeks a 10  reduction in pain feels like heaven even though I would hurting bad if had been feeling this new lower level without feeling the worse level before it     My point is I got lucky   Teeter fixed my problem which showed me I had slipped a disk and had a nerve bundle pinched and also had my sciatic never injured that together was hell  4 weeks later I was almost pain  That little amount time I went through with severe chronic pain  had me wanting to apologive for every chronic pain sufferer that I kind of felt they just needed to man up and toughen up and stop a pansy and need a drug to do what I used feel could be fixed just through will power   I will never want to deny these people they strongest opiates they need to live life with a little less pain  Someones addiction shouldn't keep them from relief   One has nothing to do with other  I sometimes dwell on this too much  but those real close "true" friends are  as far as I've come to know  people you can trust to forgive you  if you humble yourself and ask for it  Maybe it'll take a few days or weeks but eventually whatever happened will strengthen your relationship   I can badmouth just about everyone  except for said friend's or mutual acquaintance's family  that is too far man don't do that  to them  act gay ish  talk about girls  science  things they know nothing about or don't care about  and the conversation will roll  Or I'll be asked told to switch topics if I don't realize sooner that I'm boring the person  or there'll be a bad segway into something we both like   There is mutual respect that allows for this awkwardness without any sort of consequence   Honestly I don't know why my best friends are best friends  They're the biggest idiots I've met  and we only have a few overlapping hobbies interests  Though over the years we've influenced each other so much that I've taken up bicycling and World Of Tanks  despite previously disliking both  I've shared my love of music and photography  and they've also absorbed some of it   I dunno man it's weird  Probably just wasting your time with this incoherent mess of a reply lol  But happy new year  I'm going to give some brutally honest advice here I guess    She's probably feeling the same way  As someone planning a wedding  there are a lot of people that you end up feeling like you have to invite  People who may or may not come  but it is nice and respectful to send an invitation to anyway    Honestly  if you feel like you never really see her or are that close  she probably isn't really expecting you to come anyway  If she sends an invitation  it's probably out of respect or a kind gesture   Edit  So don't feel guilty  It's probably not as big of a deal as you think it is  This seems a bit more aggressive than I would like but I may have to take this route   The thing I'm worried about is since the business is new  I don't want bad feedback from anyone because I've seen firsthand how it destroys businesses   He will not listen to emails from me then emails every day asking questions and changes   My business operates through PayPal and I am weary of chargebacks because I know they are really awful for allowing it  I'm going to disagree with you  Your brain is  yes  shaped by experiences  and habitual behaviors are formed  But the fun part about human neural anatomy is that the brain is maleable  New connections are made every single day between your neurons  as you learn and experience new things  Old connections can also be lost or inhibited  It is not impossible to learn to "be positive" or "go out and do something" by any means  But it's hard  It takes time  it takes a lot of effort and the will to make the change and stick with it  Mental illness makes that more difficult  I know  You aren't getting the correct levels of essential neurotransmitters traveling to necessary areas required to even try to feel motivated    But the idea that this can't be done at all  that you can't "change" the way you think is quite wrong  There would be a lot of people in the psychotherapy  neuroscience and pharmaceutical fields that would be out of jobs if you couldnt  Myself included  It takes perseverance  the right help  and patience  And that is the part that makes it all feel impossible  it isn't instantaneous and requires a lot of mental effort   Damn  I'm the exact same   This was how my mom was as well  right down to the attitude  denial  and characteristics you describe your mom as having  I'm going to give it to you straight  Your mom is not going to change  Yelling  pleading  bargaining  bribing will not change her  I've been there  I've tried  She needs to have the desire to change and from what you describe that isn't going to happen anytime soon  So you need to figure out a way to get out and save your own sanity   Alcoholism permanently messes the brain up  There are the temporary effects we all know of when a person drinks  but extended use leads to both temporary  ex  hepatic encephalopathy when the liver is unable to filter all the toxins properly and the brain is poisened  and permanent  ex  Weirnicke's encephalopathy is a permanent dementia from the brain being starved of nutrients after extended alcohol abuse  damage   The frontal lobe  cortex  and white matter of the brain become damaged and all of those characteristics we associate with people being drunk  decreased inhibitions  impulsivity  denial of problems deficits  short term memory and attention deficits  decreased safety  decreased social skills  and overall just a decreased ability in executive function and complex thinking  actually become permanent  even if the person has stopped drinking   I've seen it first hand in my patients  I'm a cognitive therapist  and looking back on it I realized my mom was the same  I wish I knew then what I do now   It's a near impossible task of trying to get a person to stop something they are physically and mentally addicted to and are in denial that it's a problem  Not only that  but even in the miraculous situation that they decide to stop  it's not likely they're going to sober up to a fully functioning person   I went low contact with my mom  only saw her a couple times a year when forced  It sucked and I caught a lot of shit for it  but I still don't regret doing it given the other options  The alcoholism killed her  and I'm glad I didn't force myself to watch the self induced train wreck that I couldn't save   Sorry for the long wall of text  In short  save yourself  Be "selfish" and get out of there  She already chose her fate  you deserve the ability to choose yours  people who use jargon like socialized dont know dick about shit in this world  the prior one  or any of the ones that may come after this So tons of people on here are suggesting meetup  And for good reason  it works    Taking a casual acquaintance to a friendship takes time  And when you don't have an activity to fill that time  it's exceptionally difficult  Having an activity takes the edge off    I really recommend Toastmasters  a meetup  a board game guild  Something where you're doing things with a group of people  It's good practice for socializing and will take the edge off    gotcha  ok so my advice might not be that relevant haha  good luck with whatever you decide  What do you mean   This is a subject that has intrigued me for a long time  so I'll offer my thoughts   First of all not only have you offered no compelling argument against the existence of confidence  but you have also  perhaps unwittingly  provided a hypothesis for how confidence is formed  First by admitting confidence comes from successful  Ergo positive  experiences  the obvious admission here is if one can affect the outcome of their experience by "Acting" confident to generate a successful experience  then he can grow in confidence over time   Aka  fake it till you make it    On a practical level  your counter argument would naturally be "I do fake confidence  and still suffer rejections"  But this is not a counter argument to forming confidence  The fact faking confidence does not guarantee success is not indicative that faking confidence can not lead to "true" confidence IF you are successful    However self confidence comes in many forms  and crosses over with such concepts as Self Efficacy and Self Esteem  For example you can be extremely confident in your programming abilities  this is more Self Efficacy   but have a very low opinion of yourself as a person  Self esteem   Naturally  you are referring to a very specific type of self confidence and conflating it with how it can influence your success with women  This isn't an argument against the existence of self confidence  it's an argument against the level of attraction self confidence arouses in a woman in spite of  or combined with additional social factors  such as looks  wealth  status  personality    Anyways  I don't want to waffle on  but I do believe that confidence is something that can grow over time  From a practical experience  I grew in confidence immensely from the age of 18 to 30  and now can safely say I am truly confident in myself  There was a lot of factors which contributed to this  but unless anyone is interested I won't bother going into depth  That's pretty much a spot on description of me   Yeah the problem lies in you  But you are not the asshole  you just don't have social intelligence  I surround myself only with cool people that i care about and they care about me  I totally agree  dude  It's like  I wrote this  Yes or they put it all over social media accounts  I just don't believe in sharing every detail of my life to the world  I started facing this problem around age 34 35 as well and greatly improved my friend situation this year  These are some strategies that worked for me   I read Daring Greatly by Brene Brown  It is not a book about socialization  but it gave me the courage to be myself and be OK with that   Instead of focusing on the making friends I changed my focus to being a friend that I would want to have  I thought about the qualities I wanted in my friends and started treating people that way  I wanted my friends to be important to me  so I started trying to be important to them  I took an interest in them  asking them questions about their favorite music  books  movies  etc  I started inviting people to do things and I tried to never let it bother me if it didn't happen right away   Never do something for someone because you think it will make you a friend  Set internal boundaries  Do only things that you are comfortable with  For example  this year I acknowledged birthdays with small gifts  I did this because I wanted to and it made me feel good doing it  It also helped to show those people that I pay attention to their lives and care  I did not do this to get birthday gifts on my birthday  If giving birthday gifts wasn't something I wanted to do  then I might feel taken advantage of when I didn't get something in return or even a thank you  This will not be fixed overnight  it can take awhile to build a foundation with people  Keep working at it and know that other people have experienced the same things and we know how you feel  Just don't give up   It'll keep your mind proactive helping keep your mind busy and positive until you've set yourself up   idk  i feel like you know where you want to live  you don't need me to answer this question  seems to me like home feels best to you because of the people and the comfort  and that's not a bad thing  also  you aren't interested in what you study at the moment   my advice  find something that you actually DO want to study  and then your schoolwork won't be such a chore  and it might actually become a part of life that you enjoy   It will get better  It might take forever  but give yourself the patience and time  Cry when you need to   break stuff if you need to  Let yourself go through the motions  And when people need you  be there for them  Maybe cry together    It will never be okay  but you will learn to cope  If you need to talk  pm me  I've had a pretty similar experience so I understand   the best advice to medical issues is to see a doctor  or in your cats case a vet   as the diagnosis can change on a case by case basis    I'm scared of letting people truly get to know me  in case they find out how much of a flawed person I really am    See  the thing is  pretty much everyone else is the same way    at best they just don't show it  Everyone is flawed  sometimes very deeply  Even people you'd never expect to be  Going out of my way to talk to people and try to get to know them better taught me that   Presenting an authentic version of yourself lets you select for the people who are flawed in the same way as you are   Note that it might take a considerable amount of time to find someone like that  people are varied  so this is just a matter of statistics  Not an indicator of how irredeemably broken you are or something   Happy birthday  hitmaker   Tell him about your feelings  if you feel like it  It's hard  but it will be hopefully worth it  I'm keeping my fingers crossed for you   r evenwithcontwxt Me neither  I'm old enough that my lack of life experience with relationships would be really unpleasant instead of even a little endearing   depends on what you want to do  did you go to college  lots of small towns have trade schools you can go to  are you looking for a career or just another job   Attractive facial features   Good genes    People like to say this like it's proven science or something  It's not  There is very little reason to believe it might be true  Facial attractiveness is just "averageness" of features and it does not correlate to "good genes"  If you really are ugly  please don't let that make you think you are any less of a person or that you are inferior in any way  It's a shitty hand to be dealt but you can still "attract" people and even the opposite sex if you can develop a fun loving and kind personality   Since you're both girls  you should be fine    However I feel it's noteworthy to mention if  you  were a  n ugly  guy doing this same thing  you'd be both "creepy" and a pervert  Contact the manufacturer  Needs more jpg   I understand that  I've had a friend whom I would do anything for without question  I have deep feelings for her and I keep dropping my words  Even if what time we spent together ment the world to me  the words "I love you " Can't seem to roll off my toung  When I can talk to her about my feelings toward her she chuckles at me like I'm joking around and I'm not  It tears me in two   But  the words "I love you " Never seem to escape my mind  It feels too difficult to tell her     I was never meant to be in a relationship  that life was made for someone else  someone normal   FYI  this is also the "just world" fallacy  just applied in reverse   The truth is  you just don't know  You might fail  you might not   That  is what you need to accept   Also  it's okay to feel worn out after lots of rejections  that's how it works  But eventually you get over it  and can decide to try again  if you want  It's best to go at it with no expectations one way or another  with the curiosity of a young child  Do things  and see what happens  If some actions lead to a better outcome some of the time  do more of that  Rinse and repeat  As shitty as it is  it might take some kind of consequences to get her to stop and get help  You must be very careful not to enter into a codependent relationship with her or a relationship where you are the parent in the situation  Also remember that her choices are hers and you aren't responsible for actions   Keep your chin up and finish strong at Uni  Update us please  You asked her out via text and she didn't respond at all  Nerves  if I had to guess  You care too much what others think of you  and that makes you anxious  Anxiety clouds the mind    Go at your own pace and say things as you intend for them to be said  If you think too much about others  you'll get distracted and lose your train of thought  The Internet  TV  and other media let you have social connection without vulnerability  It can be a great  starting place  for talking about stuff that's too tough to talk about otherwise   stuff that chokes you up and makes your head spin   But vulnerability is crucial to feeling fulfilled in real life   Brene Brown has a great TED talk on the subject  https   www ted com talks brene brown on vulnerability t 167947    Maybe the reason you don't care is because you're not having vulnerable conversation  You know  the sort of conversation where people would say you're 'keeping it real'  You're not having conversations which question or put your emotions  beliefs  expectations  and preferences on the line   Knowing how to do pleasantries is super important   your first question to someone new shouldn't be like 'Has anyone close to you died recently' or 'Do you have a purpose in your life '   but learn to navigate conversation and steer conversation in it a more vulnerable direction   If you need inspiration on how to do that  find a podcasts that does good interviews  My recommendations are ' On Being  http   www onbeing org  ' or ' Death  Sex    Money  http   www wnyc org shows deathsexmoney '   That's how you have conversations that 'matter'  Well just a week late may not necessarily mean she's pregnant I've had many instances where my gf and I didn't use any protection and she would be two weeks late  stressing me the hell out in the process  but every time she was just late  Vitamin C is known to induce a period if it's late so you could have your gf just go to the nearest pharmacy and buy over the counter vitamin c and take that as directed  That method has also worked for my gf and I   Who cares if he ignores it  Don't work with him anymore  If it was to the point of being pathological  probably gymnophobia  That might be a good idea  I know she's looking forward to being mobile again    I like the idea of bringing her cookies  I'll make something for her and bring them in    thanks This is tricky  It's pretty normal for a parent to want to shield her child from this sort of stuff  And ordinarily I would say that you should leave that stuff to the parents  However  in your case you are already aware of the information  so you are worried and have concerns  and also may not have all the information  You are also old enough to understand what is going on   Given that  and assuming you have a decent relationship with your mother  which it sounds like you do  I think it would be fine for you to reach out to her    Be prepared for her to potentially be embarrassed or defensive  or even deny it  As a parent  it's very traumatic to feel like you are letting your children down  Stay calm  let her know that you love her  and that you want to help   Good luck man  If tenant laws in the UK are anything like in the US  she can't just kick him out  She has to give him notice as if he were a regular tenant  Tell him to go back home and tell his mother he will be out in a month  That will give him time to set himself up  5 Fears for Women about Aging  http   healthdoctrin com 5 fears women aging  I'm starting to accept that I'll probably never have a boyfriend  But the word "probably" signals slight hope so I guess I haven't written it off 100  yet  Me myself  Have noticed over the years on the odd occasion a girl might have wanted to spent some time with me alone  She was torn between spending time with me or not as im not normal in fact deformed   Not enough to be classed by some as repulsive but enough to stop anyone from being seen to befriend me    In fact thinking about it  I don't think I have ever been in the company of a female alone for more than a few minuites in my life bar family of course      Take him back to the doctor  He's probably in terrible pain  I'm like your boyfriend  My wife is like you in that she's a very emotional type person  So I understand both sides to some degree  It's hard for me to express my feelings at times to my wife  I like to show my love in a different way like acting as her voice of reason in tough situations or when disagreements happen at work  I make sure to provide for her and our child the best I can as way to show she's important to me   To make sure our relationship is on the right track we regularly talk about a sort of grade for each of the 3 main aspects of the relationships  passion  friendship  and trust  I think   It's our opportunity to bring to light things we aren't getting enough of  such as words of affirmation  "you look pretty"    Of course this kinda depends on if your bf wants to improve in the relationship  If not  there may not be much you can do to at that point   Hope that helps I faked it until I made it  so I can't agree with this post in all honesty  "I'll be thinking of you  and sending positive vibes " It's hard op  Been dealing with a friend of mine whom is going through the same issues with her husband whom works with me  I get to see him on weekdays and he seems fine  The dark reality of it is he is a savere diabetic and I lost another friend of mine of the same issues years ago  So I'm dealing with going through the same dark hell two times over  I lost a set of friends whom adopted me into their family and now I'm back at it again watching it fall apart in front of my face  I'm still shaken up by it so I know your worry  If I was the kid of my friends I would have sent them to be helped even if it was against their will  It's not something that if I was busy as you I would play with or worry about  It isent fun or fair that you get to deal with this and attend uni trying to improve your life  So my advice is simply send her for help and walk away  It's extremely difficult to do  Sometimes it's just the best option  Come back to her or it whenever you can and don't let it cloud your personal success  I believe that you can do what you set your mind to do  I wish you the best of luck OP  I hope things improve from here   Well as I suffer from that condition tok the best thing is to show him support and listening to him  Dont tell him "it will be better" or "there is nothing to be sad about"  Because often depressive phases have no real reason and it makes us feel like our feelings arent important   It can be that someone with depression can be quite clingy and you should tell him if it gets too much   But by just supporting him Maybe asking him to hang out or go somewhere is nice to distract him is the best thing you can do  Tell him its never bad to seek  professional  help since you  like you said  cant relate  I wish someone told me this earlier  I'm wishing you a happy New year and hope  that it will take a turn to the better for you   You mentioned  that he knows about his issues  Not everyone can easily express himself  but it sounds you're trying to push him in the right direction  You sound like a fantastic girlfriend   Maybe see a counselor  It may sound like a stupid idea ala "that's for old people"  but it may be worth a shot    Bad feedback on a business early on can be massively damaging  I've seen this first hand   As well as that I take payments through PayPal and I know they will probably refund him for no real reason if he tried  I'm also pretty sure that's why he's claiming desktop site doesn't work   That being said  you are probably right  Wasting time on a lost cause isn't going to help anything   Right now i'm not even interested in having a relationship but want actual friends that are real and honest  I just think that itself is impossible as people are far too judgmental and ignorant  Nothing  Not even after I ran into her later that night I am so sorry  I lost my Dad at a young age too  It's been over 20 years  Look for signs from him  You'll know them when you see them  It's very comforting  I still get signs  The main one is hawks  When one is around  he's there  Every time I go to his grave  a hawk screeches  You'll know the signs but you have to watch and listen for them  If something seems weird or different  think if it's something he would do or if that would remind you of him or something you did together  Time will make things easier  You need to find a new normal  This will take time  He is still with you but in a different manner   I have the same problem  On top of my SSRIs and others  I take Adderall XR which eliminates any appetite I might have had  It's rough because you're hungry and your body  already under the dead weight of depression  is tired from not getting food  But yesterday I almost threw up after 2 bites of a club sandwich    My only advice is to eat anything you can and not be hard on yourself about whether or not it's healthy  Calories are what is important for me  not necessarily nutrition at this point   I can empathize with your problem of having ideas but unable to fluidly transfer them  Inside my mind  everything is laid out but they would come out as broken pieces instead of a whole  It also doesn't help that my social anxieties also causes me to stutter   r meirl Probably wasn't a tenant  How often for you pay rent living at your mom's place  Sit down with her and talk  Have a deep conversation and see what's going on  Also motivate her to work again and help  you need the help too  it's only fair   something i'm going to try to do this year is not talk badly about any of my friends to anyone else  sometimes i would vent about one friend to another friend  not in a catty way  just in a venting way   but I'm going to try to stop doing that  If I have a problem with a friend  I'm going to either confront them or let it go  not spread my feeling to other people   I'm on a prescription for depression  it doesn't make me into a zombie or anything like that  Keep your head up  things will always get better  You'll never find out from them unfortunately  Online dating doesn't work for people like us  And whatever you do  don't pay for it  Date  s    Beat it  normie   thanks You need to go to a trusted adult  preferably 35  simply for life experience and wisdom  and discuss this with them  This is well beyond the scope of Internet strangers    Good job OP just stay the course  They know that you're in the room right      right  It's 2017  Airplane WiFi is a thing dongleberry  if you're only looking for jobs online  try just walking into local stores and asking for jobs  If your small town has a craigslist  check on there for job offerings  Mine is full of jobs that have no previous skills required  I'm sure at least one company in your town needs unskilled labor   if you haven't already  try going to the trade school and telling them of your situation  Look for a scholarship  grant  etc   It looked like you were heading in the right direction until the last paragraph  GRATS    I forgot to mention it's his family home  His elder brother and sister both live there as well  He had a dispute argument with his mum and whilst he was away for New Years she packed his stuff in bags and left them out the house   He attempted to come back in using his keys on New Year's Day but they were double locked from the inside and couldn't get in  From what I understand he wasn't paying any rent to his mum How is opt out equal to 'mandatory'   When I went in June 2016 we didn't have it  Was with Brussels Airlines  I'm from Belgium   Ouch  I'd just accept defeat and move on   Someone just has to live somewhere to be considered a tenant  at least in the US   Tell him to check his tenant laws  It is likely very illegal for them to kick him out like that   I know that you think face to face is the right way to do this but me being a female  I know there are many different ways to express yourself   Sometimes when we get so wrapped up on the words we want to say  they come out wrong   Write the words down   Make sure it says what you want it to say  Write the letter in your own handwriting and send it to her through snail mail   She will be able to keep that letter for the rest of her life so make it good   Being in your own handwriting makes it personal   If she accepts you then you can go and be honest with her without being afraid   I would treasure a letter handwritten by my love so that I can read it over and over again   Good luck  I was right where you are for a good chunk of my life   Your family probably is uncomfortable with the topic and would rather keep it at arms length than address it with you   Try not to build resentment towards them for not understanding   I have bipolar 2 and for a good chunk of my early life my parents were the same way towards me   After my diagnosis and it was easier to manage and talk to them about my condition then it became easier to interact with them    I also dropped out of college because I don't need  a lot of money   I'm a home owner but I make enough off my "normal" job to pay the bills  I couldn't see myself spending all that time in school then working a job I wasn't happy with just to make money   I just couldn't see it happening  But unfortunately if you live in the USA  in Michigan  then you are conditioned to believe you need to go to college to succeed but that is absolutely not true    As far as finding a girl it'll happen   I had shitty relationship after shitty relationship  Stop pursuing party chicks and girls around your age   Find a chick a few years older than you that has her shit together and can accept your mental condition   Society looks down on mental illness because they don't accept it and won't realize it's a legitimate condition  But not everyone is like that   And if you believe that everyone is then you are just doing yourself a disservice    I got fired from a job after working there 5 years and telling HR about I'm bipolar  They fired me on the spot because the didn't realize mental illness is the same as physical illness   It also helps I was able to sue them and get a lot of money but still      Firing me for my mental illness is just like them firing me for being a minority  Illegal  I guess the point of the post is your better than anyone else that judges you for your mental illness and eff anyone that says otherwise   At the end of the day you will still be you regardless of what anyone else had to say or do   Keep your head up and try not to let others get to you   I completely understand it's easier said than done but after you condition yourself to know you're better than people misunderstanding you then life will get a lot easier   Reply or message if you need it  And believe me I'm just as depressed as you are  Mainly due to the toupee wearing carrot that is our president     Just trying to lighten the mood You're seeing one of the worst parts of depression  the apathy and general lack of caring that comes with it  I've been the same way to my wife  though I'm not nearly as depressive as how your husband sounds   It tears me up knowing after that I acted that way to my wife and I think your husband will too once he's out of the depressive state   Your husband is incredibly lucky to have found you and I think he would do the same for you if it were not the crippling depression   Happy birthday and know others here are thinking of you Nope  don't pay it  And ditch the friend because she's obviously a histrionic personality   If she doesn't get help  someday we'll see her kid at r raisedbynarcissists  I'm with you  Procur will do wonders  I will no longer have to participate in a competition that I have no hope of success in   The truth is  you just don't know  You might fail  you might not   That  is what you need to accept   At some point I would say around 25   one should  know    It is only through accepting that it will never happen that a male can start to enjoy life       I've been drinking since I was 16  legal drinking age  and drank 20  liqueur which is what they served at parties  legal age for that 18   Got drunk very often  haven't had problems from it so far  You should call it "my favorite cafe"  so that everyone who mentions it sounds like they love it  I wonder why drugs work for some people in social situations  Drugs practically never made me feel okay in offline group social situations  Yes  I mean I didn't even feel okay  like it felt all wrong  limited  tense and overthinking  I could count the exceptions on fingers of one hand   They did make me feel okay online and in some 1 on 1 offline situations  but I don't really need drugs for that  I assume you're religious  right  If you want to  visit your church an talk to your local priest about this  he'll understand  Many people go through this phase  were they aren't happy with their lives so they resort to drugs as an "antidepressant"  if you will       If you aren't religious or don't want to visit a church you can always do something to distract your mind from drugs  Do something fun  something that you personally enjoy  Whether it be sports  gaming or hanging out with otherpeople friends I recommend that you develop some sort of hobby  or at least do something that would help you to relax  e g  spend time with your family  listen to music  watch a movie etc   I think you should speak to her but be prepared for backlash  Parents get insecure when it comes to money really easily   My approach would be to talk to her  if she lashes out of gets angry  back away  Let her make up her own mind of how she wants to approach the situation   Even if she does get mad there's a strong chance that if you back away she will come to you later  As long as she's aware you know and your open then you have done all you can  If not  you know you can't help because she doesn't want it and that's all you can possibly do   Opt In is acceptable  If I have to go out of my way to Opt Out then you are basically saying I am a meat bag that can be used by the government for any purpose it sees fit   I tried to go to school  it didn't work  Uneven abilities is a tricky thing  The work is easy to understand  but I can't keep up with pace of life in General and complete the minimums for financial aid  and last I checked  you don't get food stamps as a student   Right now  I can manage 2 3 active  shopping  seeing a doctor  other outside activities days a week  and 1 2 household maintenance days a week  If I add more  I start failing to eat or sleep or clean the house and start overloading at inappropriate times    Within 2 weeks of minimum to get financial aid  I was so overloaded I couldn't make it to any of the meals or classes  I was doing all the work jus fine  but I couldn't go turn it in or handle dealing with the other students even to get it printed out or get food  ice  or water  Ended up trading everything I had to get a ride to a friend's    The effort just to eat enough and keep a place clean enough to be habitable and manage my most basic hygiene is a struggle requiring nearly all my effort  I've considered trying some moocs  so that eventually I could test into most of a degree over time and maybe eventually find a way finish it off  but right now it'd push my stress level to high  You have to push through the apathy that comes from your depression  Will yourself to get up and do what you have been fighting for all this time  Don't want to get up  That's the depression and not you that is talking  Go out there and make the difference youve wanted to make by being an EMT My Personal Background  I am in my 30's and was verbally and emotionally abused by my stepfather from the age of 5 until my early 20's  I suffered from chronic depression from at least age 11 until well into my mid late 20's and was in a psychiatric ward once as a suicide risk  My current relationship with my stepfather  and mother  is long distance to non existent   Knowing that about me  my opinion is this    This is 100  wrong  Your mother's words and behavior are a form of verbal and emotional abuse  The reason cause for it is unknown to me  though    You are a wonderful kid to put so much effort into maintaining a relationship and trying to remain respectful  From my personal experience  your words actions behaviors has absolutely no correlation with the way your mother is speaking to you and treating you  Meaning  you can try as much as you can to talk about it reasonably  to change your behaviors  to change your routines and personality  to adhere to everything your mother wants you to do and be  but it will never  ever make the abuse stop or even lessen  Because you are not the problem  You are not what's broken and needs to be fixed  Nothing about you is a causation for this   Very often  individuals with mental social emotional disorders and those with past experiences of being abused that are were either unable to get help or didn't realize they could be helped  will exhibit abusive behaviors  Substance abuse and addictions also tend to go hand in hand  It's a pretty terrible cycle  Reading about this may be helpful for you to not only maybe connect some dots and help you better understand your mother as just another human being  but to be aware of issues which may be arising within you and what you are at risk of   Please do some online research regarding forms of abuse to learn about what you're going through  understand how it affects you  and how you can help protect yourself  Seek counseling at school too  as you may potentially start exhibiting or already are exhibiting symptoms of depression that you aren't yet aware of for any number of reasons  chemical imbalances  strained relationship with your mother  social difficulties  past  experiences at home or at school  etc    Edit  Just noticed the very last words in your post about already experiencing depression   Always talk to someone  anyone  everyone  even your mother  about your feelings and emotions  The worst thing you can do to yourself right now is shut down emotionally  You need to find good avenues of expressing and venting your anger and frustration  rather than suppressing them  Use a blog  find supportive web forums  tweet facebook it  keep a journal  sing about it  draw  sculpt  paint  dance  play a sport  learn a martial art  go on nature hikes  take pictures  tell stories  etc    I have four kids   They all at some time or another said mean things to about me   Tell your wife to use it as a lesson that little ones pick up on our moods and whether correct or not  will internalize it and believe it is his fault   At 3 years old  there are many more years of this to come   So  suck it up  buttercup  you're just getting started  That's not very nice of her  Your country is beautiful   Brussels is fun   Your beer is top notch  Westvleteren XII doubly so    It seems however your airlines could step up their game   PS ship me some beer     I didn't know Finding Dory was on netflix  Did you just assume OP  and  their SO genders    s  Please provide some context and transparency   Who are you   What will this survey be used for  a "study" is not good enough    Etc     Glancing over your survey it seems highly unprofessional   You really need to provide more info about yourself and what this is   If you're a psych student or something akin to that and this is for a class you might mention that because that would help clear up the lack of professionalism    I've been married 37 years  It's not cute   If you sleep with someone who snores  you wake up an average of 23 times per night according to an NPR article I heard  I believe it  The airport  Zaventem  is huge and has stores everywhere  I guess the planes are lacking a bit  It depends so much on who it is  A girl that would constantly bug me to be more outgoing or one that would have no empathy or understanding for me  No thank you  I would probably feel worse and make a complete idiot out of nyself in front of her  Sadly this is probably true for like 80 90  of the women    But one that I can feel comfortable around and that I know has my back  Yes please  My friend tried to do this  He had a degree in mechanical engineering and several years of teaching English in Japan    He either needed a sponsor to give him a job in advance or marry the girl he was moving there for  meet in Japan on the same programme   Not wanting to force the relationship  I assume  he never said  and not being able to get a sponsor over there they've moved to south Korea    You don't need a degree but without one your chances are slim  You'll need specific skills and experience to get someone to hire you instead of someone from the US or with a degree  Thank you  If you mean you can't memorize the menu for when you're serving I've used this trick for years  if a customer asks a question about an item  play dumb  Say "I'm sorry I'm new here and am still learning myself  Let's find out together"  Look at the item in the menu and if the answer isn't there tell them you'll go ask the manager so that you're sure you're giving them the right answer  People will always be more patient with you if they think you're new  Plus tips will be better     Like I said I use this often and I've been at the same place for 5 years   "I know 1001 ways to kill you and get away with it " Thank you  I know  right  I mean ps2 games on hdtv are blurred especially the text in the games  So thats why im asking do need to be near in hdtv when playing ps2 games  Of course  hey its a new year  Time for some real change     Thanks for sharing your experience  I'll be asking her out the next time I see her  after break on a Tuesday  Same here  I think I do give people reasons to wanna be with me  But I'm not controversial  funny or stupid enough to make a lasting impression  Suffering does not cause cruelty  Suffering is an excuse for cruelty  Funnily enough he studied law at university  I've just told him to look it up now  Thanks for the advice  Not everyone is the same and the same goes with girls    Try to open your mind and give them all a chance  Youll find it really hard to trust someone if you think theyll just end up hurting you just because people in the past have done so  Youll find the right one eventually but youll just make it a lot harder on yourself if you keep thinking that everyone behaves the same     hope everything works out for you  It seems you have had poor mental health care oversight  Finding the most therapeutic meds is not an easy process and the aftercare  medication oversight  with labs  seem to be missing  Do you live near a university treatment hospital   These seem to offer a more comprehensive treatment modality   I would recommend you see if there is some facility program such as this which can offer a more comprehensive treatment   Unfortunately  your experience with fragmented care treatment is the norm leading to ongoing torment of those with mental health disorders  Without proper medication  aftercare  and cognitive behavior therapy you can not get better  It may be time to consider hospitalization if there is a university supported facility     I hope that you seek and find care  There is hope and you are worth care for the sake of your children   Okay cool  It's not very legal here in the USA though  Not any purpose  They can only do what the law states  You'd be used to save people's lives after yours has ended  My friend received a life saving lung transplant after years on the waiting list and pretty much accepting she'd be dead by 30  Amazing stuff   When you can come up with a better system you're more than welcome to propose it but as it stands you don't need your internal organs to look good at your funeral so if the unrelated and untimely death of one person can prolong the life of another  why shouldn't we  Thanks a lot I really appreciate the advice All you can do is control what you do  It's unfortunate that she seems to be taking something out on you   I always think the same thing while sleeping  just sleeping  with a friend of mine who doesn't know I'm in love with him  Alright I am a Canadian  legal drinking age is 19  and I am 16  Yes  I do drink  but the thing about drinking is you shouldnt force yourself into it  a lot of people I know dislike it but still drink  If you dont  enjoy it  dont do it  Drinking is not bad if you learn how to control how much you drink  and you also have to drink lots of water  First of all coming from experience  Drew is likely pursuing someone else  From what you put its probably his ex  Why would he ask her out if he was interested in you   This may seem harsh how I put this but if you pursue this further you will end up being a fuck buddy at best   Craig however is attracted to you but you aren't to him  You need to stop leading him on plain and simple if you know there's nothing there   On top of that  I have to say people do not change in the space of two months  since you put November   Saying you are not like that anymore is a downright lie  Ultimately I have no doubt if you were asked by another guy who you were somewhat attracted to you would go ahead   This is not me saying I know you personally  I do however know many people and this is a common theme among them all   If you want to keep a guy interested then stop giving them the goods right away  It lowers your own image and lowers their interest and or loyalty in the long term   As a guy I can safely say me and a few friends had this conversation before  It boiled down to this  'if your willing to send out nudes and give yourself away that easily then who says you won't do just that if it ever went anywhere with someone else '  Again I apologise if some of this seems harsh but it needed to be said   If you want to remain friends with them both then make sure they know it's just that  You need to make sure nothing happens even when drunk  If you don't care then move on and start fresh   Good on you  Just be sure to stick by your decision to kick her out  I've tried to do that before but I still end up not saying anything I want to say  I just sit there and wait for them to ask me questions  rarely do I actively bring anything serious up  I might try it again though   thank you   Cats are good too Gross  Typical SJW   Don't discuss  just label  censor and continue playing in your echo chamber   Have fun  I have   So many times Is the alarm triggering on the side of the house that the sun hits first   Are the windows metal  vinyl  or wood   If you have a loose fitting window  the sun could be warming the house and causing a window to shift enough to set the alarm off   Try to move past your previous issues  leave them in the past  Sounds like you have valuable skills  and you're working out  that's awesome  Build from where you are at  Don't let others to pressure you into getting drunk  unless you want to  and don't ruin your life by driving drunk again    I would guess your next step is to build a social circle  It doesn't have to be a social circle of popular people  seek out people who share your interests  You're still very young  you don't have crippling alimony  you're in good shape  don't doubt your self   You mentioned you have no interests  but you are interested at your work  There might be meetings for people in same career  you can try going there  You expressed interest in MMA  that's probably popular  I don't know much about it  you can maybe explore clubs catering to watching MMA  You have experience in being poor  I don't know if you're extraverted enough to maybe assist classes for people looking for jobs  We have such classes in library  Talk to a psychiatrist maybe  They might have some insight on what to do  Im talking about cultural marxism  its blatantly obvious  somehow its everywhere on this subreddit  I shouldn't have mentioned communism i was moreso just trying to drive the point home   Yes im sure you have a couple qualified members who also agree with your ideology but for each you must have a half dozen more "self identified" members attempting to give life experience advice based on some pseudo progressive oppression stack   Its not about hurt feelings  its about leading people who need legitamite help astray into an ideology that has nothing to do with it but always finds a way to creep into every nook and cranny of society today  Thats why i called it cancer   Yeah I know  its pretty pathetic  thanks for being the only semi rational person here  after 11 years  i still love the adoring snoring of my partner  and it still helps me falling asleep much easier   Someone hands you the conch  Yeah I'm somewhat introverted  and when I drink I become less shy and I have a lot more fun  A cursory search says dogs may get diarrhea from it if eaten in appreciable quantities   Maybe talk to your bf on the ride home about it   And definitely make him clean it up if the dog shits in the car   Maybe I'll try chemical castration  Just masturbate 4 plus times a day  It's funner   Only take them out during the day  because they're "the best dates under the sun"    Hur hur   Crawls under a rock  Talk to your mom  it sounds childish but mothers can help a lot  if you can't then find someone like 30  who you trust   I just got to find the right moment  and work up the courage    Cheers  Already noted all my responsibilities during my job interview  I'm basically a jac of all trades    The person that leaves will introduce me into the job aswell    Thanks    Thanks  That saying is not true  The world is full of assholes      EDIT    Okay  be good  Honest  Helpful  Want others to succeed and be happy  Have other's best interests in heart       but don't take BS from people  Sometimes you have to be an a hole to combat a world of a holes  Well the genre is hardstyle  but I don't recognize the song itself   Why do you drink so much  Consider that when you go out  you don't have to get drunk  Try not drinking so much  If you cannot moderate your drinking  if you feel you  must  get drunk or you can't stop yourself from getting drunk  then you have a problem and need to get that sorted out      It is only through accepting that it will never happen that a male can start to enjoy life   Unless you're clairvoyant  you don't know that it  will  never happen  But even accepting that it very well  might  not happen is no easy feat    By the way  from 18 28  I was certain I would  never  ever manage to get a single date  I hardly ever tried seriously  so no wonder  Been dating relatively painlessly after that  once I started taking a more honest look at reality  Don't get me wrong  I've still had some horrendous failures  but there were some small successes as well  It's definitely better than "nothing at all for the rest of eternity"   I believe you have used the word 'mandatory' when you meant to say 'default'   BA is getting bought by that German company so maybe it'll change   A short piece of unusual advice  binge watch all Seinfeld episodes all the way through  Watch the way the friends engage each other and pick up their mannerisms and try them on potential friends    Become a jokester about everything  You don't have to find it interesting  Just say the goofy response and your friends will find it amicable and love you for it   I wan't a date  but not this type of date  I definitely wouldn't recommend letting him know what you found before you contact someone else  Let your parents know if you have to  They can act as a support system   Sweetheart  I am so sorry for what you're going through right now  Remember none of this is your fault  Yea he can't help what he's attracted to but child porn is never ok  it perpetuates a cycle of abuse and honestly puts the victims in more harm because of the demand  I wish I was more useful  but I don't have any advice Why would that sever the relationship  OP states he isn't afraid that the girlfriend wouldn't like his kink  This is actually pretty common for couples to try  pretending to be strangers at a bar  not necessarily describing the sex in a cuckholding manner    It would all be monogamous  It's perfectly healthy for couples to explore links together if they're comfortable with it  So again  how are you so sure would this sever the relationship  Even if I did go out with Chad levels of confidence I am still a repulsive creature who no one would willingly approach  I hope you are just kidding about "chemical castration"   It  Depo Provera  can have devastating effects on your health   Your testicles will shrink   You will grow breasts   You may develop mental confusion   Try fleshlight instead  If he's collecting images of underage children teens naked  then it's already crossed the line into seriously illegal territory  I think you need to talk to someone you trust  and then consider talking to an authority figure if you believe that appropriate  because at this point it becomes a concern whether or not he will act on it  But really  you can't deal with this alone  Definitely get outside perspective   I got a 23  Good for you op  Have fun in college Thank you for your reply  it really means a lot to me   Absolutely  The times I've occasionally done penetration it was referred to as a strap on  I mainly give oral and grind genitals together  Because of HRT stimulation of other parts of my body like my breasts can get me off  Honestly  I would   1  Consult r legaladvice to figure out the best course of action going forward that protects you  2   Delete this post  Child pornography is serious  Being in possession of child pornography is a really big deal   I'm not trying to judge you or your life   Truly   I didn't see those photos and I don't know exactly what they hold   But upon seeing them  you are describing them as child porn  so I'm taking you at your word    Stay on the medication  It can take a few months for your moods to even out and get over side effects  If things are the same or getting worse  don't be afraid to say so to your boyfriend mother physician  It could mean a lot of tweaking of dosage and medication to find what works for you   I believe there is a strong connection between you living paycheck to paycheck  not being able to contribute equally  and feeling financially trapped and the stress of all those that may be triggering your preexisting mental health issues    If your issues are tied to anxiety and places that require a lot of social interaction with strangers  I would suggest you apply for a job in logistics warehousing where you may potentially feel more comfortable not having to deal with the customer  You will still have to socialize with people and your bosses but you will primarily be left alone to do your job for a large portion of the day  It's not one I highly recommend though because you need to know how to fight for your rights and maybe deal with some absolutely shitty people  calling HR  talking to higher ups  contacting OSHA  or departments of Fair Employment and Housing  etc    You may also consider finding a job with night shifts  or jobs in calmer settings because retail is NOT CALM  Maybe an office position in reception or customer service  Smaller retail chains  PetsMart  because honestly who ever is an absolute dick in a place that caters to puppies and kittens    What state country are you in  too  If you are passionate about art then get started right now on your education  even if its only one class  You can still work and it may help you in a lot of ways emotionally to be intellectually involved in something outside of work  Start at a community college or city college for your Associates  if in the US  and take a required class one semester and an art class the next  or one art class and requires class  Apply for FAFSA

 And take advantage of your schools fitness health services that's paid from your tuition   Pick one thing  right now  to focus on and have a long term goal  If its getting a better job  do that  If its getting more hours  do that  If it's going to school  do that  Take little steps towards the big picture and celebrate your mistakes as lessons learned  Fair enough  We all come from different backgrounds and I have quite a bit of non romantic love in my life  so that might be the reason why  I don't feel the lack of romantic love as intensely as others might  You're right  everyone has their imperfections  and in the end no one is perfect  I have spent a long time alone  11 years to be precise   over this time I have developed a bitter and cynical personality  Thank you for the kind words  I look forward to hearing more from you  That is amazing  congrats   With that kind of a score  push back on universities to give you a shit ton of scholarships  you shouldn't be paying for anything   While I agree that there are no pick up lines that will magically make women  or really  anyone  like you  I do think confidence is real  The fake it 'till you make it  did  actually work for me  so I can vouch for it    although I'd never presume that what worked for me might work for others  since we're all operating under different circumstances  It does take a lot of trial and error  and positive results are never guaranteed  so I can understand your frustration  I live in South Africa and where I stay there are zero bus routes  I'm rather a bit removed from any CBD   You need to open with  "We need to talk "  Nothing is more important right now than confronting this behavior and not letting him make excuses  Have his phone in your hands   You need to be calm and supporting  Treat this like you would a drug addiction  alcoholism  or any other form of illness  He needs help   You have to remember this doesn't change who he was to you  Most important thing you must hold on to that  This doesn't change him  He's always been who he is  He is still the same man you love but right now     He needs you   The most important part about the confrontation is that he needs to admit that this behavior is not ok  To get him to do that you need to be as non judgemental as possible but   do not   beat around the bush either   Statements like this should help     Sweetie  I love you  I am disappointed and upset  but I love you  I am here for you  Let's work on this together   The path to address this issue will need to be made by the both of you  His  willing  engagement in his treatment will be the difference between success or failure  He must come to see the error in his ways and  let's face it  we humans do not like shame and some of us will perform all sorts of mental gymnastics in order to avoid being shamed   That said you must be firm  yet supportive  The initial conversation must guide him to the conclusion of  "Thank you for supporting me  I am sorry  This is what we are going to do to get help "  Now  as for what that help is    depends on the both of you  What he needs is really going to be based on him  He may not be comfortable talking to a professional about this or he might    so offer to find the path to recovery together  Let it be a journey that brings you closer together   It's your time to be there for him  now  You can do it  Keep me apprised of how this turns out  You can always come to me for more advice   I'm sorry you went through what you did mate  My father didn't abandon me  he was just away for work most of the time  read  living with a mistress he would later marry   so I lived with my mother and she wasn't the most compassionate person as well  Her and my immediate elder sister  I have other sisters but they were cool  I feel similar to how OP is feeling and I have thought about the point you've made about being curious  But the thing is I am in High School and I find it hard to be curious  although usually I am quite curios about things  I just think the people I am in contact with always talk about the same stuff  It is either football soccer   video games or school and that is about it  maybe a couple other things like their part time job or how they are getting on with their drivers licence test but anyone you talk to  basically talks about the same old stuff as the next guy   You can pay for Doctor care out of pocket  Many will charge you less if you are "cash pay"  If you had the money to purchase an inversion table   300 to  3k  then paying for a doctor wasn't completely out of reach  And it sounds like you saw one eventually  if the problem was diagnosed as a slip disk   nerve bundle   Anyway  I'm sorry you went through that    I'm glad you didn't off yourself  but next time go to the ER or urgent care  Jeesh    Suicidal thoughts do not mean you will act on them  but you do need to take them seriously    It can be as easy as talking to your therapist  or making a written safety plan for yourself with lists of supports and activities and what to do if things progress  to as hard as walking in to a psychiatric hospital and asking for help        The main thing to remember  is that you are valued and needed  even if its hard to see through the depression    That remains true  Can't seem to find the update for some reason but good for you   You're still young and you have lots of time to improve  Thank ya for the reply   I live in Michigan  I've already applied for the FAFSA  and they wouldn't give me anything because both sets of my parents  mom and stepdad   dad and stepmom  make too much  and they aren't going to pay for my college 100   The class I took last semester was  385  and the one I'm taking this semester is  517  tuition   a  211 "fee" for it being a 4 hour class    As for the job  I feel like I shouldn't dislike the one I have now  I have grown to resent any job I have because it takes away my free time and time for things that I actually want to do  painting art   The job itself isn't terrible  except for dealing with customers all day and dealing with greedy managers   I get myself all worked up before I go in  and it makes me hate everything about being there   In the end  I just want to do something that I'm passionate about  I don't have any motivation to restock the same things I just stocked the previous day or make more drinks for rude customers  It's all routine  and the only reason I'm there is because I need the money    and I hate that    That's why I stuff socks into my husband's mouth sometimes or push him until he rolls over Open up grindr next time you're in the area and find his profile  ask him if you can buy him a coffee    I work at Starbucks and this is how most first dates go  lol  That definitely makes sense   If you're on the road to getting better then all I can really say is to just hang in there and give it time   Remember especially that bad days are just bad days and aren't representative of what your whole life will be like   Good luck  r wholesomememes trash Well  it is the first part of the house that receives the early morning light  The windows are aluminium  powder coated a dark brown  The colouring may lend to a quicker heating time but I highly doubt that the expansion is enough to set the alarm off  especially considering that I have left the windows closed for some time now  rendering any heat expansion inconsequential  I think if you're guaranteed healthcare as a benefit of citizenship  then organ donation should be the default    wish I had the type of social contact you see in films   That's high skill socializing  from both parties  You won't get there without learning from the bottom up and being able to attract the attention of such other people anyway  Thanks  dude  It means a lot to me   if you can  i'd say the best option would be to try and get him help  so that maybe he can work through these issues with professionals  going off the way you described him he seems far from a bad person  so it's very likely that this damaged sexuality comes from a much more personal and fragile place  and i wouldn't hesitate to say it's very likely that this could come from abuse that he has personally suffered in the past  if you think it would work  talk to him about it  say you're here to help and that you want the best for him  but also tell him just how it makes you feel and that you want him to go and see professionals  he may feel ashamed and embarrassed at the idea of exposing his secret to even more people but you need to tell him just what's at stake and convince him it's for the best  because it really is  another thing as well  if you do confront him about this get him to delete the pornography on his phone  he could be in very serious trouble if the authorities find out   he doesn't sound like bad guy  he's just damaged  and he needs help  not incarceration  i'm not an expert but this is the best advice i can give  Cut ALL contact with her after telling her the facts  She manipulated you with threats of suicide  She demanded to meet  She had some type of episode and claimed she was about about to die  She OK'd the ambulance to take care of HER crisis  which again she claimed was life threatening  This is 100  her doing and 100  her responsibility    You don't pay and don't engage her at all  unless SHe apologies to YOUR satisfaction    With most things in life we screw ourselves over a lot  But it sounds like you're  on the road to correction which is great yo   You handled the situation well  All things considered  You realise there's a problem  Your trying to fix it  You basically already got this on your own   So what if they view you as the girl who messes around with differant guys  you yourself said you're not like that anymore right   My philosophy with these these things is to repair or rebuild whatever fits your situ   my self respect and honor  than that's when I start to build my reputation back up  After that is when taking account of other people's opinions There probably better ways then that but its always worked for me   Other then that all I can tell you is to drop your friendship with these guys and move on a bit wiser   Hope I was of assistance and Good luck   P S  Try not to get wasted until you are considered an adult in your country  legally things can get messy  But I bet you already know that  Can I see a picture  Guy in high school had horrible shoes  They smelled like shit from 3m away and everyone laughed at him for it  It was a torture being around him  If mine smelled as bad as his  I'd burn them  It comes back to that age old question  Whether it's worth being someone you aren't just so you can be with someone who would not appreciate the real you  I've seen it happen a couple times among people I know at uni and although it 'works' it just doesn't feel right   I can be "loud " like if someone engages me when I'm out and about  snowball's chance in hell  or reciprocates if I engage with them  hahaha   I'll talk with them about anything  I mean I'm holding my hands together to keep from shaking  but I can do it    But it's a rarity that I'd be out and about  and doubly so I'd have the opportunity to talk to someone while being so   Right on man I'm happy for you and I hope it works out  Honestly  I have no sympathy for people like her  she could fuck off if I was you  She's an attention whore  I wouldn't even bother helping her  she should go and do whatever she wants  Well  I'm glad you had a good experience  but understand you are not in majority  and closed adoptions are frankly part of the problem  in all but very rare circumstances where the mother is deep in a very bad place   I am glad your situation worked out  but do understand there is a vast sea of folks who have not had such a good time as yourself  where laws and rules have prevented reunions where both wanted a reunion  And also men typically have less issues with wanted to see where they came from  Having access to one's medical  genetic  info should be a right in the least   Anyway  good luck to you  and remember your views may change as you get older  you are VERY young right now   And there are services that can help once you are ready to find out more where you came from  depending on the level of bureaucracy one must push against to get the most basic of information   What I'm saying is that you can control the flow of the conversation if you want  You can ask them about whatever you want you don't need to ask them about soccer         I get what you mean though  Since you're in high school people will talk about the same thing a lot because everyone has a job  everyone is getting their license  etc  Still  everyone's experience is different and chances are they'll have different stories to tell  Something funny that happened at work  or something crazy they saw while driving  etc       Heck  if someone who works at a certain place has a shitty manager  and they tell you about it  that's a good thing to know  in case you were thinking of working there  or if someone else you know works there when they talk to you about their job you can say "yeah I heard the manager there sucked blah blah blah" and so on and so forth       Anyways  I don't think that it's wrong to hate small talk  but if you don't want to talk about that all the time then you need to take it upon yourself to find another subject I guess  Conversation is a two way street  I think of it this way  some friends I just know I can call if I get thrown out of my apartment  Others I wouldn't even expect to help me with my shoelaces   "I'm sorry I'm new here and am still learning myself  Let's find out together"   I bet your boss will be happy if he finds out  Alcohol is not bad when it is consumed in moderation  Just make sure you know your limits and know when to stop  I tried to sign up for Obamacare but  their individual plan for me alone would cost more than my husband's employer offered family plan  We can't afford his employer offered plan and so we surely can't afford Obamacare  Our subsidy was a joke and now we are facing a  1300 penalty come April  Some of that will be offset by what they have withheld from my husband's check but  we're still looking at at least  300 to  400 out of pocket  Something else we can not afford  Thank you for your kind words   Do whatever the process is  even if it seems stupid or ineffecient  Listen and ask for help from people who have been there longer  Your first answer should always be yes if the request is coming from your boss  Coffee  Sure  I will get it  Copies  Sure  I will do that  Manual data entry  Sure  I will do that  The only talk back you get is to inform them of impacts on other projects so they can prioritize    "I need copies and these things made into a binder " "Sure thing  Just so I know  doing that is probably going to force me to push back completing that data entry you wanted  Which one is the priority " Economic contract of union  Congrats  you should have plenty of options as to college and some good merit scholarship opportunities   What are your plans  I feel you I think similarly when reading about how hateful some people are towards others  I feel that most of them are just projecting their unhappiness or maybe are just ignorant  All of your responsibilities are never covered in the job interview  Make sure you look and do what they need  even if it isn't what they immediately asked for or is in your responsibility list   Same  My HR always sends out engagement wedding announcements too  It's just another reminder that I can't get a second date  It's weird to me how popular the ACT has become in recent years   When I was in high school ages ago in TX  the ACT was virtually unheard of  more of a Midwest thing   Now it seems to be on par if not ahead of the SAT in many areas  Ugh thankfully my workplace only does that with birthdays lol  This immediately makes me think of when I make a mistake while driving and cut someone off or something  I did it on a small roundabout before   during traffic I pull out thinking she was exiting the roundabout and the lady beeps her horn  pops her head out of her window and says "WHAT THE F    ARE YOU DOING    " While I'm thinking ok that was an honest mistake  I thought she was exiting the roundabout before me but I should have waited and also that was a slight over reaction  we're going about 2mph  the roundabout is tiiiiiny  you can't go over 10mph on it without losing control  but I still thought about it for about a day and a half     While this doesn't affect my productivity when I realise I'm thinking about it too much I think 'why am I allowing this really irrelevant situation to occupy so much time in my life  she's probably forgot about it  nothing I can do now' over and over until I realise I'm right   When I'm really emotional I watch an episode of a funny show which has relatively short episodes  like 20 mins   if I'm really really emotional like crying all over the place I either watch a film which isn't sad and see how I feel afterwards or just try to sleep it off and make up for lost time tomorrow    If it's something that deeply troubling you I think you shouldn't repress it  you should have a little cry and just address it with rational words until you think 'oh yeah I've been completely irrational' I'm glad you got it together man and right now I'm working on bettering myself too  My main problem is confidence  which I hope to improve soon  Damnnn daniel he get too smash a cetacea Explain to me how giving vouchers so that vets can go other treatment centers is equal to privatization   This sub is so biased  That's true love   Well  Maybe we should take the death row philosopher's teachings with a grain of salt  considering the context  The suicide hotline can be incredibly helpful if it ever gets really dark  I had to call once recently and it did help me think more clearly  I often find when I'm in that frame of mind  I have become so overwhelmed with negative thoughts I just don't see the point and can't find any solutions other than f    all of this  Give them a call before you do anything or lean too much into those thoughts  They are incredibly nice and that was enough to help stop the cycle of thoughts  ok I see what you mean and you are right  I should be interested in other peoples experiences  I find it very very hard though I usually forget what they have told me the next time I see them   wtf  american tv shows are nuts Thank you sm it really means alot to me    Call the police Even though you've been a cock to me the last few days i'll still help you out here  My previous stepdad was an abusive alcoholic  Every couple nights or so he would get drunk and do shit i don't really feel comfortable sharing  anyways  i personally think alcohol turns you into a completely different person when abused  I think you should be fine  as it seems she may have just had a little to much to drink and got a little clumsy   EDIT  Have a happy new year man  Just sensationalist titles   And what the fuck do you care that much for  clucker  You've only supplied a little bit of information so keep that in mind but   You may have a touch off attention deficit disorder  as it looks similar to people in my life with it  including the panicky in large groups aspect  I'm not a doctor  but it's something to research to see if it describes your situation  and you can get help for  Try r ADHD  Otherwise keep trying different things until one sticks   You'll find something that grabs you and doesn't let go  It might be something unexpected  however    You were dying of alcohol poisoning and her friends thought your delusional and painful ramblings were cause for a breakup       I can only hope my girlfriend won't be angry at me when I'm dying and delusional   Mild panic sets in every time reddit goes down for maintenance and I can't see my lonely fellows  or my dank memes Lol  I just told him and he got defensive saying he doesn't snore and he was just super tired  Still cute tho  I never saw a Dr  but because of how it worked so well and since I have never felt better back wise since using the Teeter consitently since 2014   I researched what I came to conclude was the cause of  this and from my  obviously non professional opinion  none other possibilities could been fixed completley using an inversion bed and how I have not any issue since some of that is due to my now vigilant effort in following well thought out and  comprehensive  pre workout warmup that I never skip or leave anything out for time issues as I really was shown how important I have keep my ability to hike and workout and do everything I would be devastated if I ever lose the ability to do them   I admire all the people overcome setbacks and disabilites that just shows how strong they are and are suvivors who just don't anything keep them down no matter what   If I ever can't walk or be able hike with my dog or anything like that  I just know from how scared and inability to see a reason that would allow to accept that just from that little over month time and  I know it shows how weak I am in this one area that I just have to be careful do whatever I can to prevent it or I'm not going last for very long    It may be have been different had been able to keep others in my life instead just through some bad unexpected circumstances it's just me and my dog now  no one else at all I'm in contact and I've peace with that but it has made that ability to do whatever physically so I can keep my outlook at least not depressed because how I've always loved hiking with every dog I've had in nature and alone that it  still is enough for me to not be sad about isolation  Great one      Thanks   Are you close to your family  Any close friends  I know it sucks but it would probably be best to move on and keep low contact or no contact with him   I really appreciated it when a friend sent flowers to the hospital for me after my surgery  so that's another idea  It's possible it's nothing more than denial  I don't feel like the other deaths are examples of this being who you are or how you deal with death  If you've only texted and talked to ppl related to this loss and not seen the loss face to face  it could be maintaining an emotional distance  Obviously  I don't know anything but I have felt this way before and after some time  found myself wrecked  Denial and keeping a distance are excellent ways to avoid feelings   I was doing some cognitive behavior therapy through my university   I was surprised to find that I was already using all of the tactics that were presented to me in therapy  I guess I'm weird that way  I stopped going partly because they use interns who will only be with you for a semester and I didn't want to start over again and partly because I hear that if they find out you're suicidal  you get kicked out of school  If I get kicked out  there's no way I will finish  I believe that it is a result of my epilepsy which has worsened due to the demands of being a student  I plan to start trying meds that treat both over the summer  when it's okay if it doesn't go well   If there's an employee who seems to be trying to befriend you  and you notice he talks very lowly of the boss and the other employees  avoid this person like the plague no matter how convincing they sound  They are on thin ice probably and are resenting their job  don't let that person effect your job     Every job has that one person   I was in the same boat when I was your age  I'm 32 so it wasnt tooo long ago   I felt your pain  The good thing is that youre doing all the things I never did like reading up on it and watching g videos and stuff   There were a few things I realized as part of growing up   First you can not sound desperate when talking to women  You may not be but I know I had to work on it myself because the stress of not having that someone was getting to me when I was younger   Second  is that girls love confident men  Confidence isn't just about being able to talk to women  it's also about knowing yourself and what you like and dislike  It's being able to suggest a next date location with a fun activity instead of "is there anything you like to do for fun "  Finally  I understand your frustrations with texting  but remember not everyone has free time the same time you do either   It's a brand new year  join a dating site  you sound like a resourceful guy with everything he needs to make it happen this year  This depends on the laws where you live    If the law states that professionals must report owners of child porn to the police   then do not bring him to a shrink unless you want the police involved    I would take said phone   Talk to his parents  if they are mentally healthy individuals     show them the pics   End the relationship   move out  never ever look back    If his parents are not the people to deal with this and you don't want the police  involved   then you need to have this talk with him   And run    Studies have shown that these desires are hard to get rid of   At best he will be spending most of his life trying to suppress them     Post surgery  when the fragments started to pass they got caught in the tube between the kidney and the bladder  The pain was EXCRUCIATING  I woke up at 6 AM going "something is wrong  like really really really wrong " Take a DNA test and see where you can go from there  It would probably be your only hope now  wouldn't a manger get tired of you having to ask them or co workers  Here's some real advice to you  Stop drinking    holy shit  How hard is that  Clearly it happened before and you still drinking  Maybe you just like having the excuse of being drunk to act the way you act   Even if I was confident and outspoken  I still can never think of anything to say  I'm a much better listener than talker  so in groups I tend to be the quiet lurker on the edge of the group Ah  jeez  friend  That's rough  It seems like you have the right idea   maybe do a part time online college or MOOCS  I'm sorry that school wasn't the right place for you  and that it pushed you to the limit so hard  I think body shaming is when someone else makes you feel ashamed of your body  not when you personally are ashamed of you body because you don't like they way it looks  thats more self conscious  Like lets say as you said someone avoids going swimming  they don't feel comfortable because what they think of their body  any person in the same vicinity of them could think that they looked completely fine and not as bad as that person thinks they looked  idk I'm drunk though so probably not wording it right and probably don't listen to me lol 1 Do you mean girls with fake body parts   If yes  the problem here is not the snapchat account  it is that you VIOLATED his intimacy    You get it  If you felt necessary to snoop his Reddit account secretly  then there is a problem in your relationship in the first place  Have you ever thought of that  On top of everything  you also found something that could mean your husband's sex life is not that good  Again  another relationship problem    Communicate more with your husband  see what he needs  Maybe he needs a good fuck and you haven't given it to him lately    What do you think   Is she in a state with Medicaid  Free therapy while she has no low income  yes  what else do you think marriage is and always was  The show is fake  The problem is that sooner or later I slip and act kindly or confess humanity or don't tell her to eff off when she acts nasty   I'm also not the best at acting manly because of my stupid hormones  and often realize only later how I was supposed to act to make her horny   Luckily I sleep like a log   So I don't often hear mine   but when I'm trying to get over to sleep  it's not good heh   Been with mine for 20 years  Don't believe the comment below about it being snapchat's fault  Just got the phone and the camera is way bad  But I came from a Note 5 that has a 16mp rear camera and the front cameras are supposed to be the same  but the quality is not   Please do  I'm more than happy to help you get through this if I can  This is just a general information point for readers of the sub   I genuinely wasn't familiar with the term  I'm guessing I'm not the only one      According to this "RationalWiki"    "cultural marxism" is a term popularized by Nazis    referring to an alleged conspiracy to topple Western culture  http   rationalwiki org wiki Cultural Marxism  The Nazis' definition of "legitimate help" includedmurdering about 70 000 disabled people  among other things  https   www ushmm org research research in collections search the collections bibliography people with disabilities Oh  here's another thing I forgot to mention   She isn't a citizen    I'm not clear on her status as a legal resident  I suspect she has either a student visa  green card  or nothing at all  True but I'm referring to the audience  which is real  They were gasping when she said she's an 18 year old virgin Ew  that's a deal breaker for me   I'd break up with him for sure and he'd have a hard time trying to convince me to not call the police  Yes  I agree with you 100   She'll very seriously say "you don't love me   " if I haven't told her within a couple of hours  She lost trust in people as a whole  see my previous post on relationships for a crazy story  when her family did something to hurt her   Yeah that snoring isn't so cute when you a few years in and sleep deprived because your SO has sleep apnea and doesn't take care of it  then you also have that newborn that wakes every 2 fucking hours  But don't let me shit on anyone's happiness  Yes  focus on looking past the surgery and into the future  plan things in  The this surgery won't feel like it might be the end of the world  but something that's necessary and then she'll be back on her feet  figuratively   I mean your actual shoe  If they're all dirty and worn out just throw them away  Sounds like a lesson in 'caring people take suicidal threats seriously'  Even faking suicidal threats is dangerous behavior because someone who does that is very unbalanced and unpredictable  Real or fake  you did the only thing anyone can do   get her secure and safe  A licensed therapist would've had to call emergency  And therapists don't get billed by the hospital  Unfortunately our healthcare system is expensive  but you didn't create that system  You don't owe her for taking her seriously     Don't take on this debt  explain you will always take her threats seriously and call authorities to keep her safe    It was 5 years into our relationship before my now wife told me i snored  I was like  no way do l  I'd snored since we met   You should contact the police  he always has the option of getting a social worker  and a therapy team to help rehabilitate him  However  he has crossed certain lines that can't be undone  If you care about him  you'll contact the police in the interest of protecting those kids he's looking at  Legally you aren't really going to be on the hook for anything  you didn't seek out the photos and happened upon them by chance  You not saying anything however  that's what puts you in hot water  I'm sorry OP  but keeping quiet on this isn't an option  Everyone eventually gets caught  and the last thing you want is to get involved when it gets messy  He has more options if he just turns himself in  but I don't know what kind of guy he is  There is help out there  but right now a phone call to the police is more important than anything  Have you been to a counselor or sought therapy  You have all the symptoms I had in school  being moody and depressive  having a general pessimistic and cynical outlook on life  It was hard as fuck going through adolescence with that outlook  What helped me was medication and changing my perspective on life  I learned to find things that interested me  found hobbies and outlets for my energy   It wasn't all good though  I still struggled with confidence issues all the way through college  I always expected to be asked to be included  I know now I lost out on a lot of opportunities because I didn't try to actively engage with others  If others don't see you the way you want to be seen  make them see you by seeking them out yourself   Finally  it's hard not to get discouraged when shit doesn't work the way you expect  This is where your hard work ethic will come in handy  You just have to stick with it   It's 2017  you have a whole year and lifetime ahead to do great things I'm skinny  always been skinny  no girl aside from a couple of crazy   broken ones found me attractive No problem   Stay strong and make it a good year  It is one of thousands of interchangable songs  Just find one that is similar and call it good  There is zero special about it   I get almost 0 matches despite making a fake profile of a hot chad  and there are barely any active female users  italy is still in the 1800s Haha yeah I get what you mean but I don't think that anyone expects you to remember everything you tell them       Anyways  I was just trying to share what works for me  but everyone's different you just have to figure out what works for you  I'm definitely not an expert or anything I'm just trying to help or at least show a different perspective       When it comes to social interactions long as you're happy and the people you talk to are happy then you've won as far as I'm concerned    Thank you for posting to  r helpmecope  While you wait for users to post and help you  please take a look at  the Wiki page  http   www reddit com r helpmecope wiki index  that contains many different coping techniques and strategies    Thank you  again    r helpmecope team   I am a bot  and this action was performed automatically  Please  contact the moderators of this subreddit   message compose  to  r helpmecope  if you have any questions or concerns   i thinking about dying but necessarily not killing myself  With mental health its easy to look at it as two things  the chemical imbalance and the state of mind  Let the state of mind overcome the chemical imbalance and then atleast it will be some what tolerable  think of the people who love you even if it doesn't seem that way  If you can think of the people who are there around you and still want to die at the same time then i say professional help is needed  but who am i to give someone mental health advice without a licence  just off experience  Apparently this guy was having multiple surgeries to fix his heart but he still found the strength to fight the normies  Guy's life was on the line but he was still fighting  The REEE is strong in him   I know I'm just a stupid Redditor but you stole my heart  Can you describe what you mean by office cliques and why to stay out of it in the workforce  Asking because I feel my workplace is very cliquey and I don't like it but am trying to learn how to deal with it I'm not sure why you  should  logically have any rights to your body when you cease to exist as a person  It's just emotion that made that the norm   I have no idea how the UK works so a lot of this could be very wrong but  It sounds like you guys have some sort of social security there such as https   www gov uk jobseekers allowance  where you get money while searching for jobs for example  You could probably get your friend to talk to either these people or some sort of charity  we have stuff like st vincent de paul and salvation army and stuff   Tell them he has been kicked out and has nothing to his name and nowhere to go  in where I live they're usually helpful if its for emergency relief situation   Hopefully one of them will place him with some sort of social worker and hopefully temporary shelter that can help get him on track with his new circumstances  Ideally the assistance from the UK should give him enough to become self dependent in rent and obtain a job to keep himself going   I'm assuming money is the problem here mostly because otherwise he could just start renting a very cheap crummy place for say 6 months until he can get back on his feet  Though I may have missed the point of the question  It's kinda weird  but it's not pervy or anything   I sold my soul to Cthulu for comfort  He ended up giving me tentacles and now I am an established Japanese pornstar    Follow your dreams   You're fine  Everyone I know  including my parents  have done it  As long as you're comfortable and it doesn't seep into other aspects of your life  like affecting your grades or your ability to function  you're good man  This is an issue that is beyond your control  You can seek advice from your family or your friends but that is not going to resolve the problem here  You are still young and although you love him  you still have a chance at having a healthy relationship with someone who is not going to put your relationship in danger  or any children you may have in the future  Your boyfriend needs to seek the professional help of a psychologist or therapist and hope that by revealing this information that he doesn't wind up with criminal charges and jail time    I advise you get out before you become an accessory  Do not forget you are fully aware that your boyfriend has illegal pornographic images of children in his possession  You can also be held responsible for not reporting this  I also wanted to add  back years ago when I dated a guy who was a drug addict I used the same excuse as you are using here "But he has helped me through all of my issues and stayed by my side  How could I leave him when he needs me " You know what  Thats bullshit  Your boyfriend has helped you with issues that commonly need help while his issues are super illegal and just awful since children are involved  Think about that   Had this problem a couple months ago  Pull an all nighter then go to sleep the next day around 9 or 10 pm  Ask something  and when it's your turn to reply  comment on something they've said  Then ask another question  Never keep the ball on your court  If it works out  suddenly you're having a full on conversation   even with a stranger    Sometimes despite your best efforts though  the conversation dies or feels one sided  There's not much you can do about that  One thing I learned was  when asking a question  it's good to be prepared with an answer you already have on what you think the solution may be  It shows you put thought into it  but of course don't ramble on if the situation calls for short questions Are you friends and would you like to keep in touch  Sorry to hear that  he sounds disgusting    If you wanted to out this guy then I would suggest you need to try and get him to admit to what he did so you have some evidence  However clearly in order to pull something off where you can get some evidence would require you to be very careful so he didn't realise what was going on    The obvious things would be to secretly record him on a call or maybe secretly film him  Or maybe just get him to admit what happened over text  could you contact him on WhatsApp and discuss what happened with him and so have text evidence   I appreciate this may raise other issues particularly if it went wrong but depending on who you felt about 'outing him' then it could be an option  Me  Whooooh    WAIT    oh     Ahhhh  This is what I needed  Really  thank you so much  I'm probably going to go back every now and then to read this            A lot of what I'm saying more so relates to the real world  but if you can start applying it now you will be so much better off in the long run            You probably already stated this somewhere but I just wanna make sure  How do you start now What do you do now to make yourself better in the long run         School doesn't give you very much freedom because your forced to do the same things everyday  This is very un natural to some people like yourself  but it was these thoughts  memories and experiences that were amplified and directed once i got out of school          This makes a lot of sense  I'm now in high school and the first week or so I felt so good about myself and so confident  it was almost like the feeling I had two weeks ago  It was because of the amount of freedom I had in the high school compared to the junior high  at least I think so          Yeah  I'm already known in my school throughout some groups  I'm active in the school plays in such  and get leads   but I guess that's not really the problem  schools cool  except for the work  but when it comes to teachers and adults  then man  you got meee  It's also the fact that I suck at making conversation   but only with adults  I feel like it doesn't make any sense for people my age to ask about their life  that's just weird  They should ask about  my  life  lol  not conceited       And ha  my generation is a little bit screwed up  About a quarter of the really annoying "cool jocks" are actually genuises  They somehow know their stuff when it comes to school and act like it takes nothing   What about  "The cafe on       enter street name here"   Ie  The Cafe on Main The Cafe on 5th   r stopdrinking Oh  and babies too  After reading the top comments I have to say there seems to be some odd advice here     Regardless of your feelings towards him and what he means to you  you HAVE to report this to the police  Failure to report this will make you an accomplice  and you could be in legal trouble depending on your local laws  Even if that wasn't the case you should still report it  Child porn is not a victimless crime  Those girls in those photos are being severely abused  The police may be able to trace those photos to the source and help those kids  Furthermore  do you want to be with someone that's like that  What are you going to do if you get pregnant  What if you have a daughter and he assaults her sexually  What if your friend  sister  brother  etc  has kids and he's left alone with them  What about when he is caught  Because they always get caught  Do you want the fallout from his crime affecting you  What if he harms a girl and you could have stopped it    I'd suggest going to your local police station and filing a report  Call your parents friends etc  and have a place to stay ready  The police may have you bring them the phone or allow you to search the house  They may ask you not to leave right away so as not to alert her  Try to cooperate but remember your own safety first and foremost  It's always better to pack up the essentials when he is work and leave  if your planning to leave      Your other option  which isn't that great  is to confront him on the topic and see if he is willing to get help  But I know if I was in a similar situation I couldn't trust that      Visitation rights in hospitals  a commitment to stay together  Your mother sounds very selfish and may be emotionally abusive  You wanting to know your genetic history should have nothing to do with her personal emotions about an individual   Anyway  my only thought is perhaps the hospital you were born at has records of who was listed as your genetic father  I'm honestly not sure if they keep those kinds of records around  but it might be worth a phone call   It's also possible that your mother's ex husband knows your father's name  if you can  respectfully  get in contact with him to ask  Well it was deleted from Personal finance  We are friends and will keep in touch  but not really often by house visits since even as neighbors we didn't frequent each others homes too much  just usually send across some food  gifts  etc  If I were you I would speak to my parents and let them advise me of how to go about this  They may tell you to lock it away or they may speak to your cousins parents to come up with the best possible solution  as they are going to want to protect their daughter from marrying a creep   Don't just forget it if you care about your husband  No because confidence   ugliness   creepiness All males  suffering from erectile dysfunction may improve their sexual capabilities by taking Filitra 20 40 60mg medication  Generic Vardenafil is the main ingredient of Filitra    Inventing a time machine would be a nice first move   s You're still in school so I guess you already talk to girls from your classroom  Talking to people  not just girls  randomly is indeed weird unless there's something in common to talk about  I would say talk to the girls you're in class with more  That could lead to you getting to know other girls sometimes  Also what do you assume will get easier as you get older  I'm going to add that you definitely need to seek out an authority figure  Child pornography is not a victimless crime   It's up to you then  If they are friends  and you want to  let them know your new address  Probably will mean Christmas cards   If you don't want to then don't  There is no social rule with neighbors  It's more if they are a friend or not  Cats don't do that unless there is a problem  My perfectly normal and active kitty started doing that one day  He would have push out a long and low meow if I petted him  He was vomiting and he wasn't responding to me  Well after a day of this I rushed him to the ER vet  They found nothing on the X ray and I was stunned  My cat's eyes were wet and red around the eye  He was still not himself  I rushed him to another vet the next day since he started to deteriorate  Turns out he had thread tangled in his intestines and caused a blockage  It ran from his tongue to his intestines  He needed immediate surgery and fortunately survived  Now I know what to look out for  If your cat is acting out of the norm then get him checked because something is wrong  I don't know  that sounds like a way to get teased about being suicidal  These folks sound like real assholes  I would honestly just calmly leave a situation like that  I don't know or I don't care  We have an I Don't Care Bar and Grill near by my house  The name is great but the foods kinda meh  ideally 10 or so years younger tbh Today there is easy divorce  so it's not much of a committment  Depending on the country marriage was about paying to buy the woman  or getting paid to take the burden of mantaining the woman off the family  You'll need to take it to a lawyer  get three quotes for repair and three for replacement of the vehicle and use the cheapest to form the basis of your civil suit   I am more suicidal than have ever been but this neurodoversity round up made me feel like I mattered again   There are people out there doing research who want to help me   I love scientists and hate general practice doctors   I'm a woman  Autistc  have ADHD  and have heard voices in my lifetime   Thank you  Id go either way in age   beggars cant be choosers First  you need to let yourself grieve  Cry  Take hot bubble baths  Read trashy magazines  Eat chocolate and ice cream  Allow yourself to be sad    Secondly  remember that it's ok and normal to miss them but not want them back in your life    It's going to get harder before it gets easier but you will get over him  You will get through this  You will move on  You will be ok   I had a friend in highschool who said she wouldn't want to be an organ donor because she wanted to have an open casket funeral  We were fourteen  she must have heard this absurd idea from adults in her life  Misinformed adults who don't understand the things they are talking about  Can you tell me any actual drawbacks  I hate to break it to you but there's nothing inherently special about your corpse  You  are  just a meat bag  that's real  Wouldn't mind   10 years older  Please point to me where in international law it says that you retain the basic human right to your body after you die  I feel the same way  I don't even know what I want anymore  I've sat down multiple times and just tried to think "what would make me happy " Haven't come up with an answer yet    They can only do what the law states    So any purpose the government sees fit  In group talk you will rarely hear any pauses  I'm a guy so this might be gender specific  but when I have something to say I sort of breathe in and lean forward to give everyone a non verbal clue that it's my turn to speak now  Sounds super weird when I describe this  but usually works  if the audience is not too drunk anyway  I did  don't tell certain subs on Reddit or ill be compared to hitler   s Alright  I will look out for that    Thanks  That's a good one    Definetely gonna try that  That is her responsibility  If she was in her right mind then she would have calmed down and came out to talk to you  Having a panic attack does not warrant for immature behavior  I've had panic attacks before and all I want is for someone to comfort me and calm me down  If she didn't want the ambulance to show up she should have come out and asked to leave the restaurant  You were worried about her health and wellbeing  not knowing what she would do since she threatened suicide   Had she taken it further and hurt herself then you would have felt guilty  Refuse to pay the bill  She shouldn't have even asked  I hate to say it but she sounds like someone who has a classic case of wanting attention  That's so sad  inb4   Yeah me and my girlfriend really hate those threads    there's nothing inherently special about your corpse  Sure there is   It's MY corpse   What is done with it should be MY decision   There are plenty of religious or personal beliefs that may not align with what the government has made default     A healthy body and healthy mind is very important to live a healthy and graceful life  by use of some health and wellness practices you make your life healthy and enjoy every second of it  To live a good and happy life we should eat a healthy diet with daily routine of doing exercise  Best way to start your day is with breakfast that is not only healthy but rich in protein  You need to provide your body some fuel  if you do not have time to make breakfast then eat some fruits and drink milk  Eating healthy is one of the main key to living a long and happy life  We all are very busy these days and sometime we dont have time to prepare healthy meal then we use fast food which is not good for our health  I would agree that suffering does not necessarily cause cruelty  but I believe it often does   It's not enough to dismiss a person for being cruel   We should ask ourselves why they're cruel  while  of course  protecting ourselves from the cruelty in the meantime   I'm pretty sure they have cue cards  Imagine if I told them 32 ish  They would drop dead  18 year old female virgin     18 year old male virgin You absolutely need to master swimming in a pool before attempting this in an ocean  Pools are controlled environments  There's a very minor current at most and it won't pull you away like a rip tide or a strong current in an ocean  Pool water is cleaner and easier to see  helping you become comfortable opening your eyes in the water  which is ultra important  I'm a swim instructor and my recommendation would be to slowly progress through swimming in a pool  When you can go the full length of the pool twice without stopping  besides to turn around of course  then you're a safe enough swimmer to go in an ocean and be able to get out  If you need to  look into learning from a swim teacher or a friend who knows how to swim well  Good luck   What about the school's mental health facilities  Yes  I was thinking "you and millions of other humans   " Yeah  I honestly don't get the talk of chemical castration we get here  People talk about it as if it will remove any desire for a girlfriend  but all it will do is remove your desire for sex  you'll still be lonely  I'll have to agree  my initial statement was too broad  I know I've done some pretty mean things as a result of past trauma  However  in OP's case  "I  abusive thing  because you  something innocent or integral to your identity " is textbook abuse excuse   Going back up to OP  I hope your situation improves  I hope that your mother realizes what she's been doing to you and makes a change  or she stays out of your life until she's able to get better  You don't deserve this kind of treatment    Not at all  but like with most things social skills related  it entirely depends how you do it and what the intent behind your actions and energy is saying    In other words  if you are starting conversations by just being friendly and casual  maybe by making observations  asking genuine questions about school interests etc   with the intent of just getting to know them  you'll be successful in making friends and won't come off as creepy  again  provided you are being genuine    No  I mean transgendered    The sub the post came from is one for people who have male genitals but identify as or otherwise appear female  and for those who appreciate them     There are many reasons he might have saved the post  and yes  of course his interest in it  and my inclination to snoop are both indications of relationship issues   I didn't think it was necessary to acknowledge that in my post     My request was for advice on how to talk to him about it   I'm not angry or presuming anything at all   I'm just worried and confused and looking for any useful guidance on approaching this sensitive issue    i think some of it is dopamine issues  constantly stressed and no positive reinforcement  brain not going to release any for motivation  there is porn but then after fapping one is left even worse off because there is no drive lol  why it's hard some days to get into anime and gaming    REEE  Oh okay thanks  Yeah I just didn't know if it was a social rule Maybe talk to him first and give him warning and a chance to get rid of it before completely ruining his life  His life will be over once he is turned into the police  If he helped OP through difficult times  even through meth addiction  it would be cold and IMO wrong to just turn him into to jail right now  effectively destroying his life with  such a record  As fucked up as CP is  he is still a person  and if you care about this person  you have to give him a chance and at least talk to him about it first   To OP  I urge you to sit down and have a talk about what you found with your boyfriend  Talk about how illegal it is  what the consequences are and tell him he needs to get rid of it now and get help  Find any resources you can for people like him in the area  show him to a therapist  etc    and then  you should seriously consider ending the relationship  As much as you love him  it is probably best to leave him  he has his own demons he needs to work out and you deserve to be happy  It would be very emotionally draining and difficult for you to stay  You not calling the police and talking to him about getting help should be your last act of love before moving on  Good luck  Now go out there and show the world what a badass you are  Every now and again  a post shows up on here that's just beautiful to read    Good on you  OP  Hope you have better luck in love going forward  Removed  this is better suited for  r relationships I guess Tinder over there must be very different to how it is in the UK  Though it's a woman's game anywhere  I've seen some old female friends use it  and any guy they swipe right on  they get a match   Go back to therapy   You are a perfect candidate for therapy  please get help  If you find a therapist that isn't helping you  try a new therapist  Repeat until one works  Don't give up  Fight for your right to be well   I am so sorry your life has not been kind to you  No one should have to feel this way  but we have to deal with the consequences anyway    See if you can get back on meds     If not  you'll want to give your body and mind the best chance it can to fight depression and that is in keeping yourself healthy in all other ways  Nutrition  exercise  sleep  socializing  productivity  Meditation is always good too   One thing to know  depression brain doesn't know what's good for it and must be ignored and we must act in the opposite way  It will say " hanging out with people sounds terrible" but if we go out and have fun we will actually feel better  Depression is the disease where you just have to do the things that feel impossible to do  no biggie   sarcasm  You already know wrestling helps keep it at bay  GOOD   Don't stop   Exercise is crucial in staving off depression and you've got that covered   Lactic acid directly impacts the part of your brain your depression messes with  motivation     Eat nutritious food  Learn what makes your mood feel better by watching how categories of food make your feel  carbohydrates  proteins  fats  and fiber  High sugar diets are known for making depression really bad  Indeed  if I eat junk food too much for too long my mood is destroyed  I fix it by eating something with tons of veggies  spices  and ingredients in general  Pay attention and you'll see the connection   Socialize  make sure to have good times with friends regularly  Even good interactions with strangers can make one feel connected    Sleep good  don't miss a good nights sleep or your brain will be too much of a mess to keep itself together   Productivity  by getting things done we feel empowered  and depression is a disease of powerlessness  So if you get depressed and don't want to do anything  like chores or whatever  accomplishing them will actually feel good   When in dire straits to feel better  actually  help someone else   Kind acts out of the blue  or working for an important cause  By focusing on someone else's well being and happiness we don't feel our own distress  but we do feel empowered     Meditation is a healing balm for the mind  Look up mindfulness meditation techniques  Meditation will help you focus your mind on the thoughts you want  not the bad ones   Like a muscle  you get better at it over time with practice   If you get all of these under control  your brain will be the most healthy it can be  and you can more easily tackle life's challenges to make your life REALLY great  Any other mental issues beyond that are what medication and therapy are for    I hope you can start a life for yourself out on your own  Hang in there and don't give up  if you dont' give up success is inevitable eventually     I used to think that was my problem  Ended up getting in shape and making friends  It made it a lot easier    Then I found out my problem wasnt confidence and that I never go out   I'm not much a fan of small talk either  When I get to talking with people  it's either brief spouts of what I muster up  or it's balls deep conversation  this is how it was described to me  that will either make people very uncomfortable or make them feel a deeper connection with me in some way  That is the thing about conversation though  You should say what you mean and mean what you say  Small talk is poison to real conversing  What is the issue here  Depends  If the person is giving you small talk to try to work into a true conversation  you will see it  and that's great  Don't be afraid to be open up as long as you're not sharing secrets  If they're just making small talk because they are fearful of being caught alone  you don't have to meet to some standard of conversation  Just be kind with whatever you're saying  They'll either understand or they won't  It is not your fault that you aren't a fan of meaningless conversation  My main strategy is making something meaningful out of the meaningless  Whether they're open or not  I would have gotten my point across  If they are though  well  it seems you're in for a good talk  I hope this makes sense  I tend to rant and externalize things at times  but I am just trying to help explain them  I suppose if you wanted to start something meaningful in meaningless small talk  speak what's in your heart  not in your mind  That's what really matter to you  Even if it is veiled by a mind trying to make sense of it  With love   EDIT  To add to this  I know you're looking for specific advice on the matter of children conversation  but you shouldn't feel ashamed for not having them  even if it isn't relatable  You don't need to explain yourself on the matter  but it may give you an opportunity to share a bit about why you chose not to have kids and how it has affected your life  for better and for worse  People are more drawn to a unique scenario than one that seems like a carbon copy of all the rest  Just share your heart         Thank you for the information  I hadn't considered the long term effects of alcohol addiction  but it makes sense  considering how long she has been been drinking  Best wishes to you  Honestly  you terrified everyone  Her friends are probably freaking out  and I think yours would do the same if you and your gfs roles were reversed  I mean someone who she lives and who cherishes her acted awful towards her  even though it wasn't really you   I think that you should give her a day or two to breathe it off  no contact and then maybe ask her if you could treat her to a fancier dinner or something cute  She obviously still loves and cares for you since she took care of you  she's just shook up right now  As are you  Who wouldn't be  Be sure to thank her for taking care of you  wait a bit and do something cute for her or buy her her favorite candy and bring it to her  As a girl I think that would really help   I think it'll work out  just do something to show her you love her and let her breathe  You fucked up  you survived  thank god  and she took care of you  You two aren't the first to go through this  many other couples have survived things like this   Also that sounds so incredibly scary  I'm glad nothing worse happened   She wasn't angry at him during  just after  That's different   With any substances  you'll most likely regret doing them at a young age  Haha  that's fucking hilarious  Good shit  I'm sure that there are a good amount of men still using tinder here  but almost no women  and those who do still are not there for hookup  Sorry doesn't replace trust  Remember you did look into her texts without her permission  That isn't how love  respect and trust work  Maybe she'll change for a month or three  but that lingering trust issue will plague you  I really hope you all the best   I'm sorry that that has happened to you   Deep breath and small steps moving forward  Wish you the best  OP  Youre young   Weight can be lost  I know people in highschool that could be labeled as "weird" or "losers" that went on to date many people others are now married   17 is too young to conclude that youre fa     Dont listen to what your family says   Actually dont listen to what mostly anyone says   People are fucking stupid   Just look at the world we live in   People that can throw a ball pretty well you can make signicantly more money than engineers and doctors  Thank you  that makes me feel somewhat better  I really don't know what to make of it all  over at  r relationships I was told  rightfully so  by everyone that I'm an idiot and am lucky she's still with me so some kind words are nice to read haha  This  I could never deal with snoring omg I'm so sensitive  but all the more power to ya  Luckily my bf doesn't snore except when he's sick  and then we are both miserable  Ask them about what they like to do  I can talk for hours about the shit I do and I'll be into the whole time too  I'll be shouting about it  I think its the opposite just on new years eve there was a post that was crawling with normies handing out there "advice" I even got into an argument with another normie about how mental illness isn't like a form of thinking  Most of them come and just talk about how much sex they've had and how easy it was and how you should be able to do it only to get mad at you if you don't follow it   especially sucks in your 20's  hah  you think it's difficult now  but at least you still have youth on your side  Give it a decade    And jesus h christ I don't even want to think about the poor saps in their 40s and 50s and beyond    Don't forget to shower before the first date  Honestly I don't care what happens to her so long as she is removed from our lives  I've tried so many times to help her  I'm not even sure an intervention would help  Maybe with professional help  maybe  I dont think youre bitter i think its just people trying to boost their own ego   Or maybe im just bitter too This seems to be the consensus  It's the advice my granddad gave me  Thank you  Congratulations   Why would they want to help people here in the first place  To have more competition  LOL  made my day     It's just one of those social signalling things  like "I was driving in my BMW" when the story doesn't involve the car at all  Most probably don't even realize they're doing it  there's just a subconscious drive to mention shit you think is impressive to other people so they'll like you  Wat is dis What is your differentiating factor    Why would people go to your caf instead of somewhere else    Location  Food quality  Service  Good place for people to work    You can use that as a basis for your name  I guess it depends on what travelling factors are most important to you  If managing your costs within a tight budget is a top factor here  I would recommend the Canadian national Parks  I see from your post history that you're Canadian so I'm sure you know that our national parks are free to enter this year due to it being our 150th bday  Since camping and hiking are relatively low cost anyway  and since you'll save on admissions  I can definitely see you being able to finagle all of the Canadian cities on your list in to the same trip  depending on how much time you have     Also  the federal government and most provincial governments will be pouring a whole pile of money in to event programming year round all over the country  This means New and enhanced festivals  shows  activities and other public events in cities and small communities all year long  Some major cities  such as Ottawa  are dropping big dough on this stuff as well  For that reason  this year will prove to be an exciting one everywhere you go so you could choose to arrange your travel plans to hit some of these as well  Come summertime 150 events will be hard to avoid    All of your European cities are absolutely worth seeing  Reddit is weirdly negative about Paris but I've been there loads of times  both for the touristy stuff and to just hang out and drink wine and eat delicious food  People there have never been anything but polite to me and I'm an English speaking Canadian  so don't let anyone tell you that you'll hate it   go see for yourself  Plus  France is such a beautiful country in general  so I recommend taking the train out to some other areas if you can swing it    Personally  I don't see the point in going to the US this year with so much great stuff happening in Canada for 2017  You can always save them for next year      Talking to people  not just girls  randomly is indeed weird unless there's something in common to talk about   Not if you do it right  Should've taken the photo with the shower tiles in the background for the ultimate meta game  Yeah that is really rough  I can't blame her for not trusting anyone anymore  even if you haven't done anything wrong being betrayed by your own sister is a real low  I'm so sorry mate  the only thing I can suggest is to just support her  and try and get her to see professional help because you can't help her with her problems  but someone with an education in it may be able to help  I wish you all the luck mate You're welcome  and like I said  you can message me whenever you want  Aw  that's sad that people were so horrible to you for so long over something that isn't your fault  It's perfectly understandable that you would become bitter and cynical after that  I think you could combat that  if you surround yourself with nice people  You do not seem bitter beyond repair  You were nice to me and didn't tell me to get lost or anything like that   I'm more stable now  My sister spoke with me on the phone this morning and told me she was my best friend  but couldn't find me  so I have to go back home and see her today  My mother hasn't spoken to my dad in two days  so hopefully it'll stay that way  This takes time   Barely a year and you are not better yet is no surprise  Mental health improvements are rarely fast  You are not wrong or bad or messed up because you are not better yet  you are completely normal   See if you can get in to an endocrinologist to check for hyperthyroidism  One of the side effects I get from it is excessive rumination   nonstop thinking about people who made me mad  Weird huh   But it turned off the minute I got on some meds  Other symptoms  irritability  anxiety  head sweating  hair thining   I also hope you can find a therapist who can help you work through your traumas  Medication is good but it needs to be taken with therapy so you can learn new ways of thinking that aren't harmful   I encourage you to try out meditation  as that is the skill of learning to control your focus of your thoughts  Any meditative practice will help you stop thinking about the bad thoughts if you don't want to  Look up mindfulness meditation  Buddhist teachings in general are great methods for finding relief in new ways of thinking    Please be kind to yourself and know if things aren't working right with therapy or meds or any care you're getting you can ask to try something else and they must respect you  You will have to be the one to advocate for your own care and make yourself better  even if you weren't the one to make you sick  We all in the same boat    but we can help each other    I am going to correct you with one comment here  Just because her husband has a specific fetish or is into a different type of "thing" it doesn't necessarily mean their sex life is suffering  Sometimes people just get bored with the norm and start to explore their curiosity  Maybe it is something she should talk about to him  ALSO  to OP you should not be sifting through your husbands personal things   Yeah I know the feeling you have  Honestly if you find the conversation drying up  I like to think of abstract and big picture questions that provoke the other person to think  One tip I heard is asking follow up questions using "what" and "why" to really expand and deepen the conversation as it continues  Also you'll find yourself more engaged and hopefully your friend will too as they answer a question they may not have thought of before  Personally  I like asking questions like "What do you think about    In the future " Or something like that where there is no one word answer and probably will open up possibilities for the conversation to grow into   Hope that helps   When I see goodlooking people I start to get very angry  Then maybe he saved it just for fun  to show it to you or some friend for example  Best case scenario   Have you considered that   If not  I don't know  too sensitive for me  That's all that goes through my head  This is a good explanation of things  She often cites my dad and I "abusing her" as a cause of her cruelty towards us  She considers our attempts to stop her drinking  not doing exactly what she wants  when she wants  and trying to get her to listen when we tell her how to change and how to fix herself "abuse " Oh correct  I just assumed the other party would ask questions too  even if it's the same question   It also helps to use a few emojis or exclamation points to show a little emotion   I actually prefer younger guys  I think most girls like older guys because they want someone to take care of them  I don't need that  I just want someone to have fun with  How old are you OP  Good that would benefit society Do you really go to the circus freakshow to help the performers   If you're near a University  you could call yourself "The Library"   It doesn't  necessarily  mean anything   Not uncommon for good  straight males who aren't going to be anything but  to have transgender masturbation fantasies   But to actually go beyond  Unlikely   I wouldn't talk to him about it  Frankly  you shouldn't have snooped and again  it doesn't necessarily mean anything   Keep it as a data point and file it for future reference   That's it     If you can't do that  I would say that this is more of an issue to your relationship than concerns about his sexuality  and apparently you know that  So  good luck truly  There are too few examples of when an protective type boots somebody out of their life  but my message essentially is  If they do not value you and grow "secure" in always having somebody to catch them no mater what bs they do or get into  then they need to grow up more  meaning horrible things must happen so they learn that integrity is not just a vanity item but survival   Your story broke my heart  I get it  I so       get it  Going through almost the same thing right now  I don't know what's worse the cheating or the mind games that cheaters play  15 years down the tube  He said she's good to him  What he means is she kisses his butt and does everything he wants    Please remember this  the other woman hasn't put up with his good  bad  and ugly  He hasn't shown his true side to her yet  I now believe once a cheater always a cheater  In my case it's also once an alcoholic always an alcoholic and a cheater and a manipulative jerk  We are better off without people that drain our good energy   I dont feel like reddit can help you to be honest  This is too deep  This is too serious  You need to talk to an adult about it    While looking for a house I did see some lots but they're about as expensive as what I'm qualified for     Unless you're clairvoyant  you don't know that it  will  never happen  But even accepting that it very well  might  not happen is no easy feat   Clairvoyance is not needed  just an understanding of the universal concepts that make one desirable  There is a reason why  in my 34 years of existence  no matter what I try    nobody   has wanted anything to do with me  My family hasn't wanted anything to do with me  I have never had a girlfriend  or even a male friend     By the way  from 18 28  I was certain I would  never  ever manage to get a single date  I hardly ever tried seriously  so no wonder   Well   I   tried hard  Many people on here try tried hard     And that's the  only  reason that they included the opt out option  It's not their fault if someone forgets to opt out  especially since it'll likely be done when applying for either licensing or some other government required registration  If you feel like really doing it  or need a caring soul  call a hotline  Don't even question it  just call  If you can't call  get out among people even if it means wandering the aisles at the only Walmart open all night or sitting in a booth at the Awful Waffle at 2 a m    This sounds like suicidal ideation  rather than feeling actively suicidal  I went through many  many years of this feeling  I didn't want to kill myself  but suicide  death  and dying were very frequent  prominent thoughts  I'd also wondered  what it would be like to do random hurtful things  like put my hand under a running lawn mower or drive into a median   Do not do these things   Sometimes I'd indulge the thoughts  other times I'd be scared that I felt this way and just knew I was crazy  feared I really could do something terrible on impulse one day    lots of anxiety and what ifs  After getting trauma therapy and medication that worked properly for depression and anxiety  I realized I wasn't crazy  just not well and needed the right help  and had my own work to do   If you're able  please start seeing a counselor and be totally honest and open about everything  If cost is a deterrent  ask about counselors who do pro bono or sliding scale work  If that doesn't pan out  start sitting in at support groups for depression  anxiety  grief  OCD  trauma   anything that seems like a reasonable place to start   I strongly recommend this anyway   Tons of churches offer support groups if you can't find one that's close and not spiritual  Don't be put off by the religious aspect right off the bat if you're not into religion  because a lot that I've attended aren't pushy and  as with everything  you can take what works and leave the rest  If there's been substance trouble or abuse in your life or a close relationship  other good support resources to look at are Alanon and AA    I'm throwing a lot out here  but I'm thinking of addressing the reasons why you feel suicidal and off  That's the root cause you'll have to untangle and heal when you're ready  That's how it worked for me     How well trained are your legs  Well that post had around 4000 upvotes and probably made it to the top of r all  so there were a few of them there   It might be the reason why there are so few of them here  There are a lot of posts here  but most of them never get more than 100 200 upvotes  unlike some other subs  And by hitting the front page more often  the subs become more famous and attract new people   I pay everything I buy with a credit card  I then pay the credit card off every month  It's a great way to build credit  If you aren't doing that I highly suggest it  Having a proven track record for using credit is huge  You may be at the brink  They've always been doing it  You're just now noticing  In a bit of time you'll actually start to spit as you watch couples walk by  Hey  I am also a sexual assault victim and I have self harming suicidal tendencies  I am so sorry about what happened to you  but it's okay to feel how you're feeling  Don't feel like you have to pretend to be someone you're not right now  and don't be afraid to open up to someone  Your friends  your family  the police  just anyone  You can get help  Therapy helps a lot  being able to talk to a trusted adult confidentially and getting real advice can be extremely helpful  It will get better  believe me  It might not be worth much just coming from a random Internet stranger  but I care about you and I hope you are okay  I know how terrible it is and I know about feeling worthless  depressed and alone  Don't be afraid to PM me if you need someone to talk to  or I can give you my email address  You are a wonderful person  you are stronger than you think and you do not deserve the pain and suffering that you are dealing with  I really hope that things get better for you and I'm here if you need me  Sending love  keep being brave xoxo I'm a software engineer coder and I actually go to coffee shops a lot to work  I enjoy the bustling atmosphere with lots of people  it makes me more productive  I also enjoy people watching while I'm thinking about how to solve problems  Also  people may not always just start talking to you but if you initiate conversation and are friendly  most people will be happy to talk  People like interaction naturally  and love talking about themselves if you give them the chance  Hell  I befriended a girl in a coffee shop and talked with her for like an hour after she tried to sit at a broken wobbly table after I'd seen like 3 other people try and I made a lame joke about it  Have you talked to your therapist about this    They can address it directly  as developing trust is part of their toolset they learn  and not having trust is a symptom of many disorders  and a very common problem they help people fix   Dude just print this out and give this to your therapist  You cannot get through therapy if you can't be open about your feelings so you have to deal with this problem FIRST  And therapists EXPECT to   The weight gain from these things is from a change in appetite  not anything magical    If you're concerned  you can weigh and measure food while you get used to the new medication     Just ask your GP how many calories you should eat daily to maintain a stable weight  and do that for a while     Think of it as driving your stomach on manual mode for a while   You can also exercise some to increase that number a little  by about 600 kcal per hour of sustained cardio     manually find a balance    and your weight should be more or less stable over the long term   edit  bolded important part   WHATEVER the ssri does to your carbohydrate metabolism  you can figure it out and compensate for it one way or another     This is very hard work  but it is doable     There is no fault involved  but you are not powerless to fight it either  You might be living in a high demand place then  If you're set on a house and living where you do  you might want to look at places in the suburbs or just outside of the city  You know  sacrifice the commute to get a place of your own  The thing is    he's harassing for non sexual photos that hes gonna jack off to  He's done this to two of my friends and they feel disgustes but didn't think they could do anything about it  Hello I'm 25 They know the answer  They are either hoping you have a valid reason  like busy with work  school  or just trying to make conversation  They come here from time to time  but not to help   They come here with a post along the lines of "I just broke up with my bf gf of five years   I'm FA now "  r relationship advice is a much more productive sub   Sorry bud  It's too late I think you have a point there  If I may ask  when you said you want someone to have fun with  did you mean as in something casual  Cause I've gotten the experience some older women will consider younger men for that but not for anything serious  How much younger do you go for  I have this thing where I have to be the older party  I don't know where it comes from or why I have it  I'mean never interested in older women  Age is a deal breaker for me   I see  anything in particular you find attractive with younger people  so inspiring tbh D'you think it's worth posting there too then  to get another outlook on it  I try not to limit myself too much   My range is 18 to 45   The closer to 18  the better   I'm 39  I said "it could mean"  I did not say that their sex life is going down for sure  I said it could be because of that   Don t drink any thing except water  and not much of that    One of my voice students made the error of drinking milk before a interview  and she sounded like a 10 year old kid  Makes your lips and tongue stick together    Breath  but don t make it sound like a tornado going into your throat  If you get to pre read the material  use a pencil to put in pause points and underline the power words   Jim b   Talk to somebody you trust and or report him to the police  I hadn't considered a physical letter  That's actually an excellent idea  I'll write one up and see how it looks  Thank you very much  By a few years or do you feel you have to be a lot older than her  Another thing that helped me was just getting enough sleep   I have a low dose of ambien for that   So the nights I can't calm down take it and its just enough to get me to sleep   I know it can get scary at times just know you aren't alone in it   I've heard this before  I once vacationed near an ocean  and I was too scared to get too far out because the waves were crashing and I had no idea how I'd get back to shore  I really want to try floating in the ocean one day  Beans         we have  have a few    JiM b   You can just give her support  beyond that you can't do much else  She needs to get some courage and if she really wants to break up with him  just do it and be stern in her decision  Make sure after she does it  that you're available so she can come see you and you can comfort her   Thanks for the input  It may be a regional issue  because in my country  when you turn 18  either party can open the adoption and get in connection with their parent pretty easily  If the parent reaches out  the child has the option to accept or decline  But I've never heard of anyone not able to get in contact  My aunt put a teenage pregnancy child up for adoption and was easily able to get in contact 18 years later despite the child having moved across the country  For specifically these reasons there is opt out  I hope assholes like you go to the bottom of the organ list  You don't want to give your organs when you die  then you don't get to receive other peoples organs You body is not yours it's made of what you eat and what your mother ate when you where an infant  So in way you are only renting it  Yes    At first I thought they were going "oh"  because it's not a big deal  since it's actually fucking normal  but then a few moments later "I brought X to take my virginity" and they started clapping     I will never get Clapistan and how they push this meme  If a hamplanet like her gets looked down upon  imagine someone that's normalish looking and how they'll react     It looks fake  but that's how memes get started IANAD but as I understand it seems some psycho active medicines like mirtazapine can increase appetite and therefore weight  It works just like "normal" weight gain    you won't gain 20 pounds over night  it's a gradual process    One thing you might consider if you do decide to try mirtazapine is weighing yourself now and then in 2 4 weeks or right before your next appointment  If you do gain weight  keeping in mind that a person's weight can fluctuate up to 4 5 pounds in a single day from water alone   definitely talk to your doctor    Best of luck  Thanks for your input  When you say to float and curl for warmth   what do you mean by curling  Honest question   I feel like I'm going through a similar thing too  I've accepted that my job is my job  I'm not sure about everyone else but I don't know if I'd enjoy work any more than I do now if I were doing something more creative  I've just tried to pursue other interests despite not loving my job    When you say you want to do something more creative do you just mean music  How about art  I just got into Dungeons and Dragons  and that led me into miniature painting  So far I like it but I do fear it might be short lived like you've said in your post  I think it's best to just do what you can and continue to discover new stuff until you find something you'll keep at for a while  There's nothing wrong with trying and not being able to stick to it  You really have to start somewhere  right   Let her know that she doesn't owe anyone a relationship and that she doesn't need to win some sort of court case to break up with someone  She doesn't need his consent  She just has to do it  Tell her to do it in a public place if that would make her feel better  Let her know you will go with her if she needs you to do that  Suggest that she completely cut him off from all social media as soon as she has broken up with him  You can go into the sea until the water reaches your waist level for example and you are able to return safely  No big deal  Even a kid could do it   Unless the weather is very very bad  But if it is so  you will know it  You shall try it  the feeling of getting hit by a wave can't really be described by me     I think that for the most part  posters here want sympathy  not assistance   It's not like a normie has the ability to cast a love spell on your behalf    You can be friends when there's no longer a "him sized" hole left in your life   That is  when you've moved on and made a life without him    whether that means you've got another man  or not   The thing about long time couples  like married couples  is that they do become something of a group mind  one handles some things for the pair  the other handles other things   Nobody has to be good at everything  because the group mind itself handles that    and that includes not only skills  but things like the ability to ground each other  calm each other down  provide confidence  etc    Edit  And when one leaves or dies  the other is confused or bereft  because half of their "mind" has vanished  and they have to make up for it    Every couple starts in the group mind direction  but most of them don't make it  especially if both aren't committed to the same things   He had one vision of what your relationship should be  you had another  and you both liked each other enough that you stayed together even though you couldn't reach agreement   But without agreement these things will either come to a head  or you'll just drift apart   And frankly I think coming to a head is better than just letting the relationship rot away passively    Forgive him for not being what you wanted to think he was    he isn't     and not understanding why he ought to be   Forgive yourself for not going over in his direction    because maybe you shouldn't have  how much of yourself are you really supposed to give up   It will hurt  and you will move on  and it will take time   I don't think you should be friends because that would be confusing to your emotions   His willingness to bring up the "friend" thing so early is just a sign of him not being on the same page as you when it comes to what this relationship meant    This is definitely good advice as well  Tell her to follow this   Thank you for the tip  It's my goal to be able to swim a pool's length twice  It frustrates me that even children learn to swim in a more  seemingly  faster and fearless manner than me  I wish my parents knew how to swim or at least enrolled me in lessons  At this point  IRL I don't make my inability to swim public   so I'll probably have to find another swim teacher  Too much shame  Great  About what is that  generally  She got a new boi   she doesn't give a fuck about you  Just get away  Just sharing my opinion  you have a problem with that  If so  you may want to leave reddit   I love my mom  But she is a bitch  I want to go as far s to buy a car tracker and see if she's really going to work   To be honest  if after four years  you're not ready to commit to your relationship  it's probably not a relationship  You have to decide to either take the risk and move there  if she can't move to you  or you probably should end the relationship  Most people in long distance relationships don't want to be long distance but it sounds like you have no issue with that  which isn't the best sign    It's about compromise  Move there for a bit and see how it goes and perhaps after she's finished her education  see if you can move somewhere more suitable   Honestly  I think you're best bet is listening to  u basicczechgirl  You messed up  it happens to everyone  Make sure it doesn't happen again by not drinking so much  eating a meal before drinking  and staying hydrated with water  Then do something to make up for it  Make sure you straight up apologize as well  I don't think you have a lasting relationship   Modern tech lets you live apart and still relate to each other    while keeping the important life decisions on the back burner     But you can't keep them there forever  if neither of you is willing to compromise their life preferences  you have to break it off or at least dial it down to non exclusive   The best thing to do would to leave it up to your parents to sort it out  Maybe there is a reason why your dad is thinking and reacting the way he is  a reason you might not know of  You could also talk to your dad privately and explain to him that you disagree with his actions and that he should talk to your mom about the matter instead of fighting and making the situation worse  Hearing it from you might make him realise that the way he is going about this is influencing you in a negative way  making you stressed and worried  Good luck and I hope this flies by   What sort of things could I do to make up for it  I've bought a card that I'll send to her  but they say that gifts aren't a good idea  Should I treat her to a meal or something  She usually never lets me pay for anything haha Hey  I'm sorry about your friend  He sounds pretty stupid I have no doubt saying that he will get a rude awakening one day  when he has to fend for himself and live in the real world  If you don't think he's a good friend to you  just stop being friends with him  because you can't be happy in a toxic friendship  You sound like a pretty cool guy and you should have other friends  Just spend time with the people that you really like  and don't waste time on spoilt  unappreciative people  Luckily  not everyone here in the UK is like that  PM me if you need someone to vent to    While I'm not usually a fan of white knighting I'm going to urge you to to speak up and especially make the men in your family aware   Guys        tend to pick up on other guys acting creepy  faster than  girls do      What this guy did was calculated and brazen   This guy knowingly placed you into a he said she said   You need to assume that he is doing it to other girls in your family    How will your family feel if he's outed by  someone else and you were silent        Instead of being afraid use your family for courage  your sincerity will shine through   But above all live your life for yourself   Anyone that chooses that scum over you isn't worth worrying over  Thank you very much       The weight gain from these things is from a change in appetite  WE DON'T KNOW WHY SOME SSRIs CAUSE WEIGHT GAIN  YOU ARE WRONG   For example  weight gain from anti depressants might be because of changed carbohydrate metabolic pathways  https   www ncbi nlm nih gov pubmed 23855649  Or changes in the gut microbiome   here's an easy read Quora answer  https   www quora com How do SSRIs affect the microbiome  You've just told people who have little control over the weight gain  and who have  mental ill health  that their failings are entirely their own fault  I have no idea what happens  I hate routine work and And I despise doing the same thing over and over again  I need constant change or stimulation to be interested or else I just don't care  Maybe because I think its a really easy project to do if I were to truly put the effort in and then I just half ass it all the way  No matter how insane of a task it is or how interesting it is I WILL LOOSE INTEREST  It just gets boring af  I have tried everything  I feel like this is holding me back from finding my true passion  Mind  Blown    maybe literally  someday  No problem   If you don t mind       what sort of training have you had in the past     And what type of work are you trying to get    Jim B   Credit karma says I'm at 765  It's high demand all over really  I'm in northern California where prices are pretty much high everywhere I think I got through high school by being likeable by older adults  and proving I knew the material perfectly  not so much by going to class  Towards the end  I couldn't even manage half the homework with all that was going on at home   I imagine that finding a job I did well enough to be profitable compared to other potential employees would be nigh unto impossible  Things I do well generally still take me longer than most  and interacting with others always eventually results in a problem  My non written communication skills are as uneven as everything else  too good at vocabulary but I can't keep pace and use facial expressions  tone  or body language  Eventually  either I think someone's angry or mean or someone thinks I'm rude not paying attention etc   I'm just not worth it in terms of profitability  even with more education  I was trying the MOOCS last year  but then I had to find new places to stay like 6 times  and I'm still unsure if this place will last long enough to move my stuff in or get internet  Even so  there isn't much chance of me ever being able to handle too much more  It only takes a car alarm going off or similar sudden loudish noise to render me nearly useless for a day  and while our medical understanding of sensory differences is still very new  so far it seems sensory issues generally need to be addressed in very young children for any benefit and tend to worsen with age  Stop drinking and going out  Find another form of entertainment  alcohol isn't the only fun thing in life you know  You're right  it's not my problem anymore  It's been hard to separate myself from it since  for a long time after we split  I was still the only person who knew the full extent and thus was the person she talked to about it  But that doesn't happen anymore and you're right  Maybe it wouldn't be a bad idea to develop some quiet hobbies to ingrain some sort of peace  Well   split family  fights and change of school doesn't help you to get better  Even that can make you feel worst   Everyone and especially people with mental health issues need stability   Anyway   try to go back to therapy and try to make at least one  most trusted person in the family   know how you honestly feel about everything     About your situation pretdending   well it's heavy to say  maybe you just miss social life  your friends from old school and brothers   maybe is just usual day dreaming   maybe something else    professional therapist should know better    but still   that fact that you've been diagnosed with so many different diagnoses shows that even professionals can be wrong   Hope you get well   I don't know the ins and outs of your relationship  so it's easy for me to say this from a 3rd person point of view  From an outside point of view  3 years together is not some ungodly amount of time  It is a lot of time when you're 21  but it's not a huge amount of time in the grand scheme of things  Don't think of it like you "wasted" these years with him  You learned a lot about yourself  what you value in a partner and relationship  and what you will and will not put up with  Maybe you would be willing to put up with this and try to get him the help he needs  My personal view though is that somewhere along the line he got severely damaged  Maybe he had a rough upbringing  had a traumatic event  or something that triggered him to have a lust for such a horrible fetish   Some people withhold judgement  Some say that if he's not actively out there feasting on children then it's harmless to let him indulge in his desires so long as he doesn't actually do anything to kids  Not me  I can put up with a lot and consider myself to be more patient than just about everyone else I've met  But this is not something I would tolerate for a second   You're 21  You don't need someone with this kind of baggage in your life  Yeah  you could talk to him and he could explain himself  Maybe he says it's just a fantasy and nothing he would ever act on   Maybe he admits that it's wrong and he wants help but is scared to seek it out  But in that case  is that something you want to deal with  As you said  you can't even look at him without wanting to throw up  Maybe he even addresses it  Maybe he sees a therapist  works through his issues  and all is better  But then 20 years down the road when you're married and have a couple of kids together and a house out in the suburbs  all of a sudden he gets arrested for molesting a child  Or he goes back to downloading images off the internet and gets caught   The most difficult thing about this is that there is no certain path forward  You can certainly talk to him about it and hear his side out  Even if he gets help and gets "over" this  you're going to consistently wonder if he's still attracted to kids or if he would act on anything there  And God forbid if he actually DOES do anything more than just look at pictures   It's hard to throw 3 years away like that  If you were married to the guy for 10  years  I might give you some different advice about hearing him out and trying to work through it  But you've only invested 3 years into this guy  I know that truly is a lot of time  but in the grand scheme of things you have lots of time to get over him  move on  and find someone else while you're still young  It does make it difficult that he helped you while you battled depression and meth addiction  Some would say  how is his addiction any different than what he helped you with  But in spite of that  there are resources out there and there are clear pathways to help for those addictions  Meth and depression are two types of addictions with a very strong physical component to them that can be overcome  The child porn fetish is something rooted mentally within him that is not something you can easily treat by going cold turkey or taking some Prozac   You're only 21  You're still drafting in the first round right now when it comes to available people  You can meet an attractive  intelligent  good hearted guy still and have a long and happy life  By all means  talk to him first and see what he has to say for himself  Ultimately it's your choice if you want to stand by him and try to get him some help  but from an outside point of view I would strongly recommend breaking away from this guy  So your partner is clearly mentally ill  but in my eyes as long as he hasn't actually abused any children  he isn't unrecoverable  This might  and I guess probably will  put an end to your relationship  but I believe putting him in prison will turn him from a pedophile into a child molestor  which is what prison does  makes things worse   What this guy needs is professional help to control his illness' urges and overcome the clear problems he has  You should definitely touch base with an older adult that isn't going to act based on emotions  but logic  An emotional response to this is going to end badly  because that's what emotional reactions result it  bad decisions that feel right but make little logical sense  If he refuses help multiple times  you should push him multiple times to get help and threaten legal action if he refuses  then the only solution is legal action  However  I must stress that it is in a way  your responsibility to ensure he has the opportunity to get professional help and make sure this doesn't lead to anything more  although it is NOT your responsibility to make sure he takes said opportunity   If you need any clarifications or if I was unclear in my comment  please PM me and I'll help you the best I can  I'm no expert  but I do want to help both you and your partner and make sure there are no victims in this situation  Not really  that can help you but most of the time it is weird  I suppose I could rid myself of the bitterness  but it would take a while  I mean I've seen normies on here with faux "I want to help" lines  but really it's obvious they're trying to trigger people  There are too many complications within the story to summarize into one sentence  You shouldn't be giving people advice if you aren't willing to read a "long ass

without any contact  it's natural to be concerned as to someone's welfare   If I had regular contact with a friend and then didn't hear from them at all for 2  weeks  it would be natural to be

much time chasing someone that you may have been in talks with and never gave you a real shot  Happens  just move on without being dramatic   that's a limiting belief  people are much more receptive

do not cease  maybe ask a doctor about it      Instead of focusing on the making friends I changed my focus to being a friend that I would want to have  I thought about the qualities I wanted in my friends and started treating people that way  I wanted my friends to be important to me  so I started trying to be important to them   I love this observation  How was your growing upp  Controlling

keep your promise  that you're not drinking again     I know that if I was her  and you had even one drink  I'd be dreading the possibility that this might happen again  I think this single incident was so severe and upsetting that it alone justifies cutting out alcohol altogether    Maybe in the future  way in the future  you could revisit social drinking again with her  but at least for now you should not touch a drop   Hi  first please accept my apology for my late response  It seems to be a somewhat chronic issue of mine  All I can say is that I have been knee deep in family drama for too long    I think that is a fantastic idea  I generally prefer the "DYI sink or swim on your own merits" method as it seems to suit me more  I'll look into the ted talks  Thank you  If your friend has any interest in allowing a complete stranger to pick her brain about the whole process  please let me know  Haha   Thanks for your advice  Ok  that's just ridiculous  Tennis elbow I can empathize with but selfies   p Dealing with Envy is dealing with reality  You might not be where you want to be in life  or you might feel like you deserve what they have more than them  The reality is that's probably true  you might  You can either be bitter and let that emotion rule you or you can accept it for better or for worse  The best thing you can do is work to make sure what you have is something you can be proud of  What you're saying may not be wrong  These people have it better than me  these people don't have to go through as much shit as me  I want friends like them  It's normal to want more  and it's normal to pout about it  Just don't linger on it and let it define how your life is run  Be jealous  be mad  just make sure that being jealous and mad makes you work to something you want versus defeating the purpose of trying to get what you want    Sorry if this advice wasn't that great  I just thought something was better that nothing  Best of luck out there   I've never heard of toastmasters  I am looking into it now  Thank you so much   P S  I'm so sorry for responding late  I have had a lot of family drama and lack of internet connection    Want my honest opinion  He's not producing  distributing  or physically taking action to "further his needs" he's only viewing non nude pre teens  which actually ain't illegal  I'd say leave him me  Kick his ass to the curb if you wish but there's no reason to escalate the situation where everyone will know  It's not CP unless they're clearly naked     Edit  I'm an idiot  Never read it throughly obviously there were naked pictures     Try and convince him to get mental help  If you think for even a second that hes taking his "needs" further and is trying to physically hook up with children or talking to them online then call the cops  Better yet  sit him down to talk about it  He'll deny it at first and get irritated but don't get mad  act calm  Once he opens up find out all the details  Is it just a look and stroke the sausage type thing  or is  talking to children or trying to do things with them  Take it from there  As much as I don't think it's normal  I also don't agree with locking up someone in the same cell as a murder just because he was viewing images  Say what you want  let you closed minded fingers press the downvote button  That's my r unpopularopinion   I may have misspoken when I said "fun" like I'm talking about someone to hang out with and do things with  I wasn't talking about sexual "fun" like sleeping with a different guy every night    Sorry  I don't have a lot of experience with dating  I like 25 28  I guess I'd also consider someone my age and older too  I'm pretty lonely relationship wise so I guess I shouldn't be too picky      Thank you  I am looking into it  I've never heard of it before  Ask them to go to an event with you or do an activity with you  Then you can have that connection in person with them  In addition to this  sounds a little bit like gaslighting too  Thank you for all the information  Any history of trauma  Ever try being silly and after the dance  bow and kiss their hand and say "m'lady"   Edit  Sorry  this probably wouldn't work on "normal" girls  just weird ones like myself  I don't do "fault"   Ever    I'm perfectly happy if you were to believe everyone's weight problems are entirely my fault    It makes no difference to me   This is simply something I have done  that works for me   It may work for the OP who is concerned about weight gain  it may not   There is no downside to knowing how many calories you are eating  Small but important distinction  OPs habit of binging and then purging by fasting is more characteristic of bulimia than anorexia   Dang  that is a pretty tough spot  Have you talked with any Realtors that specialize in cheaper homes  I don't know the area well  but that might be your best bet other than moving away  which probably isn't what you want  I think you need to look introspectively here  You are angry at your "friend"  who you never met  because she didn't go on a date with you and because she got a boyfriend  She's not really at fault here  you are  You aren't and probably were never really her friend because the purpose was always to date her  You being upset at her for going out with someone else is actually kind of weird because it sort of implies that you had dibs on her despite never meeting her    For both your sake  you should probably stop talking to her   It might be best to tell them you can't help them out financially anymore  If it's too awkward you can just say money is tight right now    Only let them use your washing machine if you feel comfortable  Does 5 USD mean dollars  If so it's possible it was misplaced but they might have taken it  If you don't feel comfortable having them in your home please don't feel obligated  I've no idea why people in this thread are telling you to ask people you know for advice  This is an open and shut case        I study psychology  Pedophilia is an orientation and currently incurable  At most  he could work with a psychologist and take a medication to curb his libido  It helps that he seems to have an attraction to adults  in addition to children  Unless he is using you as a cover  which is possible  In the case that he's attracted to both  it's easier for him to fight against his lust for children  Will he though  Who knows  Child porn is not a victimless crime  Love is not something that overcomes all  I think that you should tell the police and break up with him  If not  confront him  and order him to see a psychologist  right away        I think that you'd be very selfish if you let this go  and ignore it  You'd be placing your relationship before the safety of children  Your relationship is unimportant compared to preserving the innocence of children  You decide for yourself  You don't have to if you don't want to    Please listen to this This American Life  episode  https   m thisamericanlife org radio archives episode 522 tarred and feathered act 2 act 2  on the topic of pedophiles    This opened my eyes and made me see those afflicted with it as deserving of some compassion   That being said  those photos  in a lot of cases  are putting a child at risk  The child is the important one for your SO to consider  It's not a victimless crime just because your SO only looks  I have no preferences with most races  but I just have an aversion to facial hair no matter the skin color  And now beards seem to be all the rage     Tough growing up with many traumatic happenings  That could lead to "closing in"   empathy loss  when painful happenings occur again   That's probably a good idea  but what confuses me is that I've been very drunk many times before to the point of feeling ill and throwing up  and not once have I shown any signs of aggression  That's why it's so scary because it's like I wasn't myself  I work at a property management company full of Realtors haha Dang  then you'd know all about where to look and what's available      that sucks  and I wish I could offer more help  but it doesn't sound like you have a lot of options   How many doctors have you been to  When their medication didn't work or do anything  did you follow up with them afterwards   For this to flare up and be so severe that it puts you out of commission for 10 days several times  3 4   throughout the year  that's a serious issue  I assume it also has a constant baseline of discomfort outside of flare ups that make the time in between also uncomfortable   My wife has a thin stomach lining  so maybe 2 3 times per year she has a really strong pain burn for a few hours  but then it's over  If it was so bad that she was out for weeks at a time  that's something you've got to relentlessly pursue with doctors    When my best friend was 17  he got these really bad heart palpitations  The thing is though  the doctors didn't see anything that was wrong  They would run some tests  but everything looked fine  He didn't have trouble unless he was doing something strenuous  like playing basketball with us   When that happened  his heart would race almost 200 beats per minute  at 220 you have heart failure    He saw 10  different doctors  none of which found anything  They would tell him it was probably nothing since their tests didn't find anything  and they would say to come back if it happened again  Well  it would happen again and when he went back  they still couldn't find anything so again they would shrug it off  Exasperated  he turned to natural remedies  but of course that didn't cure it either  Finally  after the several doctors he saw  he saw a new one and explained what was happening  This was when he was 23 or 24  He explained it   the doctor ran some tests  then came back and confirmed that his heart was beating out of sync  3 of the 4 chambers would beat at once  but 1 chamber beat at a different time than the rest  They need to beat at the same time to properly push your blood and distribute oxygen  so only having 3 4 of the power is what caused his body so much stress  After running that test and diagnosing him  a week later they had him in the OR for open heart surgery  They fixed the issue and now 7 years later he's still all better  But  he had that issue for 6  years before he finally found a doctor who could help him   I know it feels hopeless right now and like it's something that you just have to live with  but that seems like such a serious issue if you can't work for over a month every year  when you add the time up   There's got to be some underlying issue that they can treat   Outside of all of that  in the meantime you need to get a job  right  So find a job  don't mention this issue  then when it pops up  go to your doctor and get a report from them detailing your medical issue and that you might need intermittent time away from work for 5 10 days at a time  or whatever the doctor will agree to   Explain to your employer at that time that you were diagnosed with this debilitating Gastritis and see if they can accommodate you for this   If you work at a job for a year or more  then you are entitled to FMLA leave and a protected under that act  The employer needs to have at least 50 employees  and you must have worked there for 1 year and worked at least 1 250 hours in that previous year in order to be eligible  If you are eligible  then you get up to 12 weeks of unpaid time off per year for any qualified medical conditions  At that time  get the doctor to fill out your FMLA paperwork and then you'll be set  No employer is going to fight this once you're protected  The issue is making it 1 year at a company  That's where if you talk to them when it comes up  then they should hopefully be more sympathetic  By that time  hopefully you've demonstrated that you're a good employee and do good work  If that's the case  they could accommodate these one off situations until you're eligible for FMLA  I work in HR and I'm sure my company would be accommodating of something like this if the employee is a good employee  Thank you  Unluckly  he likes people of the opposite gender of mine That sucks  man  I'm sorry you're feeling so rough right now    The only thing I can think of is to say that exercise is good for relieving tension  Go for a jog workout if you can      Also  have you visited  r wholesomememes  I love that place  '  Seriously  you need help  You're so desperate for attention  You make new accounts and post everyday despite getting advice  Your looks are not the issue  it's your desperation and personality perhaps  Again  YOU'VE BEEN TOLD  go to a psychiatrist ASAP    EDIT  This guy is a troll    https   imgur com a nULwM My looks are an issue because I get told I'm ugly I'm an entrepreneur and I need polite small talk not to scare people off  I need to collect info about them to reuse some of their concept in my pitch  I'm not looking for a real connection on my part   but I don't need to tell them this      In my country there's still stigma for women who don't bear children  I don't want to discuss feminism with this people  I need to be kind and appropriate  Oh I should have been more specific   I meant moving back to the city where I grew up where my family still resides   I wouldn't be living with them   I would be living on my own and fully financially supporting the child   I just meant I would need some emotional support and help with childcare once in a while    PLEASE  Dude  unless you yourself are paying attention to ugly girls  you're being a massive hypocrite because you expect girls to do things that you yourself won't do   Your standards and expectations are unrealistic   You'll have success with girls if you go after girls who are in your league   Think about it from the girl's perspective  if you were a 10 10 girl  would you go after a 5 10 guy     I've seen your posted pictures are you really aren't ugly   Not a hottie but definitely average   Which means it's your personality and body language turning them off   You come across as extremely desperate even on the internet  so I can only imagine how needy and desperate you seem IRL   Your neediness and desperation are symptoms of an underlying problem  and you   need   to get some kind of mental health resources     Whether it's a support group  a private counselor  whatever  you need to talk to a professional   Unless you get help for your underlying problems  you won't find success with woman   Girls can tell when a guy is unstable and we tend to avoid men like that because we've all heard how dangerous it can be to date an unstable guy   Needy  desperate  average looking girls don't have success with handsome men either  Maybe point out the things you love the most  Wow   When all else fails defame the character of your opposition   Yeah im outta here  Leave  Now   This is abuse  I know the core thoughts made sense but the ideas weren't connected  Looking back  it's like reading a plot summary of Robocop  LoTR  and Shrek  one paragraph each  I'm glad someone is there to love the snorers  If I had my way they'd be segregated and left to sleep with each other  No  Listen to me now  The only advice you need is to go to a psychiatrist  Okay   If you think posting constantly on  r advice and  r amiugly will change anything  it won't unless you listen  Stop posting on here  Seek medical help  Up your confidence and move on   If you have things to say over text  it's fine  If you're not seeing them often  you can ask what they're up to and such  What's new  what's happening with whatever hobby they're into  what's up with your hobbies that you're doing  I don't live with my parents so I have no clue  No one ever says anything  so I guess they assume I must be happy  So tell them that too  All relationships are built upon communication  Whether it's a family relationship  romantic relationship  or a friendship   all are built on communication  If they're not communicating with you  then you tell them how that makes you feel   You don't know what the reason is  right  You don't know if they're mad at you  You don't know if they are sad about something  maybe a family member passed away and they are really broken up about it   You don't know if something traumatic happened  in a car accident and now they're paralyzed from the waist down and haven't come to grips with it yet   Or they could just be ignoring you   You tell them you're concerned about them and follow up with them  If they don't respond  then you tell them that it hurts your feelings to be ignored like this  If you did something that hurt them or bothered them  please let you know so that you can do something to address it and fix things  If you're just being too persistent or checking in too often  let's hear that too  Either way  you need to know if there's something you can do better or differently  At the same time  you have something for them to do better  or differently  and that's to communicate  If you're texting too much  then they should just say that  But just ignoring you is rude  So are you only going after white girls  That chart doesn't say much though I mean I prefer pizza over hamburger any day of the week  but if someone offers me a burger I sure as hell won't say no   If you love him  turn the phone to the police right now  next time he's asleep  If you love him  make sure he can't hurt children anymore   And don't let him know that you found his child porn  or he will delete it  And possibly hurt you   He has no qualms abusing children  what makes you believe that he will respect an adult enough to not harm her   Please listen to what everyone is saying  You've been told this before  Get help for your mental issues and then work on the rest     12 13 year olds completely nude selfies  That's child porn   Maybe wait a bit and try too develop those feelings  And if you never do  break up with her       Well  at least you have a really good friend to love  omfg the irony    Girl is ugly what does she do  Wears tons of makeup and then has that "I'm gods gift to men" attitude  a guys ugly  me  and they're shoved aside like a pice of shit  A girl can be ugly but get guys that like her a lot  but a guy needs to be the perfect 6 3" hunky sex god no less   What's your relationships with this person  How often do you have to see them   It sounds like no answer will please this person  It's possible but I haven't been examined by a professional  Maybe I'm just extremely lazy  This is what makes it pretty much impossible for me to practice but not what makes it so i can't play songs   If I read a tab and learn how a song is supposed to be played I still don't have nearly enough skill to play it  Of course you have to practice a song before being able to play it but playing songs is so far beyond what I can do so it seems to early to practice that way   It seems like the only thing I can do is simple exercises over and over  No  Child pornography is not a victimless crime  it is illegal for a good reason  Pedophilia should be addressed with therapy as soon as those interests arise  it is a very slippery slope from purchasing photos to pursuing live images to engaging children in inappropriate acts   Source  I'm not a therapist but my study is in abnormal psychology   Get help if you feel drawn towards children in a sexual way  please   Yeah I figured maybe that's what you meant but wasn't sure  What do you think it is about younger men that you prefer  I relate a lot to your last sentence as I stated in the OP also   It's not a date  just hanging out  Don't be nervous and talk to her like you would to any of your friends  If things go well and you have a great time then in future you could ask her out on a proper date  Have fun  Obviously not  because I'm not the most attractive guy  I'm pretty short and yet I've rarely been single and I'm happily engaged  It's not your looks  it's your mental state   Why do girls always say "oh I care about personality more than looks"  which is absolute bs  because the guy who's personality is fantastic will always be second best to another guy who's a few points better looking   Lots of good advice here  just want to make a quick point  I understand that you love him but if you stay with him and your relationship progresses and you have children with him  will you ever be able to trust him    I suggest that you tell him to go to his doctor and ask for help  They will alert the authorities and give him the support he needs and he will be helped as he turned himself in  If he doesn't do this you really don't have any choice but to go to the police  Being a pedophile and having these attractions to young children is one thing  actually looking for and storing child pornography is a step further towards actual child abuse  the kindest thing for everyone including him  is to stop this now and let the police handle it    I am so sorry as it's a horrible thing to deal with but it's not petty shop lifting or something trivial you might be able to turn a blind eye to  this is really really serious  Good luck  XX You've rarely been single because your probably manly and at least decent looking  if I was girl all I would have to do is put makeup on and I'd be hot just like that  A met a friend of a friend at New Year's  She's 12 years younger than me and absolutely the most gorgeous woman I've ever seen in person   She's in a relationship already and would probably not ever want one with me  But I would certainly go past the socially acceptable age gap line for someone like her  I've been an actress  mostly stage  for 5 years now after doing a drama school  and I also took a lot of singing classes  but it'll be the first time I'm auditioning for voice over  I'm a bit stressed because it'll be the first time I'll be acting on a microphone    The part they want me to audition is for a little boy  a little girl  and a bunch of animals  for a cartoon   so I'll have to modify my voice a lot  but they'll not give me the script before the audition  so I'll have to come up with a lot of different propositions  and different voices for characters I don't know yet  i'm searching right now to come with at least 5  different voices I can work on   Some people told me you have to somehow "overact" for cartoons characters and smile a lot while talking  but really this is all very new to me   They pretty much give me platitudes and then ignore everything else about me  I didn't realize how many people actually sympathize with viewers of child pornography  Shame on you all   Report this to the police immediately  They may be able to track down the source of the images and rescue a child from exploitation and worse   Really strange motivation  like there's some underlying subconscious pull to avoid inflation in the dating market Either you're a troll  or you need help with your mental state  Simple as that  That made me feel all mushi inside  Thanks  I think you're are assuming someone without confidence never tries     If they both try and 1 has some success while the other does not  guy with more success will have more confidence all other things being equal   There are entire websites dedicated to that pairing  if you're interested  I've actually seen plenty of Asian man Black woman couples in real life and online  there are quite a few YouTube couples   You're framing this situation like you either have to be sarcastic  or be quiet  Is it really so hard to be a genuine person that you would rather not say anything at all  Congratulations on reaching adulthood  That soul sucking feeling of working for money at some place you just don't want to be is just about right   But  you can find ways to make it suck less  Some are mental tricks of having a hobby  volunteering  or a passion outside of work that's a driving force to keep you working  Another way is to think outside of the box when it comes to jobs  Like actual tattoo parlors  art galleries  student assistant positions  screen printing shop  etc  Your job experience doesn't have to fit into the same experience as everyone else's  Do some footwork and talk to people  Make the phone calls and get face to face to make it happen  The Liberals' definition of "legitimate help"  includes the Murder of millions of babies each year among other things    See how that works  Uhm  Mind to share what that would be  Hair on the back  Mole on the nose  Some things can be fixed  Some can't    Nothing wrong with finding a good teacher to help  It's well worth the time and money  And you'd be surprised how much it takes to get a lot of kids to swim  My main advice is keep going at it  don't give up  Hi  I have updated the post with a small edit if this helps you to understand the situation even a little more clearly  Thank you for your input  I'm probably uglier and shorter than you dude  but I don't act desperate and my mental state is stable  I have the confidence to know how to act in situations and I'm now happily engaged  You can do the same but you need    NEED to work on the underlying factor which is your mental issues  I'm pretty sure those thoughts will stay as thoughts as long as you know it's wrong  As for standing up  you just have to do it  There's no other way to put it  Fight for what you want and for what you believe in  If you don't make it weird  it's not going to be weird    omfg the irony    Girl is ugly what does she do  Wears tons of makeup  No   That's not how this works   Makeup can only do so much   Makeup can't hide a fat stomach   Makeup can't hide a terrible  needy  desperate  unstable  scary persona   When do you ever see a "perfect 6 3" hunky sex god" hooking up with an unattractive woman in makeup     and then has that "I'm gods gift to men" attitude  Just because she won't fuck you specifically doesn't mean she's arrogant or thinks she's God's gift to men   You come across as extremely entitled    a guys ugly  me  and they're shoved aside like a pice of shit   For the last time  YOU ARE NOT PHYSICALLY UGLY   You know why you get "shoved aside like a piece of shit "  Because you ACT like a piece of shit   Actually I wouldn't be surprised if girls are  scared  of you because you come on way too strong and desperate and they don't want to be the next domestic violence statistic   You need serious mental help   You won't do any better with girls until your personality improves  and your personality won't improve until you get treatment for your messed up issues  That's how I feel    I've read about this phenomenon on my IPHONE the other day  I agree that you should go out  but maybe not to coffee  Try something less romantic  Your not uglier because of the position your in  rarely been single  probably at worst treated like a person by girls  Ok  Here's a question  if I done myself up for a night out and had confidence to burn would I get girls like you do or other guys do  You don't need me to answer that  the guy who's personality is fantastic will always be second best to another guy who's a few points better looking    How did you come to this conclusion   Certainly not personal experience  because your personality is clearly terrible  toxic  perhaps even scary   Get mental help  Just older  By weeks  months  whatever  As long as they're between my age and legal I'm not fussy  You're actually pretty lucky that you can already think of relevant questions to ask   Now it's just a matter of faking it until you make it   Yes  it feels fake   Yes  it  is  fake   But that's okay   Just have to force yourself  I think I misunderstood your proposal  I interpreted as they were still introducing a third person into the dynamic  which is just the epitome of playing with fire and has about a 0 3  success rate and given his abhorrence towards his own kink and desire to be rid of it  probably a 20 30  chance of him harboring homicidal thoughts towards the bull  If you got your mental health issues taken care of  didn't care about looks as much as you do and genuinely tried to be interested in a girl instead of worrying about your friends and didn't act creepy  you'd probably be fine  But everyone has told you  you will be a lost cause until you take care of your health  I guarantee that is your main issue   It just sucks that I'm working 50 70 hoe a week making ok money and can't buy a house  I'm kinda mad at the system and that the house market is so expensive  This post has been marked as  No Advice Wanted  NAW   https   redd it 21w712    Advice is subject

offmychest  if you have any questions or concerns   Thanks  just didn't know if it was customary thing or not This place has a really bad reputation  There's a reason I post here on my 2nd account and not my main one   People look at this board the same way they look at Incel and RedPill  While I don't think it's as bad here as it is in those places  I do think a lot of the posters in this sub aren't very accepting  You're very kind  thank you  okay thanks m  i was hoping i could avoid that but it looks like i might just have to suck it up I've waited for about 3 months now  she really loves me for some reason but I'm not sure I do yet  You have a better than average background  and stage voice projection is one step away from being a voice actor    Being a kid   in a production   is clearly a challenge for many adults  who have a hard time with being silly and childish     Cartoon work is overacting   but in a good way  One thing to think about is trying to make the different characters  have a individual style of voice  A large animal may need to have a BIG voice   while a pussy cat needs to be a little tiny voice    Accents may also come into play     A Russian wolf may require a suitable accent to go with the lines  I do a great British butler  a Scottish sea captain and  a cockney taxi driver  as well as a Chinese piano teacher   I say  put a smile in your voice  and get the job    Jim B   Haha Jesus Christ your so delusional  Have you seen the difference an ugly girl can make with makeup and a dress  They have super high standards   Iv worked in a bar for 4 years I should know    Secondly a lot of girls do think they're gods gift  funnily enough it's always the less attractive ones all done up for the night  I'm entitled yes  entitled to be looked at as a person  not looked down on beciase of my looks by girls who say "I don't care about looks it's personality"    For example  at work in bar restaraunt I serve a group of women girls and be polite and courteous etc  obviously just doing my job as I'm told to be like that  and more often than you'd think they never say thanks when I go out of my way to help them  don't expect a thanks but besides the point  abut the good looking guys I work with serve them and they're completely different  despite the fact I was more helpful    There a tons of different types of girls who guys like  but there is only one perfect man    Stop twisting my words you little skank  Thanks so much   This is proof that medication does more harm than good  Report it Yes  you have to report this to the police  Yes  you have to cooperate in the investigation    People seem to forget that within that scope of romantic love there are deal breakers  I am not sure why you feel that you have to enable him  and victimize innocents  just because you love him  You're being betrayed and hurt and put in danger by his decision to pursue illegal images  It would seem that the emotional balance is not equal anyways   Maybe you should talk to him and not post this online  There may be something you don't know  the ages might not be as low as you think  And the definition of porn is more than bikinis it's clear there is more from your post but the ages from those ones aren't clear  I'd never defend child porn or dirty pictures of kids but it's best if you speak to him first in my honest opinion  Are you sure  What country  Seriously  My mom and her husband can't even share a bedroom  She still looses sleep  I'm so very happy my man doesn't snore  Dude  You have serious issues  This is why you'll always be single  You just are rude and shitty towards people  GET HELP  Until then  you don't deserve the advice that people are giving you  Not to mention a bar is a rather terrible place to get women  You have such unrealistic expectations  it's stupid   What is the point in personality when I'm ugly   Yes I'm ugly girls call me it  once upon a time ago I had a nice personality and was called "a lovely guy"  believe that or not  but after so long of trying but only to be what Iv said people are with me  In all honesty it's been no different to when I was nice to when I don't bother anymore  You're showing some good judgement about your infatuation  Your fantasy makes you happy  but that fantasy is not the actual person  It's not her that's making you happy  it's the fantasy that your own mind made that's making you happy  You never even met her  it's one sided  You're using the thought of her to get some escape from being down   You might as well fantasize about me  a random comment on Reddit  That would be silly  right  With good reason too  There are a lot of places like that though where people work multiple jobs and can't make ends meet  It's one of the reasons I moved out to a podunk town from the big city  I'd love to move back someday  but right now we're still making it by  we have a house  and food  but we're not able to save as much as we'd like    It's probably good to get your frustrations off your chest though  as letting things out is generally seen as a healthy option  The context of work makes things a bit different  My apologies  I do still feel a small connection  however subtle  may help you out on this matter  It doesn't always have to be experiential  but can also be an emotional commonality  Finding the common ground can still be subtle  and gain you some respect as to the life you lead and your passion in the career path you've chosen  It could definitely change some things  I'm not so sure anyone really enjoys impersonal conversation  I don't know if I've helped out in any way  but I hope it's given you some food for thought on the matter  Good luck     You don't need to kill to be safe   Not having kids for one  I know that really hurts me dating wise but I don't have the baby rabies   Being more independent  I don't need or want to spend every minute with a SO  I need some alone time or to hang out with my friends and I assume he'd want time to hang out with his guy friends    Someone into more nerdy geeky things like comic books  anime  manga  board games  of course  and video games  Someone who doesn't think it's weird I want to carry around a d20 and roll to see if I get the Doritos at the grocery store   Someone also into fun stuff like go kart racing  roller coasters  zoos  etc  I guess it's more about being younger and wanting to have fun sometimes than being serious all the time   As long as the guy has a source of  legal  income to support himself  I don't need anyone wealthy  That's what I don't get about these girls on dating sites    why does the guy have to make  50k or more  To buy you crap    Sorry this is turning into a rant  Bottom line  just want someone low maintenance  Your telling me that firm behind a screen  You know what  Fuck off  Your delusional like the other sket posting telling me girls don't have double standards  Thank you so much for all you precious advice and your kindness Jim   I'll let you know if I get the part    It's not your fault  Please visit  r rape There is difference bietween an advice and a lecture  Your personality is ugly  your looks are not  You're so fucking backwards in your head  Stop worrying about girls or your looks  Worry about your mental health  because it's the ugliest thing about you  "That Cool Cafe" CALL THE POLICE  I don't understand the 'talk to a trusted adult' advice what so ever  This really needs to be reported to the police immediately  and you are not qualified nor are you equipped to deal with this  but the authorities are  You should go somewhere else until it's sorted and not deal with him one on one without others around until then  This is serious and there are far too many ramifications of not reporting it    Please  you know what the right thing to do is  so get the hell out of there immediately and don't go back until he is in custody  You can still be there for him later but this is absolutely beyond helping someone through a hard time  I don't know if I actually did anything to push them away or if the insecurities are really just in my head  But it is true  actions speak louder because they probably wouldn't spend time with me if they didn't want to and it's not like I made them hang out with me  If there are things I'm wondering if I did wrong  I guess I should just work on those anyway to be a better person so it won't be something that actually becomes a problem in the future  Maybe just being more confident and not so needy for validation will be the main thing I need to address   I'm sorry that you feel like you need to be alone at the moment until things even out with you and your friends  I relate to that and am used to be alone at times but it still kinda sucks  Thank you for being so open and understanding  Good luck and know that you have an empathetic ear internet stranger friend wishing you the best  It's not all about girls it's about life in general  Why do people complain about ugly people complaining  If you git treated like subhuman garbage because of the way you looked you would be bitter too Love can take time  I'd say wait about another month  Being "nice"     "fantastic personality "  You're  supposed  to be nice to people   Everyone is  supposed  to be nice to others   Being nice is the bare milquetoast minimum   Being nice is not interesting or fun   People with "fantastic" personalities are funny  interesting  etc   If your 5 10 nice self was chasing after 10 10 girls  of course you didn't have much success   Like I said before  you need to focus on girls who are in your league   Unless you were also going after "nice" 5 10 girls  you're a hypocrite who set himself up for failure with those unrealistic expectations  The person is my SO  which I sort of hesitate to put because reddit really seems to enjoy telling people it's hopeless and you should break up  instead of actual suggestions  We live together and have done so for 2 years  though we've been together 8  This is true  I appreciate the input sir   Yeah   I just tried to laugh it off  But on the inside I was like please stop guys   I thought about going out for a coffee because it could be nearby her house  and if I starting feeling that she was uncomfortable or something  I could avoid the cringiness of her being with me on the way home  But I'm open to other suggestions  EDIT  Also  about the spark coming back  do you think it's possible to overcome my feelings if they come back  Where are you talking to this guy that people just always get his attention  "Cultural Marxism" isn't a thing   It's a silly term trying to blame SJWs on Marx  who was not a SJW man hater   You can certainly find success in a romantic relationship if you are straightforward and honest with your partner about your needs  You just need to find someone that has similar values regarding personal time  That said  if you can't or aren't willing to compromise on occasion you will face difficulty in any relationship  There's no reason you shouldn't pursue someone romantically if it is something you want though  Yeah  I'm the delusional one and yet I haven't made a post and ignored every sensible person  I guess everyone is wrong and you're always right  If you didn't want advice  why do you post  Marijuana is not physically addictive and cannot cause those things  Do you maybe have the flu  You got advice first and after ignoring everyone  treating people like shit  you're getting a lecture  Dude  I just KNOW I'm going to ace my next test    gets a 45   Dude  I just KNOW that THIS TIME I'm going to ace my next test    gets a 32   DUDE  I have all the confidence in the world  I'm the smartest person in the world  Just watch as I ace this next test    gets a 54   "Oh  but see  You improved that last time  You just need more confidence "  'm entitled yes  entitled to be looked at as a person  not looked down on beciase of my looks by girls who say "I don't care about looks it's personality"    You're right  you do deserve to be look at as a person   Every woman also deserves to be looked at as a person  but you're not doing that   Don't you see the hypocrisy here   You expect so much more from women than you're willing to give to them   You expect them to look into your unique personality and soul  but you don't do the same to them   Your expectations are completely unreciprocal and unreasonable  Maybe you cite it as et al  Then you can provide a link or scan to the publication  I'm sure this happens a lot to people  It's very easy to find out that you were published   Sorry  I should have added this in the post  it's Bosnia and Herzegovina  And yes I'm pretty sure about how it works not from personal experience of course   basically the law says that if I'm aware of the act I'm guilty  even in cases where the intruder would've killed you  True  but if presented no other option End this non sustainable relationship and move on with your life  And  no  your edit doesn't change that advice  Well then deal with your life issues and see what happens  You get treated that way because of your mental issues  not your looks  No one just meets a person and goes  "you're ugly" that doesn't happen   This person keeps saying you're a bitch or grumpy  They are also the only person who says this to you   Any response you give only makes it worse and doesn't appease them   Are those correct  Oh I see  thanks for a detailed answer  I'm not very thrilled about kids either and that's a perk with older women  they most likely already have kids that are starting to grow up or they are without kids  At my age a lot of women wants kids  Obviously when they want the men to earn that much it's so they can bemefit from it  Btw what's a d20 and roll  Did I say I go after 10 10 girls  Not  Did I say I didn't use to be considered interesting and funny   Other people's words at the time not mine  no  Now I'm not because there's no point    niw am I a hypocrite  For not wanting to be treated differently because I'm ugly  I don't treat any girls differently by looks nor am I perv  You on a night out would get checked out by 2 guys one is 5 10 and you would be like "ugh yuk that guy is perving at me" but if attest an 8 10 looked at you  Different story  It's you who's the hypocrite  Go and try attar t guys with no makeup or fake shit on at all and see your attention lessen  at least you have that option    Are you from the UK may I ask   Yes and I told you what you can do with your lecture    Are you form UK   Yeah  unfortunately finding a therapist can be a long and drawn out process  But once you find a therapist you click with and trust  that relationship is better than gold  I've been through some fucked up stuff too  and my therapist has helped me overcome so much  I wouldn't trade him for the world  Break a vocal chord    Grin    Jim b   Honestly  ignore them  When someone says something  don't acknowledge what they said  Act like they never said it and move forward with the conversation  or walk away    Person 1   insert insult here  You  I can't believe it's so warm out today    Then exit stage left    Yeah exactly  Thanks for your replies  That's the right thing to do  It's easy to run through a million scenarios in your head and to think about your feelings and reactions to the whole thing  but it can all be solved relatively quickly by addressing this head on  If you go to them and explain how you feel  then they should understand and respond to you explaining themselves  If you go to them and explain how you feel but they don't respond  well then this just isn't a friend that cares very much about your feelings  No matter what happened on their end or what type of hard times they're going through  then they should be able to respond with a quick  "I'm alright  Been going through some shit and just haven't had much time lately  I'll hit you up when I can "  Who knows  Maybe they lost their phone  haven't gotten around to getting a new one  and since you only text maybe once or twice a week they thought it wouldn't be a big deal and you'd get back in touch when they get their new phone  Whatever the case  going directly to them should help get to the bottom of this ASAP  Well you can deal with being rejected by everyone and be miserable if you choose not to listen    I am not  I know you're scared  but to be honest  it sounds like you both need to step away from each other for a while  Breaking up sucks  but he will need time to process and get over what happened  and it sounds a bit like you need to figure out what goes on with you when you drink  Letting go is really scary  but it's best for both of you right now while the dust settles   Have you ever been like that before when drinking  I would suggest that  if it's a recurring thing  you need to get help   as you mentioned in your post  You might not be able to fix things with him  and I'm really sorry if that's the case  but you can make something good come out of this situation if you choose to reflect on it and make positive changes    Wishing you all the best  OP  It's like a predate date doing a date like thing without the intimacy   You are spending time together in a situation like a date trying to answer the question "we like each other could this be a thing " If it's not awkward and you have fun it could lead to something but if you don't feel the chemistry there doesn't need to be any more and neither of you lost out  You've got me all wrong haha  See a lot of guys will check girls out etc  good on them and good on the girl for getting positive looks  see I don't check girls out at all because I know she wouldn't like that because I'm ugl  which that doesn't bother me  I don't expect anything form girls obviously  it's when I'm minding my own business going the store a few nights ago and a group of girls shouting things at me  yuk  ugh  Ming  eeee state of him  and laughing at me  and then a while later they walked past my house with a group of thug type guys  nothing against the guys    worst is when  like any 2 Peopl can do  are by each other  like at my work  and a I look up to a girl already looking at me  not In A good way Iv never thought that  and she looks away with an utter attitude on her because she has that "I'm better than you" look on her face after and she thinks i was checking her out is why  not sure I said that right but hopefully you get my drift   Yeah  that's not how it works  Do you think you are mentally stable  You only seem to care about looks  you're all hung up on that   Or you know  it's scripted  Have YOU ever had "movie" style conversations    I enjoy the bustling atmosphere with lots of people  it makes me more productive    It's FUCKING distracting  no  no  no FUCK  Oh good for you   You cannot make it up to her  I don't know where people get this idea  All anyone can do is move on  In order to regain her trust I think a good place to start would be to not drink again any time soon    Everyone has deal breakers and breaking points  If you had hit one of hers then she would have already broken up with you  Perhaps this is a "fool me once" situation for her   Emergen c  Tea with ginger  honey and lemon  Sleep  Spicy food helps with congestion  as does peppermint oil  Echinacea also is supposed to help  Herb pharm is a good homeopathic brand  Goldenseal helps move phlegm  And drunk lots of water  Basically those tried and true old school remedies people used for ages   My mum is oblivious to my FA'ness and just says I need to meet more women  Then I'll have plenty of interested girls according to her  Dad couldn't care less but from what I've gathered  he thinks I'm weird for being single  I think you could  I know it can be hard and take a long time  but being bitter isn't healthy for you both biologically and psychologically  You deserve to be happy and treated kindly  You deserve and have the right to live your life and be out in public  If someone has a problem with you  then that's their problem  not yours   Virtual Internet hug   I say you should go and talk to a professional to determine what the best treatment is for you as there seems to be quite a few a characteristics of different conditions like ocd anxiety and depression which suggests your diagnosis may not be completely straight forward  so it would be best to try and clear that up and avoid self diagnosis in my opinion  Although I'm not one to talk as I've never been in therapy  Although I do have many of the symptoms of those 3 conditions you mentioned  I have extreme anxiety and ocd I am certain  But I am seeking a psychologist now to sort it out as it isn't always black and white especially with something like anxiety which affects the way you perceive things so much  it's hard to be objective when you're under its effects  and the mix of symptoms just complicates things further  Just out of interest have you been self medicating  I'm in a similar position to you where I'm starting to consider medication as it's getting really bad  but have always been a bit scared of anxiety medication  like Xanax if I was prescribed it i'd be scared to take it    hope I helped a bit anyway but I'm not too informed sorry  Yeah sorry  I noticed it once I actually posted it lol   That's because looks is everything everything EVRYTHING  Iv lost out on so many job prospects etc to a guy less qualified be issue the girl interviewer doesn't want an ugly guy  true story  I'm the same way OP  Except I legit don't care about others  I don't even have that "yearning" to interact and I'm never lonely  I actually hate people for the most part  My dream in life is to one day live alone in the woods  No traffic  no urban noise  no people  Ahhh that would be sweet   But yea  I just accept it as me being selfish and of the millennial generation where it's add and all about me  aka reality TV syndrome   I've come to just accept it if I'm being honest   Why isn't just hurting her him enough to get away to safety enough for you  Being so eager to kill isn't healthy Netipot Essential oils Please listen to me  okay  I've felt the same way you have  I felt like nothing ever works  I felt like I tried everything  I felt worthless and hopeless and alone  I've attempted suicide  I tried to hang myself from a tree in a forest near my home  I took a belt from my parents' room and went for a walk  On the way there I was terrified  but also relieved  I just wanted to end the pain  I set everything up  made a noose and climbed up the tree  I was ready  and I thought that it was my only way out  I prayed for forgiveness  then counted to ten and dropped from the branch  It broke  I had never felt so much like a failure  I sat on the forest floor and cried my eyes out  then waited for the red marks on my neck to fade and returned home  I was fourteen years old  I'm not going to lie and say that everything turned out okay  It is still a struggle  All my problems are still there  I still need lots of help and support  But the reason I didn't attempt again  and the reason that I never will attempt again  was the look on my mother's face when I told her what I'd done  It absolutely broke my heart  My family and friends all reacted strongly  but it was that look that got me the most  I imagined what it would be like in her shoes  having my only daughter  still a teenager  destroy her body and take her own life  I would never wish that pain on anyone  I know you're in a lot of pain right now  but you can be saved  You aren't too far gone  no matter what you may think  I know  I've been there  Finding the right support is key  Therapy and healthy living aren't the only solutions  There are plenty of organisations that can help you  trust me  There's also hotlines you can call  friends who you can talk to  numerous places where you can get advice and support  Medication is difficult  it can take a long time to get the right combination and dosage  But you will find it eventually  And one of the best things you can do  Live life to the fullest  and live it how you want it  You can have so many amazing experiences  find out amazing things  Do something you've always wanted to do  I know this may not make any difference  but I care about you  and I hope that you find happiness  I hope that you make it out of this awful place  because that is no way to live or feel  You can do it  I believe in you and I want you to know things to get better  I'm glad I stuck around  because although life isn't perfect  there's hope and there's happiness  PM me if you want someone to talk to  and I'm sending lots of love  Stay strong xx Maybe baking soda  Lush makes a foot powder  The bottle lasts for a long time    http   www lushusa com body foot care t for toes 03635 html   This stuff works wonders   99 99 percent of all people go their entire lifetime without ever having to kill someone in self defense  I have been a little over the top while drinking before  going past my limit  having a panic attack  running off crying  etc  but it was normally really uncommon a one time thing  Now about half the time I drink  I get really sad and feel abandoned or not cared for  It's just been getting worse so I've decided I'll be happier if I don't drink  I've also made an appointment with my doctor to see what he says and to get referred to a therapist or however that works   Thank you for the advice  I'm trying to think positively and I'm doing everything I can to be a better person from now on  It's hard for us to say why he acts the way he does  The best way to figure it out is to have an honest and frank conversation with him about it   I would sit him down some time when you're at home and ask if he has some time to talk  This lets him know that it's a serious conversation and not something that you can talk about in passing  Don't let any distractions occur  turn TV off  have conversation somewhere private that you're unlikely to be interrupted  etc     Sit down and just hit right at the heart of it  Tell him that you've observed over the years that when he is with customers or strangers  he lies about things  experiences  or greatly embellishes the truth  He does it less so with people he's close to  but he still does it  Tell him that as he continues to do this  it erodes the trust you have in him  Not only do you automatically not believe most of his stories  but you have a hard time telling if anything is the truth or if it's a lie   He might try to wiggle out of it  He'll say something like  "Tell me one lie I've ever said " then when you say one he'll start arguing about how that one in particular was true  The key to avoiding this is to not get sucked into it  If he says  "Name one time   " then don't take the bait  You just stick to your guns and say  "Dad  stop  Look  you know it  and I know it  You lie  I'm not here to be mad at you or start an argument about it  I'm not here to judge you  but I just want to see what we can do to put this behavior behind us  I love you  and I want to trust you  but right now I just can't  Where does this behavior come from and what can we do together to help fight through it " Yeah  you're wrong buddy  And I don't believe your story  I think you make this stuff up to validate yourself  But do you think you are mentally stable   He's just a bad boy with a good heart  can't you see   He wasn't afraid of losing me as a friend   I know the reason why he was suicidal and it certainly wasn't that   I didn't involve more people but   D told me  and we both went to our Head Of Year   I involved no one   There was no choice in it  I was forced into this situation   The main reason I got involved in the aftermath was because C was threatening D   Allegations were then thrown at me and that's where my anger came from   I was pushed into a situation  D and I did the right thing and then I'm told that I'm 'not a true friend' and that I 'ignored him in his time of need'  which I had no idea about as I was only told that morning    I'm sorry  but I escalated nothing   My apology would be for how things left off  nothing to do with an escalated situation   I appreciate your advice nonetheless  however  I standby what I've said  that I did not escalate any situation  You're making massive assumptions about these women   You're not in any way looking at them as individuals   If you truly were minding your own business it was rude of those girls to laugh at you  but you shouldn't have let it bother you that much   People are rude to strangers all the time   If you're taking random remarks by strangers that personally  you seriously need to talk to a therapist and get some better coping skills   Additionally  how do you know their boyfriends were thugs   You've never met those guys   You are sick of people making assumptions and judgements about you  yet here you are doing the exact same thing    I look up to a girl already looking at me  not In A good way Iv never thought that  and she looks away with an utter attitude on her because she has that "I'm better than you" look on her face after and she thinks i was checking her out  Unless you're a psychic mind reader  there's no way you can know she's thinking that   This is called "projection"  you already believe she thinks she's better than you  no matter what she does  so you'll interpret everything she does as a fulfillment of what you already believe   This is something you can work on with a therapist or support group  They were gasping when they saw the cue on the screens facing towards them  Nonetheless are shows like this part of the brainwashing  Communication is super important  If he can't grow up and be open about it  and you have talked about the issue  I don't think your relationship will end well  You even said this is something you're not sure you can get passed  I would suggest ending it now before it gets worse or bring up your communication issues and tell him how serious you are about it   It almost never bothered me about the fact that I don't have a girlfirend and stuff like that but for some reason it started to get to me when one of my friends jut got married and I didn't even have a girlfirend     I know I don't have to be desperate  I'm not going to be getting into a relationship  with any girl just to be in one  I want to find a girl that clicks with me with which I to get into a relationship   The confident part I'm still working on  I'm still in the phase of fake it till you make it  but really my only lack of confidence is the fact that I don't have the experience  I'm also struggling with fear of failure and trying to get over it  might as well do both   I've been thinking of getting on a dating app site but I just didn't cause I'm not really that photogenic and also it's still texting and I suck at it  I'm better in person cause I can read the mood and her reactions but in text you can't really get emotions across so I kinda think they're not interested  especially when they're not trying to make conversation and all the work is left on me  or when they answer far too slowly   yeah  I'm really bothered by that haha   Yeah  let's hope 2017 will be a better year than 2016  I got a feeling if it will at least be interesting    Haha I swear on my mothers grave I'm not making this up lol that's not even the half of ot  Yeah I have no interest in ever dating I should just stay single forever  You wanted advice and people  not just me  are telling you the same thing  it's not your looks  You have no idea what I look like  It's 100  your personality and mental state  I guarantee it    Iv lost out on so many job prospects etc to a guy less qualified be issue the girl interviewer doesn't want an ugly guy  true story   How do you know that's why you didn't get the job   Did the interviewer tell you that   Because  as everyone who's seen your pics has said  you're not at all physically ugly   You're average looking   If average looks kept people from getting hired  75  of the world would be unemployed  my projected numbers were pretty close to reality    About 20  percent would date asian guys  About half would date someone 5'4"  soo  20  5   10   My actual response rate was around 10 percent    of that 10  80 percent were saying hey sorry Im not interested    Of the rest they died withing 2 messages pretty much    Yeah maths Thank you so much  I've been feeling pretty down lately  you've managed to cheer me up  Even at my age fuck dating we all know how it ends Where are you from   Be worried about places without good security  If anything this story shows you can't be too trusting because of impersonators  not because of doctors giving you the wrong diagnosis  No I overheard them say it  Drinking seems to be a problem for you   I'd look into AA and possibly take a break from your relationship   Least all I can say is good luck   About the gaming thing  I play by the rules that people don't need to know shit about me when I'm gaming  I've had people do what you said  we're playing and then we get into talking and someone thinks they are important enough to TMI all of a sudden  Like  Neat  cool But during A game  who cares and the worst that can happen will happen because not everyone is progressive  we're online trying to escape life for a bit  not get real    Any way  you got this  I believe in you  Just don't live life looking to be A victim or making your life harder then it needs to be  try to look at situations from different perspectives  Some little fat pudgy girl said to to another staff crossing my name out on the sheet "nooo not him wev got enough ugly men around here"  Overheard them how  That makes no sense  You usually leave after an interviewer and if you stayed and creeped  that's pretty messed up    You're creating these lies to try and justify your insane behaviour and thoughts  Seek psychiatric help  Anna and Rose are a holes  Plain and simple  Leave them in their toxic dumpster and find people who deserve your friendship    Coincidences like this happening a lot over a short period of time can make us question reality a lot  Similar things have been happening to me where very unlikely events happen basically and it seems like everything has been organised and planned to happen as it does if that makes sense  I'd say it is very unlikely to be more than coincidence  but as a huge skeptic I wouldn't dismiss it  Maybe you have a gift aha  just see over time if it continues or try and find other people who have had similar experiences to you to get an idea  you're in the right place  There's a lot of weird phenomena that happens in the mind that doesn't appear to have an explanation but is reported all the time like astral projection  Maybe we just don't understand the human mind and reality enough to determine how it can be possible  but it still very well may be  Try and consider other possible logical explanations for this  but I'd say just see if it remains accurate predictions over time that would be your best way to tell  Do you think you are mentally stable  If you don't trust you doctor and pharmacist  it's a good time to replace both   That's an illegal hiring practice in the U K   If that actually happened  you could successfully take legal action against them  Yes more than enough  there's a rant In all of us Why do you want to know   This is the second time you've asked me that  It's not super often  maybe once or twice a month  To be fair  he may be the only person who feels like they could let me know if I were being bitchy  my coworkers wouldn't say anything  I dunno if my friends would  My mother does  but it's obvious to me when I say something I shouldn't to her and I get the reaction I expect    For simplicity's sake  I suppose the answer to both is yes  Wishing you all the best OP  it's so brave to admit that you need help  You sound like an amazing mother  I know all you see are your shortcomings  but I bet you that your kid loves you more than anything in the world  One day it'll all be worth it   However  you need to take care of yourself  It takes a lot to finally say 'I need help ' I resisted getting help for months and got progressively worse  until one day I was like 'I can't keep wanting to crash my car every time I go out  I can't keep running to grab the pills when I can't take it anymore  I can't keep spending my days thinking of ways to end it ' I just couldn't  It's exhausting  And I know that unwillingness  that stubbornness to seek help  but admitting you need it is one of the strongest things you can do  Don't suffer in silence    Meds won't necessarily make you a zombie  I was lucky and got the right ones for me on the first try  I finally got up  got a job  started living my life a little again  It just takes the edge off  Not every day is sunshine and rainbows  but it makes shit a little easier to deal with  Makes you not want to just run in front of a bus when the self hatred takes over  It helps you realise that those thoughts are not you  that they're irrational and they will pass  But it takes time  For me  it got a little worse before it got better  so don't be afraid to lean on people you love   We're all here for you too  we're rooting for you  Best of luck OP and I hope that your appointment went well today  Thinking of you  and I just want you to know that a stranger is proud of you  You're brilliant    Just curious  I never really pay much attention to politics so thanks for informing me about that I don't want to come up as a rude person  but if she is putting so much effort into it  it means she truly likes you  but if you are unsure about it  you probably don't like her that much  If you don't have strong feelings for her  you probably shouldn't have dated her in the first hand  because you might never have those strong feelings for her and you might eventually break up with her  And she will be devastated for sure  I don't know you  nor this girl  but if she is willing to go so far for you  I bet she is a great girl that probably doesn't deserve this  My sincerest advice would be to have a real talk with her about it before it's too late  Waiting up for your feelings to come  when you're not even sure they will ever come is just bad  both for you and for her It's my word against there's  And you were in the room looking at the sheet to know they crossed off your name to confirm right    Not to mention if they had a sheet  I imagine they interviewed more than two people  and even IF  which I highly doubt  had said that  it could have been anyone  But he never sought to confide in me   He chose to talk to D  which is fine   The reason why he never came to me however  was because he thought I was a backstabber   This didn't come from D and I going to our Head Of Year   Truth be told  C said that D was his only friend  despite everything that we had been through up until that point   Yes  I ignored him   There was such a distrust between the two of us  that I just didn't want to face him anymore   Despite that apology  tensions were still very high between us  and time just flew by   But that doesn't mean that I'm not regretful for what happened or how things ended   I am   That's what this is about  I would definetly not be interested in getting into a conversation with some random man or woman on the street  I have better things to do and they should too  Who cares  Masturbate  I do it multiple times a day every day  My brain works great  I'm not fat  I'm not depressed even tho I have things that should depressed me  Your're the only one limiting yourself  There was a group of us there   I went to the toilet down a little corridor and on my way back I heard her say it after the other staff said my name asking her before she crossed my name out  Probably is xD  d20   20 sided die You roll to see if you accomplish a task  It's a D D reference  Sounds like you're in a dissociative state  My advice  find a therapist and get medicated  Both saved my life  Read some of my other comments  I have lists of things I do  I find that mindfulness is the biggest thing that helps me  I often find myself feeling sad or anxious when thinking of the past or the future  so staying in the moment is necessary for me to feel happy and optimistic   Some of the most useful things for me are writing about my feelings  going through CBT exercises   a couple great apps are Calm in the Storm  The Worry Box  Moodspace  Moodtools  there are a lot more out there too  Find something that works for you  Understanding your thought patterns can do wonders for getting past negative cycles   Other things that help me     exercise  forces me to be in the moment and clears my head   reading  getting my mind off of myself and thinking about other things   creating  I love making crafts and jewelry  It gives me an outlet to express myself and keeps my mind busy    playing with pets   reading about other people  whether it be articles  videos  reddit threads  etc  focusing on other people's lives and hardships puts mine into perspective  It forces me to stop thinking about only myself    Hope some of these help you too  You can message me if you would like to  MASTURBATE FOREVER IF IT MAKES YOU HAPPY  You say you want to kill yourself  and have tried before  You really    REEEEALLY think that mentally stable people want to kill themselves   Your whole story makes no sense   Why would they have even said that in front of you   Why would you even be present when they were crossing names off the list   That's highly unusual  Well  I'd say I feel regret for ignoring their message   I was blinded with anger at that point  and really just wanted to think   Time just flew by too quickly   I have a message planned and written  I just don't know if I should send it is all  A sane and reasonable person who knows your mentally unstable   Works every time  http   i1 kym cdn com entries icons original 000 014 711 1380697092809 jpg  Why does it matter though   Why did you only ask me this question and none of the other commenters  wow  nice  What country may I ask  in the U S   this is NOT the case at all  A few states are opening up the records to some extent  only for adults   but other states you'd basically would need an executive order if even that to get at the records  I didn't know what that meant until I looked it up just now  Some of the "telltale signs" rang true which on the one hand was scary but on the other hand comforting because it looks like I'm not going crazy  I don't think she's doing it on purpose  she never shows an ounce of weakness  never backs down  and never second guesses herself even when I feel like I remember something more accurately than her  She gets down on herself pretty hard and I think her past trained her to be that way for self preservation  I think I may have put myself in this situation to keep her from plummeting into depression which was something we faced earlier into our relationship  I'll talk to someone about it because I also want to help her  She's done therapy in the past and I want to do it first this time around so it's not a situation where I flat out tell her she's wrong and needs help  I want to get better too if I can  Dude  I'm not some bloodthirsty maniac  If someone broke into your house with a gun  it's either you or him  If he's some amateur robber that's unarmed of course I'm not going to kill him  Tell him that you consider his debt to you paid  and that you gave him that money as a gift in the first place   Taking care of himself and his needs is more important than paying you back as far as you are concerned   Then  what you do with the friendship after that is up to you       Good luck  Yeah  that didn't happen  Why are you asking for advice if you're going to be rude and not listen  I'm well aware  this is just a what if scenario Do you suffer from anxiety depression  Because it sounds like the alcohol exacerbates any underlying issues that you may have  Are you stressed out   You're taking steps to improve the situation  you've recognised there's a problem  That's a brave thing to do  It sucks that there was a catalyst for that  but honestly you're doing all you can right now  You can't reverse what happened  and I know you wish you could  but what you're doing now counts for a lot  It means you won't do something like that again   I'm rooting for you  Try to be strong  try to be open to taking a break while you fix what's going on  It's hard when you really love the person  but he needs to do what's best for him too  I know you understand that  even if the idea of it is hard to accept  x It sounds like her lawyer has grounds to sue for libel  Also  video surveillance may lead to criminal charges for trespass  property damage and theft  It seems to me that these protesters are flirting with criminal records and jail time  Iv tried 4 times  with a belt on a door handle  I'm desperate to do it  desperate  And if I don't I'll one day join Isis and blow a load of people up or shoot them or chop their heads off  at least then I'll have some purpose  I watch Isis killing people videos all the time  yesterday I watched a video where they killed a guy by running over with him with a tank  I got a thrill from it  thought to myself  that's me one day doing that with a grin like no other  I'm not joking lol I watched one earlier   I'm really sorry to hear how a tough a place you're in right now  I'm no psychologist so I can't pretend to know what you're experiencing but I can say that I think you should talk to a therapist or whatever and then discuss with somebody what they think the best course of action would be as I know it can be pretty hard to think rationally during times like these   Hope everything turns out for the best  if you ever need somebody to talk to don't hesitate to message me   You seem to have a drinking problem and I don't understand why you're making yourself out to be the victim in this situation  Be happy you're not facing domestic violence charges and work on healing yourself  The alternative is for people to wonder if you might be incel which is one of the lowest status positions in our society    Yep  Okay  now I know you're trolling   I am almost 21  been single my whole life  Now I'm not the most outgoing guy  so one thing I want a relationship for is that constant source of companionship  which sounds really nice  Plus  it's a constant source of sex  which sounds great too  Many of my friends who have gone through relationships and break ups tell me that it's better being single though  And hey  they might be right  But I really want to try a relationship for myself first    Edit  I totally understand what you're saying though OP and I envy your attitude about this  Keep the lawyer  and consider getting a restraining order against these girls    Lol this world is such a fucking joke   La Libert  is being redefined  now on death the government has a presumption of ownership of your body   This is a slippery slope and a  prcdent terrible   There are special locks keys that are not duplicable  but it really depends if your landlord has them and wants to actually use them   I'm really sorry this is happening to you though  I live in a three bedroom with four guys and we have people over all the time  but we and our guests  know better   Just remember  you're worried for not only your safety  but everyone else's since you live in a shady neighborhood  your boyfriend has a gun  and you don't know these people  Good point  I might be reaching the end with this one  Been wasting a lot of time  Appointment next Monday  Good luck to me I know where the other guys form  Jim not asking for city street and door number just the country  UK or US  I'm form the UK  See lol It sounded like you're whining about not being able to kill     I swear to god I'm not  I do watch Isis videos a lot  and I wouldn't say no to being accepted by them  On my mothers grave I'm not lying or trolling   You'll learn over time that part of being an adult is having these difficult conversations  I'm 30 and I'm officially in my "cut through the shit" stage now  As you get older  you get more busy and have less time  It becomes more difficult to stay in contact with people  even family   so it takes real effort  On top of that  since you have limited time for your limited relationships  you want them to be healthy ones   Confrontation is difficult  but it's not inherently a bad thing  People think of confrontation as bad  but if it's approached correctly it's the most healthy thing possible   Think about if you like a girl  You get to know her  you have a crush on her  You hang out a bit and you flirt a bit  It's fun and exciting and you want to take it to the next level  but you're afraid of rejection and having her make a big deal out of it  So you just go on the way things are hoping that at the right time things will fall into place  So you spend months on this girl  maybe years   and finally you get sick of waiting around and ask her out  Either she says yes and you realize you could have been dating her months and months ago  or she says no and you realize you wasted so much time chasing a girl who wasn't into her   Or  you approach this scenario the 30 year old way and as soon as you like her say  "Hey  I really enjoy spending time with you and you're really good looking on top of it all  What would you say to going out on a date with me this Saturday " Bam  Cut straight to it  Either she says yes and you get right to it  or she says no and you are free to chase after a girl who actually likes you   Same situation here  Either you can spend all this time waffling around not wanting to get rejected or make a big deal out of things  or you speak up for yourself  You have feelings and it's okay to address that  If this person is any kind of friend then they will want to do what they can to make you feel better and to prevent this sort of thing from happening again   Sometimes there are just disconnects or miscommunications in relationships  and they need to be figured out and addressed  No voluntary relationship should ever make one or both of the people feel bad  If something like that happens  then the two people in that relationship need to work together to make sure it doesn't happen again  If there's enough of these situations that keep popping up or if one person's intentions don't align with the other person's  then it becomes time to end the relationship and find someone who better aligns with you  But if you never bring this up  he never knows there's an issue   Lastly  I'll tell you a quick story about my best friend  Back in high school my friends and I hung out all the time  We would initiate every hangout and call him up to join  Sometimes he wouldn't want to go  so he would just ignore us  When we text and call and don't get a response  we give him some time to respond because it would be better for us if he was there than if he wasn't  But when this kept happening  we kept wasting an hour here or an hour there waiting for him to call back that he would or wouldn't go   Finally we confronted him about it and said  "Dude  it's okay if you don't want to hang out every time  Even if you've got nothing going on  just say  'Sorry guys  I'm just gonna chill at home' " It's perfectly fine if he wants to not come  but he should just let us know then so we don't wait around  After we confronted him about that  he was really good about responding and no one's feelings were hurt  That's a much better ending than us just continuing to get ignored by him and not addressing it  Rarely  but enough that I can see why they're written like they are  Sometimes you're on point and say the most clever things  And some people are much better at it than others  You need to pull out the big guns here  I'm sure she would appreciate the gesture if you took her out    glad you're ok OP  sounds like you've got a great girl there  Hope it all works out  I am going to start seeing a therapist soon because tomorrow I plan on getting that help and I'm not just ignoring what he's trying to say I understand something's he's said and I'm using that to help myself improve but some other things I'm just not sure I can do maybe it's possible but it's not a easy thing Nothing is different   We still have our mutual friends  and we haven't spoken since   Whenever we're in the same room  it's an awkward atmosphere   However  my plan would be to apologise for ignoring their last messages   I was angry and needed time  and as I've said time just flew   I have it all written out  I just don't know if I should send it   I'd hardly think that it has anything to do with my ego   And I struggle to see how it would help my ego   I feel regretful for how things between him and I left off   That's what I'm feeling  They lose them like they get them  honey  And by that time  you'll be out with girlfriends having a good time or cuddled up with a REAL man watching a movie and won't even care  It's just like exercise let it hurt  feel it  Cry  scream  get it out  Don't hold onto a single feeling he's left you with  Let it go  When it's all over  love will fit a little more deeply inside you  thanks to him  Be well  friend  Do not make posts like anymore  especially if you're not going to participate after you make it  Only warning  You not going to answer  Just want to know are you British or American or anything else  Because it's different to what we've been talking about in other countries  If that's how you truly feel  I hope you do die then so that you don't do anything stupid to others  No wonder nobody likes you   the type of relationship I have with my girlfriend is your typical vanilla relationship  She is extremely jealous of any girl I talk to or look at for more then a second  I also get somewhat jealous  This is natural as we love each other so much that we feel threatened when there is another in the picture  Yet our 4 year relationship where we lived together for more than 3 years started in college when I was 19 and she was 18  I never really got to play the field sexually before her  but I know from reading through her old facebook messages  i know I creeped  shes had more sexual partners than I could count on one hand   This kind of makes me want to explore and enjoy my youth but I do love her and feel comfortable with the stability that she found with me  Its all sexual frustration on my part as I have even went to see an escort once and cried on the drive home   feeling like a piece of shit for doing it behind her back  I've hinted at swinging and shit by asking her to go to a sex club with me to which she asks what we would do there and I'd tell her  'I don't know  have sex in front of others ' and shes like 'Noo   I don't think I'd be comfortable with that ' and then yet she says another time  'If we were to have a threesome it would be with Margot Robbie ' and whenever I ask for a threesome with two girls she would ask for two guys but that me and him do shit together for which I shut down immediately  So I have tried to talk to her about it  I don't want to be a piece of shit  I do want to be with my now girlfriend  Its all a mess  I was alone during university  I got through it by spending my time studying and finding an internship   And well I sorta saw it as a sorta symbiotic thing like you help me and I try to help you get your life on track getting you to college and improving how you feel and maybe working out ur "dipping" stuff Dear lord  What kind of stuff have you tried  online  in bars clubs  I can't believe this is real  I refuse to  I don't want to  God no  the last thing I want is blood on my hands  just shooting someone would be scarring enough for my conscience  I might accidentally kill them if I shoot so are there any other options besides running and hiding   As a group of people who have every reason to be entirely negative  there's a surprisingly amount of positivity here when called for and posts rarely get ignored  I agree  I know "Forever Alone" exists as a kind of parody and people can joke about it but when I first came here and started reading it felt like a real community where people understand each other  I browse reddit using another account  this is sort of a more personal account  but I feel posting here really helps me ease some of my frustrations  I also got my first and ever reddit gold here in this sub  which was nice    He is a piece of shit for real  Yet  I know who he was before and I feel like I don't think he will change unless he gets help  which he won't seek  Thanks  learned something new today You replied a few times  I'm going to guess things froze up a bit  I wasn't saying he was suicidal about losing you  I really doubt it had anything to do with anyone else  Depression is an inner struggle  One of loneliness and pain  I know you're bothered by my comment  but I wasn't saying it to attack you  I'm trying to help you see his perspective  There are perfectly rational reasons for his actions  He was  and may still be  troubled by his own life  So reconciling with him may be the best option  But if you're unwilling to bow a knee for even a friend  and take the blame to say you're sorry  I don't suggest bothering him  He sounds like he has enough troubles as it is  He should have to feel like he needs to apologize any more than he already has  It will only drive him further into depression    Have a good life with your at least adequate looks  OP  you also have adequate looks   Your looks are not the problem  Hey  I wish you well  I have done the polypharmacy thing but I trusted my doctor  and my pharmacist  to keep me out of trouble  If I hadn't had trusted both of them  it would have been a terrifying experience  So     yeah  If you don't fully understand why you are on each and every drug and the reasoning behind those decisions and believe that your doctor has your safety in mind with ALL of your medications  including ones not prescribed by him her  then you need to re evaluate that relationship  Trust is huge  I know my pdoc pours over potential interactions with everything I take  Everything down to over the counter things like Tylenol that I might take on a fairly frequent basis because psych meds can have all kinds of strange interactions    Be safe  Happy New Year  Don't  try  to date people  Just hang out  make friends  have fun  do what you like  There's no way to know if you'll have chemistry with someone until you get to know them as friends first  As for texting  maybe get into some chat groups  They're a great way to meet people with common interests all around the world  and I know plenty of people who've found partners that way  my sis and her wife  for example   Good luck dude  If you were just overhearing them  how did you know the speaker was "a fat little pudgy girl "  Your story is full of holes Me too bro  now you know why I want to kill myself  Iv tried and tried and tried but now Iv given up beyond repair  Last night  again im not lying I swear  I had a dream that me and these 2 guys beat a person to death  it was like it was so real to the exact gory details  and I hid the body  I woke up crying at 7 32am to be exact This  I understand you love him OP but clearly he's not the person you thought he was  You are in love with a lie    Something to ask yourself is "Am I willing to go to jail for a lie " It isn't exactly the same as being talked over  What I meant to ask was do people really listen to and try to understand your talk  to see things from another perspective  good listeners do these   or do people just listen because they are waiting to talk again   I can say "lemme finish then blah blah" and the other person still won't 'listen'  Are you from us or uk  Can I please know   I'm conflicted myself with the issue of weed like I think it could get rid of my anxiety stress of Depression but that I shouldn't because it might mess me up and make me stupid The speaker was the girl who Interviewed me   I know it can feel really bad to have people make assumptions about your character based on the way you dress and I'm really sorry to hear that you have been judged like that   I think if I were you I'd consider if you are changing for others or for yourself and if you really want to change or if you're just momentarily hurt by something somebody said to you   If you really want to change how you are perceived maybe hang around some fashion subreddits and find a new style that you like and try it out     You may be right  but in the end it doesn't really matter  does it  You're still watching movies wishing you could be more like them  The only way out of the bind is to take it into your own hands  and learn from the experience  Instead of comparing people  analysing your odds  and figuring out your stats  watch yourself "do"  All the information you could possibly need to get where you need to go is right in front of you  in the moment  in the air between you and the people you talk to  Be aware  of yourself most of all  of your body and your intentions  and you'll see that there are probably a lot of things that happen that you weren't aware of  Some of them you were meaning to so  some of them not  When you're playing a game  you have to know what's happening before you can even have a chance of getting better  And then you just get better  It's hard initially  but it gets easier and easier   Your question is hopelessly vague  Learn to ask better questions  It's impossible to answer your question as you've asked it because it doesn't make any sense   This is startlingly rude  "Learn to ask better questions"   On a mental health sub  I'm new to the board and hope this isn't standard    He reminds me of Negan from The Walking Dead  I admire and thank you for your honesty   I'll surely consider it   However  we never really know what will happen do we   We don't know if a situation like this will ever arise again   But again  thank you  wat You're very welcome  I'm sorry you were feeling down lately  but I'm glad you were able to be cheered up  even just a little  Role playing probably people try to make it interesting that way It still is your decision  Are you illiterate  I try going to social events  gatherings and things but I don't feel I ever fit in  I'm not overly talkative nor do I have many stories to share  thanks to my mostly boring life  so I find myself struggling to relate to people  Plus after a while I just start to feel exhausted from trying to talk and socialise so I'll usually quietly try and slip away  Ok  People have different boundaries  Just because your willing to do something doesn't mean she has to be too  Maybe she's done something similar in the past and got burned so she doesn't do it any more  Uni can be the best time of your life  you just have to know how  Do you always try talking to new people you meet  If so  how are you approaching them and why doesnt it work out for you  Saying you just cant talk to people is too simple  Look deeper for problems and then examine why you fail  and then we can look for solutions  Why not just keep everything else the same  but stop smoking  When you throw everything in the air  why would you be surprised if you felt differently  A lot of healthy food can be not so gentle on the GI tract   I would feel awkward doing that  It also leads to people making fun of you  I've seen examples with other people trying that out  It sucks   Why do people complain about ugly people complaining   The phrase "ugly people complaining" does not apply to you  because you're not ugly  as evidenced by your pictures      If you git treated like subhuman garbage because of the way you looked  If you get treated like subhuman garbage  it's because you  act  like subhuman garbage   Your looks are completely average   Your personality is creepy and aggressive   Girls don't want to be around you because you make them uncomfortable with your personality  I'm sorry if I came across as though I was trying to make myself the victim  I was mostly just writing out what I was feeling because I had to get it out  He is most definitely the victim and I feel awful  I know there's nothing I can do to change what happened but I know I can do something to change myself and I am actively pursuing that  I agree  My concern is that some BPD pts get wrapped up in stigmatizing in such a way that it sort of supports a notion that they can rationalize    or even have a right to    their stress driven regressions and lashing out toward others who they  project  https   www google com webhp sourceid chrome instant ion 1 espv 2 ie UTF 8 safe off q projection psychology  as potential abusers  I went through a phase of that myself years ago and have seen it in other BPD  PPD and SZ pts many  many times   Do you two have a really blunt way of communication   If this is a recent thing that he's been doing  has he been under any stress  Changes in behaviour   Has he ever told you this in front of other people   Uni does give you much more opportunities to fill the void  If you find  a field that you truly enjoy  you can spend all your free time on it  One of the best ways to fight loneliness    Also  if you just do what you like  I'm sure you will find other people with the same interests   Making sure your house is really good protected so you won't need to worry about such stuff would be really convenient I believe    Or you can move out with friends which would be safer than being alone   You can have some pepper spray in your room near your bed where you can find in dark in case someone gets in  You can find a place in a neighborhood known for its safety    I want this every day  The return of those words is so lovely and fulfilling   Average means ugly your either attractive or your not  If you don't want the help of science  you get to live without it  There is nothing as effective as drugs for alleviating symptoms that are the root of your suffering   I'm an American citizen but I've lived in London and Oxford  so I am familiar with both cultures       No     He's not a pedophile that's committed to not acting on his urges  He has acted  Child porn is not a victimless crime  He has  directly  contributed to the abuse of children     He's not the "same man"  He's been lying to OP about who he is and quite possibly using her as a cover    sure it's important to be supportive of people with mental illnesses but once they have  decided to hurt someone  the time for professional help is gone   He has broken the law  multiple times  He has actively  soberly  chosen to help get children abused by adding onto the demand for CP  That's not someone who deserves to hear "I'm so sorry for you  let's get through this together" that's someone who deserves to hear their fucking Miranda rights being read to them  There's no easy way to break the news to your family  I guess because you might be afraid of how they would react  There's also probably the part where half of you wants to get help  but the other half is afraid to do so  and clings to the disorder   It sounds like your step mother is concerned  and from her past experience  may worry for your health and safety  If you're not comfortable sharing with her  maybe an appointment with a different medical professional might help   I believe the first step is realising that you have a problem  and accepting that you need help  You may not feel like you need or want help the next day  but write it down and make an appointment and keep to it    It's absolute torture  I've been through it  and bingeing still haunts me  I'm lucky because my family has grown to be supportive  even if in the beginning everything was calamity    You've realized how much it hurts you  that's good  Sometimes our minds and the disorder is too strong however  It's hard to do this alone  and I truly hope you get support and help   I believe your step mother wouldn't respond with any 'I told you so's  especially since she's been through it and she must know how much you hurt   Her comments might rub you the wrong way  but sometimes people don't know how to word things  My mother has always been concerned and caring  but for years she's always said the wrong things that only caused distress and hurt  I think that by sharing this with your step mother  it might bring the both of you closer   Don't struggle alone  please  Don't let it ruin your life further    Seeking help is incredibly difficult  and your frustration is understandable  Telling someone isn't a sign of weakness  This illness isn't a sign of weakness  Please don't be afraid  I can't talk to people and be interesting  Be normie  make people be friends with me etc  How is that too simple  Yes  Get lots of rest  drink lots of fluids  and wait about a week   She's probably projecting  because it makes her feel like she's not alone  I know I used to do this  and sometimes I still do  Does she go to group therapy  That might help her  Volunteering at an animal shelter or food kitchen or something along those lines might be good too  it'd help her feel in control and like she's doing something good with her time   You definitely need to focus on your own happiness  If that doesn't include her  then that's the way it's gotta be  I hope you both find what's right for you  I'm undecided and have no interests besides playing video games  Friends don't just happen for people like me  I have seen schizophrenic and psychotic bipolar pts on as many as 14   He has actively chosen to contribute to  fucking child abuse  this isn't a meth addiction where he's only harming himself  He  Is  Harming  Children   What if OP could save those children by turning him into the police  They could track down where the photos came from  But the route  you  want her to take completely disregards the children  And for what  Love  Fuck that  You're prioritizing feelings over lives   Nobody on such shows can ever be described as a 'normie'  I'd say this is a case of money not being as important as her welfare  and that it would be a good idea to keep seeking professional help that she is happy with  that's my opinion  Life is hard and circumstances can overwhelm and make you forget what is important  I'd say get her to find a new hobby or some kind of outlet  even charity work  Helping others can make you feel good about yourself and rediscover the vitality for life you might lack  Meditation is another thing I suggest to everyone as I feel that that was what transformed my life for the better and can help a lot with anxiety  It reduced my panic attacks a lot   But sorting out her career so she's got something to be optimistic about and look forward to will take a big burden off her shoulders  I feel like perhaps she may be someone who places a lot of expectations on herself and when life has been tough to her  it has discouraged her and knocked her self esteem somewhat  Would you say that sounds right at all  I just say this as a masters in biology sounds very demanding and to get to the end of that and find disappointment can be shattering  But the disappointment is a direct result of expecting a great job at the end of it  But if you can be content with less in life you will worry yourself a lot less  and I think she needs to relax and try and concentrate on something productive to stay in a positive mindset  I'm no expert but this is just my advice I hope I helped in the slightest  good luck I wish her well People generally assume I'm content because that's what I show them   I have never been diagnosed with anything but I have seen professionals in the past  in high school  mostly because I was self harming and having bad mood swings   I am suspecting something may be wrong with me though since I have been having what I assume are panic attacks when I'm sober  uncontrollable crying  hyperventilating  heart racing  shaking  and I have been feeling kind of stressed for just the smallest things   And I will do exactly what you've recommended  Tonight when we talk  I'll make it clear to him that I'm the one who did him wrong and that we can take a break for as long as he needs it  I'll make it known that I'm doing everything I can to be a better person and I'll tell him I love him no matter what happens   You give really good advice  thank you again  I do not know whether it helps or not  but I quited masturbaition nearly a year ago  but emotionally I am a lot worse off  not because I stopped  it is unrelated to that   So I just want to say that contrary to expectations  abstaining from masturbation will not solve your problems at once  Maybe if you try to become less socially awkward at first  and use that to quit fapping  or simply if you think of quitting masturbation not as the cause of positive changes  but as an effect of changing your mentality  your attitude  that helps also   Maybe I am just rambling  but this is what came to my mind  Rap R B If one was invalidated

"massage" the brain so that it responds more quickly to psychotherapy  Perhaps your partner is just getting early onset Alzheimer's  Perhaps you married them because it's your job to do those things in a loving marriage  Perhaps you are just questioning why you got married  and this is why divorce happens  because you begin to question why you get annoyed   Maybe you should just wear clothes with more sheep material in it  Or you could just hate monogamy and prefer to explore more than just one which is another reason you should not have gotten married  I'm feeling better than I was this morning  Sadness for me is never something explosive  it's such a slow burn  I've never cried over any of this  but it'd probably better than the weight in my gut  and feeling sad every time I'm reminded of something that we enjoyed together  or something I did wrong    I should get on the exercise I think  I always feel good after doing anything  it's usually DIY as a get a pretty good workout luugging barrels of beer around all day at work  But I did draw up a body weight fitness thing once  I think I'll get back on it  I also want to carry on learning Polish  but I'd like to do more things that aren't sat in front of my computer  I might try exercising whenever I feel low  normally I'm okay  especially if I have something to be doing  but it might just give me that short term lift I need when things feel at their worst   That place is fantastic  It's honestly been slowly lifting my spirits ever since I subbed    Thanks for reading and responding  it means a lot mate   See what I mean   People are mean to you because you are mean to others   You can't expect anyone who sympathize with you when you're so hostile   Get mental health  or kill yourself   Your problems are all about behavior  nothing about looks  Yeah now that I think of it pepper spray is pretty good or a taser  do you by any chance know if stun guns or rubber bullets are allowed in civilian use  The thing is  I'm not addicted to alcohol  I never drink unless I'm at a party or having the occasional wine with dinner  I think there's a deeper underlying issue that arises when I drink so I'm going to seek therapy to find out what that is and I'm probably just never going to drink again since I honestly really don't even like drinking  It has always been just a thing I do socially  How they sposed to know you want em if u don't flirt wit em  Sheep  They're attractive Please die of unimaginable insufferable Ebola  And I'm sure there are exactly as many saying 'me and my mom' or 'me and my sister' or 'me and my friend'  you just notice the girlfriend ones more because you ain't got one  Go to a women's shelter  take the cat to a shelter ad on craigslist  If you're religious  seek help at a church temple mosque etc  If you don't already have one  get any job and save your money  Shelters  goodwill  and the Salvation Army all  from what I understand  help people in your position  Definitely look into section 8 housing  as long as you can prove employment you should be good to rent  Best luck  Stay safe  Sad that you get downvoted for having preferences  Edit wasn't looking to alter advice  I was just trying to be as clear as I can be  Thank you for your advice  People often accuse you of what they are guilty of  Not always  but I find it's pretty common with manipulation and abuse  Coming from someone who went through abuse of their own  it will get easier to stand up for yourself  Have a relationship with your dad and sister  That doesn't mean you need one with your mom  You are worthy of love  care  and compassion  Other people can take the maternal figure in your life    Sending love   I'm an incel and I'm very high in society  I'm beautiful  smart and talented  Just cause I can't get dick doesn't mean I'm worthless XD  Same here  always thought hating on these people is pointless  but that's besides the point   Realistically you should talk to him  Bash it out  Perhaps you should ease into the conversation  that way it won't be as heated hopefully  Just remember he's still the person you love  and even though this is a terrible situation I'm sure you'll make it though   After scrolong through the other comments I do mind kind of agree with calling the police if you feel threatened however  Staying safe should be the most important thing  Here's a non

suggested there  I would have a look at Gershen Kaufman's and Silvan Tompkin's work on shame   I think that there are a few things to consider here  some of which may be of the utmost seriousness   To begin  this obviously a matter not to be taken lightly  so sentimentalities on the matter should be avoided  and all issues should be discussed clearly  openly  and sincerely  I am not offering professional advise or insight by any means  but am instead simply expressing my own personal opinion based on experience    It seems to me therefore that something to seriously consider is public safety  More specifically  the quite literal safety of children  But before I move on to the specifics  I think there are a few relevant points to consider which few people are likely to accept as facts  but which may be of significant importance  This should be blatantly obvious since there are quite a few people claiming that the children in the pictures were beings abused  when in fact OP clearly specified that they were pictures which seem to have been taken at public places with the exception of the one which was last to be mentioned  Therefore  much of the so called "advice" on this thread are emotional exaggerations   The first thing to recognize is that many "pedophiles" do not have actual sexual desires  Actually  the word pedophile in itself makes this obvious  since the word  phile  or  Philo  may mean love  and the word  pedo  relates to children or youth  Therefore  some  emphasis on the word some  people called people "pedophiles" actually feel a non sexual type of affection for children which may become  confused  for sexual attraction  without any  actual sexual desires simply because they do not know how to interpret their own feelings  Hence why there are many cases in which some pedophiles claim that they "would never hurt children"  Because they have no actual desire to do so  but instead  think  that they like children   The reason why some people  called pedophiles   think  that they like children is actually quite interesting  Note that I am not describing those who actually hurt children  but those who feel allured by the sight of children  Those are two very different perspectives  To be allured by something  and to want to hurt something are two very different type of feelings   Pedophiles may often be people who  feel  that they did not have childhoods  Actually  it is a rather well known fact that many pedophiles were raped as children  Therefore  to ardently hate all pedophiles without discernment or discrimination is quite ridiculous  since many of them were victims as children  It may be said that later on as adults they become victims of their victimhood   Therefore  some people  including those who claim who to have never had a childhood  usually feel allured by the sight of children because they seem innocent  Since people  always  desire what they what they feel they do not have   Pedophiles may see children as perfectly innocent  which then sets up a very extreme irrational form of contrast  Since pedophiles set up children on such high pedestals in regards to innocence  they may feel very low in comparison  very guilty or "dirty"  Because of that feeling of guilt  paedophiles might often perform acts of self harm do self hate or shame  and some may eventually act out on the persona of a "dirty" or "evil" person which they  think  or  feel  that they are when comparing themselves to children which they may see as perfectly pure  Note again  that I am not referring to people who hurt children  but people who feel allured by  or who claim to admire the sight of children   The second factor to consider is the illegality of the matter  and this is of significant importance    The facts are that if you take those pictures to a police department  not only will he likely be sentenced to imprisonment but will most likely live in pretty unfavorable circumstances even by prison standards  The facts are that people in prisons do not care about what he may have or may not have done  and may go out of their way to quite literally torture  or even rape him  This is why any decision that you make should not be taken lightly   It may be of some use to consider the fact that as you said  you yourself were a meth user  I personally hold no judgments against meth users  but we should all be able to recognize the fact that people who use meth are not only looked down upon by many people but also criticized and judged almost systematically  Therefore  you should be able to recognize the fact that the common opinion doesn't always tell the full story so to speak  The popular notion of meth users says very little about your personal experience and feelings which caused you to use meth  At the same time  you may be able to appreciate the mercy which many people may have shown you by not involving law enforcement when you were doing something obviously illegal   Now  I am not at all suggesting that you  not  inform a police department  and neither am I suggesting that you should because of the following reasons   One the one hand  we should consider the very serious  possibility   not necessarily a  probability   that he may someday hurt a small child  I am not saying that he ever will  but I am suggesting that such a risk should be seriously considered  In my opinion  if we were to  know  for a fact that he has such a desire  then I would suggest that you inform a police department immediately  In my opinion  it is not only yours but every person's responsibility to inform law enforcement of any serious possible threat or danger to the safety of children   The reason I do not feel comfortable advising you with a full conviction on way or the other is because of what actually happened and what is  likely  to happen if he is sent to prison  To begin  I think we can all agree that the pictures are not the sign of a healthy individual  However  based on what you described  they are also not pictures of child abuse  If they were  then I would suggest that you advise a police department immediately  However  they seem to have the type of pictures most parents have of their children  I know some parents keep pictures of their own children bathing  among with all sorts of pictures which they might rather openly display to the child's husband or wife when they are older  So the content of the pictures  suggest  or  implies  that your boyfriend is not psychologically healthy  However  based on the information which you described  I think that most people would be unfazed by the content of the pictures in an  appropriate circumstance   It is not difficult to imagine a parent showing a friend pictures of their child's gymnastic performance  or showing their  30 year old son's picture as 5 year old on the toilet to his 30 year old wife while he is in the same room  Therefore  I think that the content of the pictures needs to be set into perspective   At the same time  if you report him to a police official  he will likely go to prison  he will suffer  and his life may be permanently ruined  All because of a few pictures  without having hurt anyone  Actually  if you think about the facts  that abused children can grow to become pedophiles  he might have been abused as child  Do you know what his childhood was actually like   I feel that most people are likely to overlook some sort of fact or possibility in the crafting of their personal convictions  I however  advise you to follow your own intuition on the matter  If you report him  his life will most likely be ruined and he will suffer  even though he may have hurt no one and may have helped you at times  If you do not report him  then he might someday hurt a small child    Therefore  it is all up to you  how well you know him  and what you feel is the right thing to do  I personally feel that no one can fault you for choosing to do the right thing   this comment made me and my girlfriend laugh a lot thanks for the reply  I do like these kind of conversations but I feel as though nobody my age is really can relate to that and thinks you are weird if you take a conversation beyond witty humour  which is fine if you are good at it and since I would definitely not consider myself as very good at it  I get bored by it quite quickly  I am into some instrumental   This  https   www youtube com watch v U gRg piz M  is one of my favourite tracks  Besides that  some rap too  Childish Gambino and Kendrick Lamar are pretty awesome  It sounds like someone drugged your drink  to be honest  Maybe they thought it was someone else's  Or maybe it was just a unexplainable bad reaction to alcohol  who knows    Still  I would not touch any booze at all from this point on to repair the relationship  Let her tell you when it's okay to drink again   I don't think so but I have no idea    in my country you get away with raping because you attended to the trial in a suit and the woman you raped was wearing a dress when you raped her    I should wear more clothes with sheep oil in them  What does that even mean   Me  Having been there  I can suggest the following  because they all worked for me     1  If you're taking drugs of any kind  including alcohol   take yourself to a detox and get off of them with expert help    This  kind of depression is actually chronic  cyclical  feedback looping over stimulation and  withdrawal  https   www google com webhp sourceid chrome instant ion 1 espv 2 ie UTF 8 safe off q drug withdrawal psychology    Or

their website before making any further decisions   You'll find you are not only not alone  but that thousands of other people have found their way out of the "soup" in ACA    3  If you  stressed

healthy food and appropriate medications and supplements  not always including anti depressants  btw  offer good possibilities   4  Be careful with anti D meds  If one is depressed as the result of

If you have  thought  https   www google com webhp sourceid chrome instant ion 1 espv 2 ie UTF 8 safe off q cognitive distortions  your way into depression with shame  guilt  worry  remorse  regret

in  thanks for the input though  appreciate it They have cue cards and people letting them know when to clap and make noises   Source  mother went to see it   I guess this makes sense  Thank you   They have cue cards and people letting them know when to clap and make noises   Source  mother went to see it   If there's more than one writer  there's going to be collaboration  No way around it  If you want your story to be untainted you need to work alone  video game and anime soundtracks mostly  Hi buddy  we've all been there  all for different reasons  but we all know that feeling   Forget trying to figure it out or wonder what's going through her head  or whether you did something wrong  you won't make any sense of it  and you'll likely imagine the worst and create your own imaginary enemy   I'm in a place at the moment where I'm getting too much of my self worth from what people think of me after losing a girl and a previous abusive relationship  I didn't need that before  and I'll get back there eventually    How are you for hobbies  Freinds  Job  I've always gotten most of my sense of worth from those things  Not only do they take your mind off it  but it's something you're doing for yourself  things you build and create that demonstrate your worth to yourself  Exercise is also supposed to be great for it    I'll be honest I'm not much good when it comes to emotional support and such  I never know what to say  Just know that there's plenty of people out there who do really care about you  and would be devistated if you jumped in front of that train  even in such an elegant manner    It hurts  It'll hurt less after a while  and soon after that  you'll be in a more emotionally secure position where it won't hurt like that again  and you will fret less    Love you bud  and for the love of god  see the sidebar if you're actually contemplating suicide  Even at your darkest  life has hope and potential  You could work it out with her  you could meet someone else  you will grow and flourish as a person  none of that will ever happen if you cut it off based on something that I promise you will forget about in a few years   Even if the handsomest guy in the world told me all the things you're saying  most girls would still reject him    Don't you see   Your personality is such shit that even if you were a 10 10 looks wise  nobody would want you   Please get help   Your family and friends must be so sick of your shit at this point   Forget about women for a minute  and think of your loved ones   They must feel so awful when they hear and see you being so shitty   If you won't get help for your own sake  do it for your loved ones' sake  I cant do the work for you  Look deep into how conversations between you and strangers go and compare that to other people who have success  From there you can work on your social skills  There is no magic trick to it  just trial and error  Take risks and you may get rewards  Thank you for sharing  I guess you are right  So try focusing on one thing first   Pretty much everything besides country  Nowadays if I like a song  I just like it  HipHop Rap  Death Metal Metalcore  Indie Classic Rock  Vaporwave Retrowave  even a bit of pop  I do prefer songs lyrics that are sad and depressing though  like I actively seek shit like that out  If one person you tell decides that you're less worthy of being their friend  and one person supports you and helps you recover and makes those accommodations that you need  it's an overall win  If you tell no one  your friend's attitude is actually still the same  they just don't know the truth  But you won't get the support so you do yourself out of something really worthwhile that could help end the cycle of anxiety  It definitely wasn't drugs  we only had people round that we new well personally and trusted  Must've been an unexplainable reaction to alcohol like you said  That was like reading my own thoughts  Well put OP  I feel you on that  Especially the idea of being dependent only on me and not having to meet others expectations  I do not feel unfulfilled single  Kinda annoying that very few people understand this though  People tend to think there is some unspoken and dark reason why I am not interested in a relationship  but it is pretty damn simple  I know sometimes it feels like it damages ur morality makes you feel bad but if you try to improve yourself while still doing that it keeps you happy until you can one day be happy enough to stop doing it and be happy on your own Because you spoke of "overthinking" and "analysis paralysis " I suspect that what I posted on the thread "Someone help" on this sub reddit will be germane for you    With respect to meds  obsessional thinkers very often do better with low dose levels of  anti psychotics  https   www google com webhp sourceid chrome instant ion 1 espv 2 ie UTF 8 q neuroleptic 20medications   but it looks to me like many prescribers are not yet up to speed on that  and are still going with  supposedly  anxiolytic anti Ds like citalopram and escitalopram   benzodiazepines like clonazepam and lorazepam  That's too bad  because fractional dose quetiapine and lurazidone appear to work pretty well in such cases  and with minimal sfx  I'm glad if I could show you other ways to protect yourslef than killing    I've always found older women incredibly alluring  Not sure why  Maybe it has something to do with me being a submissive little bitch  Great  Even a criminal is seen as a better partner than me  I don't fuckin know  You want me to look at my conversations with a microscope and determine scientifically the keywords and phrases I am missing  I don't think that's how you learn  Sadistic  I'd ask you to explain but I'm still trying to figure out what sheep oil is  You say things that don't make sense  You also assume my partner is female  I will not fray  Whatever that means   There are definitely way more references to girlfriends and SO's on reddit than other family members or friends   I'm really sorry you're going through all that  While I'm not trans  and definitely can't understand everything you're going through  I know what it's like to hate your body and feel like you're unacceptable because of it  I went through years of hating my appearance  and myself because of it   and I still have bad days  but overall  things have gotten a lot better  They almost certainly will for you  too  you'll keep doing what you can to make yourself look the way you want to  but more important than that  you'll come to terms with how you look now  I've heard that even when physical changes are positive  which it sounds like those caused by hormones are for you    they're hard to adjust to and deal with  because we're creatures of habit and change is hard  Give it time  Allow yourself to adjust to your changing appearance    You sound like a super sweet person with a lot to contribute to the world  The fact that one of your reasons for sticking around is to spread happiness to others is frankly awesome  and I admire you for it  Your unwillingness to hate even those who hurt you is very mature  and I hope that you'll learn to extend that kindness to yourself  Good luck    do need to be near in hdtv  That does not make sense in English     I can tell you that everything is blurred due to upscaling   Your PS2 outputs standard def video  480i if using yellow white red plugs   the TV then tries to blow that up to 1080p  usually with poor results     There was a component video cable for PS2  red green blue white red  which can produce better results   Some PS2 games can use 480p output if you hold triangle and x while the game loads     You might be able to play with your HDTV's image settings to get it to more sharply define edges while scaling   That will help with the text     Finally there's a device called a scan converter which you can put between PS2 and HDTV and it does the upscaling in a much more game friendly manner   This is sort of a niche product tho    "omg guys look at my girlfriend she did this cool thing isn't she amazing   hey did i mention i have a girlfriend  "    Basically every mainstream reddit thread   Your partner might have neurological issues  Have they ever been tested  Okay You're the one who created sheep oil  I'm kind of lost  Keep doing until I reach a point where I'm emotionally healthy enough to quit  Although I have not been through exactly the same situation  I have been in the position of having to let go of someone I love for their own good    The fact that people are asking you to seek further "adult" advice is completely bizarre to me  considering this is not a trivial matter    You need to contact the police   You need to come to terms with the fact that although he has helped you through very difficult times  this is not something that can simply be pushed under the rug   If you truly love him  you will call the police   not for you but for him  He needs this   You will be fine  life will go on  and with the support of friends and family  you'll be able to move forward from this    Best of luck   Thank you for the warm and friendly wishes of caring support  It really does me so much to hear these things  I prefer music that doesn't distract me from my thoughts  Video game soundtracks  smooth instrumental jazz  and classical music make up the lion's share of my music player  What else do you want to do  There are only two options go out  talk with people and likely fail or stay in your room in safety but alone    Do some reading into how to socialize and then use those tips even if it seems weird to you  With time you will know what to say and what to do  Thats learning  While I obviously don't know the details of your situation  you sound like a good friend  You helped this person as best you could for a child so young  and I admire you for that   my brain has adapted to

your age  Im 26 now   You are still young  and there is still so much that you can achieve  The fact that you wrote this post shows that you want to change  It sucks that these things happened to you  but you cant let those things define you as a person  If you really want to change  give yourself some time to really think about what you want to achieve  university  a job  gym etc  and then just work on that as hard as you can until you get to a point in your life where ur a bit happier than you are now  As for social things  you cant really control those  Just know that new people come into

advice it means alot  Years stuck in this situation take their toll There is no physical abuse but the  emotional causes a scary complacency   I used to be pretty resourceful and just have to quickly find that person again for my kids  I went to school last year already suffering from depression and long time girlfriend cheated on me right when i got there  Was in the tank that year  Last semester was the final straw for the school so i got kicked out because of grades  At the time it was chemistry but before i left i changed it to history  I want to teach and help kids  However my mother and step father think i should be an elementary school teacher  So stuck at home and going to the local community college till i can go to another school  Also just feel empty from the loneliness and constant failures of SO searching  I try doing just me but ends up just being really lonely  First  I wouldn't go by one person's perception   Frankly  she might simply be cowed by your size   Some

gentleman by some other women  edit  right off the bat  I always dress the same   Ask some other people besides this woman before you decide whether changing your look is a thing   Because some people just get upset over things that most others don't  things in their past lives  maybe  who knows   Baggage  anyway    Ah that makes a difference    It's proper etiquette to suspend judgment towards

knew well and trusted  One of my best friends had a guy she had known for three years  a guy she trusted completely  a guy who had met her parents  drug her drink and rape her while she was blacked out  The next morning he   completely sincerely   denied that it was rape and said that he just wanted her to "loosen up" and that she had consented     Maybe because you're a guy  you don't see this as a possibility  Maybe you do know better than I do  But as cynical and as shitty as it is  I think you should not dismiss the possibility that you drank something that was intended for someone else

Anyone can make friends my dude  especially in college  I will have to say that the way you dress and carry yourself can be way more important to get to know people  So if you want something that

 If you're just a slow learner you'll get there eventually   Just focus on improving things one at a time until you're ready to begin quitting I'm trying the same Well I've been doing that my whole life    and this post here is the result lol  And about texting  I am in different chat groups on discord and stuff like that and I talk there with no problem  I'm used to randomly talking with people on the internet  but the thing is    people that come on chat groups are usually there to talk to they respond fast and try to make conversation  They don't take as much time to answer as someone who's doing god knows what and responding to a message when they have time   How old are you I used to wonder what kind of weirdos did that  Now I totally get it  they do it to  stay married   A good night's sleep is just too important  I truly don't know what you're going through and can only imagine how hurt you must be  Please know there is someone out here praying for you to find peace in this relationship   It was a trick he taught me   Okay  not too bad then   A couple things to keep in perspective     Your friend very likely could have been very busy  There's no reason to doubt that  Christmas is a bit of a hectic time  followed right after by new years  Lots of people travel or have commitments during that time  That being said  a quick response is not too much to ask for  It doesn't have to be prompt  He doesn't have to send you a response within an hour  But nothing within 2 weeks is a bit much  especially for you as someone who is trying to put themselves out on the line where you haven't in the past  This kind of lines up with my story I mentioned about my friend who wouldn't respond  It's okay if you're busy or you just don't want to do anything  but give me  some  response within a reasonable time frame  It could be that he was busy  didn't see it for a few hours  then by the time he saw it he figured it was too late and so he just ignored it  But going forward  you would appreciate a quick  "Hey  sorry  I've been caught up in something for the past few hours  Not gonna be able to hang today "    Your last sentence "If that's how it is  then they don't have the right to expect different from you " That's a very careful edge to walk on  In a relationship you should never tell someone what they can or cannot do  You can say  "From my perspective  it just irks me that you ask me to reach out  and now that I reach out you do the same thing as I was  If I'm going to reach out more  then I need you to reciprocate " You can say things from your perspective  but any time you word a message in a "you don't have the right to   " phrasing then that's too demanding and will rub people the wrong way  Whenever you confront someone  no one can get mad at you for how you feel or how you perceive things  But they can get mad when you tell them concretely how things are or what they should shouldn't do  Most often these types of things are simple miscommunications or disconnects that can be fixed  and there was never any ill intent  So telling someone "you don't have the right   " without first informing them of the problem and expressing how it makes you feel doesn't give them a chance to fix it  That being said  you can get the same message to them  but just keep it focused on "I" statements  Talk about what it looks like from your perspective and how it makes you feel  then you two can figure out an agreeable solution   Confrontation is a very healthy thing to do  but it's also very delicate since wording something the wrong way or taking something the wrong way can lead to an argument instead of problem solving  If one was invalidated  insulted  rejected  disclaimed  criticized  judged  blamed  embarrassed  humiliated

Wasn't aware he's putting children in danger by looking at photos he could find online  minus the nudes   It's not like he's out raping and molesting them  She should seek mental help first for him  if by chance he is out actually harming children then yes  go with what you said  Tarnishing his name and ruining his life completely because he has a mental problem isn't worth it  I would like to say I'm comfortable being single  but when I see a loving couple I can't help but feel envious  I was pretty insecure growing up  but every day I'm becoming more comfortable with myself  In the back of my mind I do feel a bit unloveable so that doesn't help anything  Here's to 2017  may we continue our personal growth  Pretty much only metal  I try to avoid love songs like the plague  Well stop fucking drinking then   Thanks for that  it sounds eerily familiar  She did have a bout of postpartum depression and a lot of our misundestandings stem from me not being able to read her mind  I'm naturally easy going and accept a lot for what it is  She sees problems and looks for a cause  Most of the time she can trace it back to me somehow  For example she was driving us all home one night and missed an exit  If I missed an exit  I leave it as I missed an exit  She asks me "and what were you doing" as if I was supposed to remind her  I had actually fallen asleep  which she didn't like either  Btw I didn't end up going snowboarding today  There really isn't much left to do around the house as I cleaned vacuumed and mopped over the weekend  but now I'm trying to read her mind as to what else she could have possibly wanted me to do around the house  I didn't enjoy the idea of spending the day at the mountain dreading what I have to come home to if there were anything to be done  Yeah but do you intentionally and obviously flirt with them  Yeah  I guess we're both kinda blunt  I am  when I do communicate  but I don't fare well with serious conversations because I start crying and then can't get my points across very well    This has been a thing for the past 2 years at least  I can't remember farther back  but there's nothing crazy going on or anything  Also  he waits till we're alone   That's pretty impressive you should be screaming that  Congrats   I feel like had I been acting in a way that might indicate being drugged  the paramedics would have noticed the signs  They were there for a very long time  So that's what Godwin's Law looks like  Neat   As long as the dude ain't out taking the pictures videos himself and ain't put trying to get laid with a preteen then I say let him do his thing  you do yours  There's way worse people out there than him  Even if I didn't have a problem with people masturbating to images of children and young teenagers  which I happen to think is really fucked up and I do have a problem with   the biggest problem is that watching these videos and looking at these pictures 1  victimizes exploits children  2  puts children at great risk 3  potentially turns a pervert into a rapist   The only thing we know about this guy is that he has child pornography on his phone  We have no idea what else he may have done  How do you know he hasn't taken any nude suggestive photos of children  How do you know he hasn't molested or raped a child  Many child molesters have ruined countless number of kids' lives and continued to do so again and again  because no one said anything  Jerry Sandusky for one    I'm not saying that he's a rapist  But I do think that handling this one on one is a terrible idea  Does he feel secure in his own masculinity  Sounds like a little bit of Walter White syndrome mixed with feelings of inferiority  As dumb as it may sound  teaching isn't always seen as a masculine profession  Do you make more money than him  The thing is if you do something without ppl asking unfortunately its not obligated to say thank you  Most ppl with manners will but never expect anything at all for a good deed  The thing is you dont do good deads expecting anything  not even a thank you  Im a nice person but i learned long ago truly never expect anything in return  So  from what you describe  I'm not sure sure this guy is a bully  He sounds more like a yuk yuk buddy who just doesn't know when to stop  Could be totally wrong about that   At any rate  I would suggest talking to him when you are on on one  Tell him the tit for tat thing was fun and all  but you're starting to hear co workers talking about it  and if word gets back to management it could suck for both of you   Because they stay inside and are bad at socializing and meeting other people   It's by no means impossible or even hard  But probably harder than usual to become friends with them because of the things I mentioned before  I met my wife when we were in our late teens and I told her when I was attracted to other girls  which was always back then  We've been together for 32 years  have three kids  and are both very happy with our relationship  She is still working on getting me to not "overshare" my thoughts with her  I don't think that you should break up with him  it may last and be beautiful  He's been honest and open with you  No teenager you ever meet won't feel attractions  The important thing is to be sure that the one you're with doesn't act on those attractions  If he has some self control and you are important enough to him  he won't  I didn't  I wasn't able to afford a house until I was 30  And even then I had to move from the Bay Area to Sacramento AND have help with my down payment    Don't give up  Home ownership at 24 is a pipe dream on one income but doable in a few years   We exist but in the real world we are few and far between   The only reason it seems like there are a lot of us is because we flock to this sub  n m I forgot you guys are still in school   Me too  I mean seeing them have no interest in me  literally none of them  made me kinda feel like that   "why should I be interested in a kind that is not interested in me"  I just look at them and feel nothing   Dude   Print out what you wrote and say basically that  Everything you said is straight up the truth and loaded with nothing but care and concern for your boyfriend and his happiness   He switched to biochem and you supported him  He's not doing too hot right now  and these are still the foundation courses for the major  You just want him to be successful and in a major he enjoys  Ask if he truly wants to do this or if he would want to reconsider being a teacher again   I'd probably lead into the conversation by asking how he feels about the upcoming semester  Hopefully he'll be open about his concerns  I hope that after failing two more courses he's nervous or uneasy about it  and that can be a good platform to ask him if this is truly the right path  Ask if he really wants to go this way  or if he would be happier going the teaching route  You'll support him no matter what  but you see how much stress this is putting on him  the struggles he's going through  and the results  It's a fair question to ask if biochem just isn't a good fit and if teaching  or something else   would be a better fit   Ideally he should be able to take a step back from all of this and examine where his strengths are  and what he likes about this major  as well as where his weaknesses are and what he dislikes about this major  Since it hasn't been working out  let's take the things he likes and his strengths and find a major that fits better  It might be teaching  or it could be something else  Yes  it sucks to have to take a step back  but it's better to admit now that this is the wrong course for him versus waiting another semester or two and then changing  The longer he stays on the wrong path  the more backtracking he has to do   What is done with it should be MY decision   It still is  that's why your getting downvoted and insulted so much  You're intentionally being an idiot  Wow  so your advice is to not even prep them   I mean  they probably know  but what if they don't    My advice is to casually say "you know I'm gay  right   I want to bring someone over"   Hell if I know  I'm bad at meeting people  I agree  These thick minded humans obviously don't though  If he goes to prison over a few photos he'll come out completely changed  for the worst  if of course  he makes it out of there  It's better to get help and therapy for him than ruin his life  tarnish his name  and possibly get him killed   right  Now that being said  if the dude does have sexual adventures with kids then I do believe the cops should be certainly notified but he's not hurting anyone by viewing the photos  most you could literally get from google with a quick one word search  Turn 18 in less than 10 days  It's a general question  it's really not that hard to answer  as you have began to do  I didn't want to make it too specific to myself  I wanted to keep it general so that many people could benefit  Uhm  happy new years though    I guess I can try that  Thank you   That subs as depressing as it is  Feel like I got screwed over badly  Yeah Not being able to have kids sounds appealing to people who can't be bothered with children and not being a supermodel means you wouldn't be jetting off all over the world  Pedophiles    Childlovers   Both two different terms  both two different definitions  The dude is hurting 0 children mentally and physically viewing photos  it's the sick bastards that take them photos   That being said  we don't know the full story  Maybe he took the photos himself but who really knows  I highly doubt he took them  No ties and the worlds your oyster  go get um  You guys just communicate affection differently  Unfortunately that means things are always going to feel unequal  Your guy might feel like he  is  putting in a lot of effort being affectionate  because in his eyes he is  Keep an eye out  he might be doing tiny subtle things for you but is too reserved to point them out to you   Don't feel ashamed about anything  keep being yourself  Has he explicitly said he dislikes the things you do  If he hasn't I'm betting he likes it  Maybe try telling him something like this  "I've been feeling insecure about our relationship lately  When I show you affection how much I love you  it doesn't seem like you reciprocate in the same way  I need to know that you care as much for me as I care about you  is there any way you could be more vocal physical to show me that you do " Hope everything works out for ya  You must have just started dating I don't live anywhere near my parents anymore so they don't know much  My 13 y o sister said I must be hiding a girlfriend from her and my parents seem to think the same or that I am kind of a chad  Makes me feel even worse    Do you know that they were of many different families types  I wouldnt imagine they would be but on 14 of a similar type    As for my currect situation  I'm on 20 abilify  150 effexor and 300 wellbutrin  My doc is hesitant to put me on anything else  THere has been some success  but it has been limited  which is why I want to add something  That guy doesn't even look that attractive to me  I'm really puzzled by his case  But good for him I guess  be a dishwasher But would he is the question They need to sit down and have an honest talk about it  Some "pedophiles" wouldn't go as far as touching a child  most just view  Locking up someone like him is a waste of tax dollars and space  we need the producers and distributors locked up  look  I agree  but he needs help and that's where the focus should be at the moment  don't forget that there's also a reason why prison has a high rate of recidivism  if he can change through therapy  that'll be great  but prison shouldn't be the first option  imo  I'm sure I'm not the only person who's heard of innocent people doing time only to become criminals afterwards   I'm assuming he's not listed on your birth certificate      Could you ask any aunts or uncles  your brothers dad  or any old friends of your moms  I'm 25 and for me  I want a younger GF  Mainly because I believe girls from 18 25 are the most attractive they will ever be  I'd even consider a 16 year old  that's legal here  but I think I would probably find her too immature  That's not to say women older than that are not attractive  they're just not as nice as they are during that 18 25 age bracket    I feel like no matter what age a girl is  it'll be hard for her to relate to me  I feel older women expect certain things that I can't deliver  They expect a certain level of maturity  career progression and life experiences that I don't have  People at my age begin to start settling down    For me younger girls are more beautiful  There is always a feeling that these girls can have anyone they want  So if I somehow end up with them then you have really achieved something  Also I missed out on being a teenager  I feel if I could have a teen GF I could somehow be part of that world and sort of experience it     These girls judge you on your age too though and I know they would view me similar to the older woman  although maybe not as harshly as they may not be looking for something as serious  I sometimes read stuff on AskReddit and I don't really know what people are talking about  It makes me realise that I probably wouldn't be able to relate to these younger girls If I was on a date with one  But then I guess I can't relate to many people outside of this sub   Most FA's like me don't even know what flirting really is or how to do it  I never even approached a girl so maybe that's why        "Uh    My boyfriend is gay " Yeah  lets escalate it to the extreme  If she really cared about him  or at least wanted to help the guy out without ruining his whole life  she'd seek some type of mental help  If that don't work  then involve the police  That being said  I'm sure a therapist would only call the cops but it's worth a try  No logical person is going to say  "I can't reciprocate  I can't respond to your text hours later or within a day or two " This is 2017  People are glued to their phones  Whether I'm at work or at home  I'm looking at my phone at least every couple of hours  If he can't bother to send a quick one line text message out as a response then that's just being dishonest   I wouldn't say they "dictated" your relationship by asking you to put yourself out there more  That's a totally reasonable request  I mean  do you think it's fair that they should always be the ones to reach out and contact you to set things up  Setting things up can be tricky  and it's nice to not have to do it every time  If that's unreasonable from your end  then you can end the friendship  But odds are that's not an unreasonable request   Same thing here  Now that you're reaching out  it isn't fair that you reach out and get no response for weeks  when really all you're looking for is a quick  "Hey sorry  I was busy  Can't make it tonight " If that's an unreasonable request from his end  then he can end the friendship   In reality  neither his request or yours is unreasonable  But instead of just getting together and hashing this all out in a few minutes  you two are left sending 1 2 text messages which don't tell the full story  I would just leave it be for now and then talk about it a little more when you get together to iron it out  These things can sometimes be taken the wrong way via text instead of when you're talking in person  Great post as always  Sounds like something you should report to be honest  I don't know why you wouldn't  He's an adult and is responsible for his actions   Well you still have time to improve Thank you so much  Happy new year to you as well  How is life as a 40 year old FA  I haven't felt attraction to anyone for some time now  I am still a year short of 30  How do you pass time  There are times where I break down a little bit  and then my mood swings back to "normal"  Did you have that  If so  did it eventually die out  You are overthinking it  ya goddam asshole    Maybe have small goals for social outings  like get one person to laugh sincerely    Just be more you  If you are an asshole  this is difficult to enjoy  But some people enjoy being an asshole  Some people enjoy being around assholes  Find the other asshole and talk some shit with them  Find the other person who totally doesn't have shit to say and see if you can get them to say some shit  That ones my favorite  especially when that persons friends are like whoa  he or she never talks this much  It really is fun to connect to people  Not every time  but you miss 100  of the shots you don't take  Also  if you match people's excitement or interest level  and understand their personal space   other social preferences   it is easier to create a connection    I've had some social breakthroughs after watching some Tony Robbins videos on youtube  Also has a documentary on netflix that is pretty interesting  I just feel more ok saying whatever recently and not overthinking shit  That dude knows how to interact and connect to people   Find out any the live in your country  pm them finding out more  hobbies etc  Whichever one hits closest to home try to meet in person   The decision was made for me  by the government  that unless I take action it's their body   Just because I have an out doesn't make it right   The government has laid claim on my organs and body   Period   I'm downvoted because no one understands what liberty means anymore and I'm intentionally fighting to maintain it   Reddit simply downvotes opinions they don't like  we both know it   It's  funny how a government opting everyone into a porn filter is an outrage but opting everyone into organ donation is the best thing ever    Libel and damages    If this lawyer isn't willing to pursue  seek another  This case has many indications of being an easy victory  I think that's a great idea  and you should do it if you want to do it  People like that are a minority of society but obviously since this is ForeverAlone there are bound to be a lot of them gathered here  There's also what Tortuga said  you're less likely to come across them in real life  You could try posting an ad in FADating  I'm sure you'll get tons of replies  If she had a viable reason to not date you than you need to either fix that problem she's having or just pick your self off the ground and keep going  ahaha I had a feeling someone would say something like this the title was really poorly phrased on my part  '    YEAH LETS RUIN HIS WHOLE LIFE  POSSIBLY HAVE HIM MURDERED AND WHILE WE'RE AT IT  TARNISH HIS FAMILIES NAME ALL OVER A COUPLE OF ILLEGAL PHOTOS  THE REST PERFECTLY LEGAL AND NON NUDE  I hope so  Thanks for dealing with my rant or whatever  I'm just trying to get better before I just quit altogether  Thanks I sleep most of the day Would law enforcement there consider placing harassment and trespassing charges on those girls    appreciate the links   i will check these out  lol at the thought of opening with some heavy hitting questions  good god   Maybe move my weights into the shower too Thanks  that's pretty solid advice to be honest  and I'm sure even though I can be a little awkward I could pull off saying that to them and making it sound natural    That's definitely true  It's also true that it is difficult to distinguish when someone has been slipped something in their drink  That's why it's so effective  Paramedics may have made the same assumption you did   you're a male  you're with friends  so without someone specifically asking for a blood test to determine you were drugged  they didn't ask    Again  you may be right  Nothing mave have been slipped in anyone's drink  I definitely am not the authority to decide that  I'm just saying    I've never heard of such a dramatic  intense reaction to alcohol when alcohol has never affected someone in that way before    I mean  is it really more likely that you had a wildly uncharacteristic reaction to booze than that you had a reaction to a drug you've never experienced before     I get why you're resistant to the possibility  You may be right  But just do me a favor  Google the search term "date rape drug violent reactions"  The very first result lists ketamine as a common date rape drug  The common side affects of ketamine are loss of memory  loss of coordination  and violent or aggressive actions     Just  maybe don't dismiss the possibility out of hand  The women in your social circle might be at risk    Edited to add  ketamine is legal and used on animals  Anyone there that day a vet  or a veterinary student   I know the feeling  hah  A lot of people see texting as an informal version of email  so they don't think of it like a real conversation  Dyou live close to any of your discord people  If so irl meetups might be a thing to do   The new year's post really dragged in all the normie trash from  r all  Nah  fuck you  Also  your opinion is shit  That's my opinion  Problem  kid  You seem like a really nice friend  that's awesome dude  But she was under the influence of something that heightens sexuality  oxytocin feelings of closeness and all that  I would definitely just talk to her first to see if she remembers and how she feels about it  If it seems like it was a mistake then just let it go  No need to tell the BF unless it happens again   Firstly  you have to consider the stigma that comes with being known as a male virgin  Most guys aren't going to walk around advertising the fact out of shame  It's entirely possible that you've been around them and just didn't know it   Secondly  from the stories I've read plus my own experience  past a certain age  guys that are virgins tend to be shut ins who only leave the house for work and shopping  making them even more difficult to find   Lastly  we tend to have issues with social situations  so it can be uncommon to see us work up the courage to actually initiate a conversation  especially with a woman  I do feel unloveable whenever I see a couple holding hands walking together kissing I wouldn't say  in your case specifically  you're being selfish  You're not obligated by any means to initiate or sustain conversation with anyone that you don't want to partake in  You're probably just introverted and have more pressing matters on your mind  Nothing wrong with that  Don't let anyone tell you you're selfish because you don't care about what happened on The Bachelor last night   On the other hand  if someone's really putting a lot of trust in you to confide some issue that deserves a listening ear or a little input  the very best you can do is be up front and say  "Hey  I'm sorry  but this is pretty heavy for me and I'm not the person to be confiding this to "   Some people just don't want to talk and aren't big on conversation  no big deal    Now  regarding that quote in your titlewe get back what we put out to the world  That's about the only answer I can give to that  If you put out positivity  you'll get positivity back with a few outliers of assholes here and there  in which case  I personally try to be nice either way because getting negative back seems to just invite more negativity into the rest of my day    If you run into assholes all day  you're either living in an abusive household or workspace or you're probably projecting an energy that makes people think it's alright to unload their negativity on you  negativity met with negativity  where positivity is  predominantly met with positivity     Anyway  just my thoughts  Keep the peace and bacon grease  You've lived together two years and this behaviour started in the past two years   Maybe something about living together is annoying him  Great  thanks for your input  As long as the name doesn't sound ridiculous without my having realized it haha Im going through a hard time too  But realize that a hard time doesn't mean a terrible life   If she cheated on you then all you can do is move on  Take your time to feel however you need to but make plans to move forward  Does it really feel good being single for so long    You're being betrayed and hurt and put in danger by his decision to pursue illegal images   She's not being put in danger  It was also his decision because he's mentally sick  He needs help  Not to be locked up in a cell beaten and bruised possibly murdered over a couple of illegal images  We also don't know the whole story  Why were they there  Are we 100  sure it was him  Is this his first time being curious about it  Would he be a danger around children or would he just leave them be  They may be pedophiles but they do have self control  Most ain't going to go out and rape molest a bunch of children for the simple fact that they know they'll get caught  Whether it's a year down the road  or 10  they always get caught  I stopped caring a long time ago what people might think of my romantic sexual experience  So I don't think it would matter a whole lot but sure  it would probably feel a bit better to know I wasn't as far behind when compared with others my age  I know it's not   That's what I'm maybe thinking  I think it was my fault for even feeding into it  I think I said some stuff which made him feel insulted and this is his way of getting back   I would be normal  There wouldn't be shame or self doubt  That is just how things are  It would be easier to date too  as selfish as it may sound  You would know that you haven't been thrown out the gene pool  before you even try to find someone   Although  while Japan is witnessing men lost to solitude and withdrawal  aren't the women are just going for white guys  Yes   We don't allow any relationship dating sex advice in this sub  So this is your official warning  I'm literally at a loss for words after continuing to read this thread  The sheer amount of people that sympathize with pedophiles is outstanding  I have a degree in psychology so I fully understand that these individuals cannot control themselves and have a mental illness but that doesn't excuse their behavior         Yeah okay  Say what you will  but he is not directly harming children  He is adding to the pool of people who seek such content and is thus playing an extremely small role in increasing the demand for such content  which causes more of it to be created   Also  I dont know what you think turning him into the police so they can "track" the photos will do  Did you read the post  If you did you'll find that OP outlined 3 types of pictures she found on his phone  1  pictures of 8 11 in bikinis and cheerleading outfits  creepy as FUCK but not illegal  2  SELFIES of nude girls around the age of 13  illegal  and 6 year old girls in makeup  again creepy as FUCK but not illegal   The only actual child porn is of young girls taking naked photos of THEMSELVES    even 12 13 year olds sext these days  I'm absolutely NOT justifying ownership of such photos in anyway  Im just pointing out that they were self taken photos and there is no abuse or anything to track   It is fucked up to own CP  no arguing there  However I dont think it instantly makes you a horrible irredeemable person that should be given no second chances  I think it is pretty fucked up to turn someone in that has been loyal to you for years and helped you through hard times  OP should definitely talk to him first  and be there for him like he was to her  get him help  He saved her life from meth addiction  now it is time for her to at least warn him and get him help before he spirals down the wrong path  I think it is best for OP to end the relationship after doing this and either support him as a friend from there on out  or to cease contact  Best of luck OP   Happened to me in college  Got too far into the drug scene and got incredibly tired of the "who owes who" and how literally everything we did revolved around weed and other drugs  I ended up failing out  but im grateful I left  sometimes you gotta just remove toxic people from your life even if it means youll be alone at the moment  If its your senior year  then you must be going to college soon  only advice i can offer is to just have fun the rest of senior year and move on once you get out  Theres essentially no reason for you to communicate with these people once you get to college anyways  everyone will care about you a lot more than anyone you know from high school  Maybe just try a new sport or club or something to meet people with similar interests even if you may not have been friends before theres no reason you cant make some during senior year  No offense  but you really should pay attention to politics  Political decisions affect your life so you should be careful about what you choose  and make sure your choices represent you  Not saying to make your life about politics  but to be aware about it when important decisions are being made  You're not obligated to anyone but yourself  But know that consequences are needed to keep these things from happening again  This guy isn't nice and disregarded your no  He needed to be physically removed off of you and he wouldn't have stopped with just your protests  Had there not been other people there this would be an entirely different post  He should know that he can't get away with something like that  Nobody there was a veterinary student  we're all at sixth form currently  The only people  afaik  that have used drugs in the past are myself and my girlfriend at parties  only cannabis   and two of my school friends  who themselves have only tried cannabis   Though they did try to obtain some MDMA recently but the dealer was busy   I just can't see how it would've happened or who would've done it  You got it  Hmm I see where you're coming from  and maybe I should prep them   I'm just worried saying something like that might steer the conversation into talking about my sexuality  rather than talking about my partner I'm glad you're looking for a way out  My mom was in a very similar situation  we were hundreds of miles from any family  had to follow dad's rules or be punished  the dog was confined to a crate or chained outside in freezing weather  he kind of stole the car my mom drove while she was at choir practice to punish her for letting her sleep inside after surgery   It's not a good scene  Getting out of the situation will not only be better for your kids and yourself  but it might just help him to realize what he's doing too  My dad calmed down a lot after their divorce  Hopefully your husband can do the same  Bro I'm black and almost every black chick I know love Asian men just go for it  It's not that I didn't report it   The cops came and arrested him 20 minutes after it happened   Myself and the 7 other people who were there gave written statements   I just don't know if I want to go through with pressing charges     I don't exactly have money for a lawyer and I'm scared to have to go court   I have really bad social anxiety and on top of this I'm still in shock from what happened and what could have happened     Also   this could ruin this guys life   I really don't know what to do and I need to decide quickly    Congratulations  Seems like it was a great way to end 2016  Jesus you're dense      potentially turns a pervert into a rapist   I love me some redtube com I guess that means it could potentially turn me into a rapist   Correct     puts children at great risk  No it don't  He's looking at a still photograph that wasn't taken by him  He's not putting children at risk  the guy girl that actually took the photo put the child at risk     victimizes exploits children  Sure  the child was the victim and yes the photo exploits her him  That's the only thing that makes fucking sense in that whole comment  But 18  porn also do exploit women men  But not trying to go against that point cause I do agree  the next question to be pondering is what would you do if he refuses therapy or the therapy isn't working  do you still toss him in the slammer  do you leave him be and just hope he never acts on it  this is definitely a tough spot to be in   sidenote  might be better not to seem like you're riding a high horse or antagonizing people you disagree with ala "thick minded humans " I can understand the sentiment  but  as I'm sure you can imagine  emotions are kinda running around with this kind of a topic  so you might be adding fuel to the fire instead of helping out your point  just a thought  lol   Well  both names do sound strangely similar  but I think that makes it kind of cool  Wow  that's one lucky scum bag piece of shit human being  For some reason I feel guilty even though I didn't do anything except drink on New Years   which is exactly what most 22 year olds were doing Saturday night     I don't know   I still can't believe that actually happened to be honest  He could have some sort of anxiety or shyness problem that manifests itself in not being able to eat in front of people  I'm thinking about just sending the link to his profile so she can have at it herself  I'll have to check if non users can see it though  Is the feeling that I am enabling them  and about the dollars  it's not a big amount  but they could asked me first  now I feel like I cannot leave nothing valuable   I don't know about you guys but I have always been rejected by people I've tried to be friends with  All these rejections has  made my brain go from pro social to defensive when meeting new people  Every single encounter    I can't walk up to girls and say hi without a 3rd person introducing me  Cause my brain tells me that they will talk shit about me if I do it alone    Same with a bunch of random drunk guys at a party what if they think I'm a loser by just looking at me    Or a group of people  what if they all think I'm abit weird and freeze me out    I have no problem talking to people who i know has accepted me in someway  But if that's not the case  I'm always on the defensive  I don't take the initiative since I might get hurt doing so  I hate having my last few sets of feelings hurt    It's not about leaving the infamous comfort zone but rather the fact that my antisocial brain needs to be reprogrammed   "I am sorry  but I am fully committed at the moment to my current projects and can't take this on right now  especially on such short notice  All the best  furious pillows"  This would be my approach  You hint that you would  if you could   You provide a legitimate reason for not helping  which if there is push back you can always tell your manager that helping him would have resulted in you not delivering something vital and in your job  You underline the reasonableness of your position by highlighting the zero advance notice given  which if he pushes back either emphasizes their incompetence  since they can't do it without you  or demonstrates poor time management  All the best is my preferred generic closing  why in the world would you feel guilty  I'd bring up that they should  even though it will likely be taken as an insult  Any head trauma  recent or in the past  Another thing to look into is the possibility of a mental health disorder  Depression among other things can cause similar stuff  Restraining orders  no contact order etc  They will clearly break the order and then get punished criminally   If shes completely addicted and wants to stop  she needs to go to inpatient detox and rehab  Her environment isnt changing at home so why would she  Something has to give and its better its her toxic environment than her life  You had me until you said traditional relationship where you stay at home   What is the point of staying home if you don't have kids  That just seems like laziness to me  Lol  this is stupid  "The Gazette  Girugamesh  Ayabie  Slipknot Lynch  Metallica  Death Grips  and some jazz " She didn't  Shit just started falling apart  And still falling apart  I killed everything that could make this year something good   Adding fuel to the fire seems to be my thing lately lol  But yeah that's touchy then  After being caught  if he still proceeds downloading photos and videos  or gets worse  then that's 100  a red flag to report him  Getting caught doing something that highly illegal would be enough to make your heart explode  I'm sure he wouldn't even attempt to search for that shit again  or he could just be cocky and be more careful not to get caught lol  Child pornography has always been a touchy subject for me  On one hand  I think it should be very very illegal because of all the helpless children it destroys  but on the other hand I find someplace in my heart to have sympathy for the pedophiles because it's pretty clear either something happened in their childhood  or they just took a wrong turn  They just need mental help  the amount varies form person to person  For all we know OP's husband could of been sexually abused as a kid himself and just never wanted to talk about it or bring it up from the flaming depths of hell  Well it seems like something needs to be done about it  Seems like it would've escalated to full on rape if that dude didn't intervene  Won't the court appoint a lawyer if you can't afford one  It's never too late to reinvent yourself  What is the worst that could happen  They don't like the real you  How does that hurt you  Why do they have to like you        Congrats on free college It depends WHY her parents don't believe it's real   If they're likely to listen to science  there have been studies done where the MRI of depressed or anxious people doesn't look like the MRI of someone without depression anxiety   As a side note  if your friend is suicidal  especially if she has made plans or anything like that  she needs help ASAP  Even if it means going to the hospital  Do it  I'm not sure where you are  but changing your Name in the UK is so easy  With how backwards we generally are law wise  I'd imagine its even easier elsewhere  Good luck  Well most of the people I'm around I see a lot    In a nutshell  it's a personal choice  If you feel like doing it  then do it  Everyone else can get used to it   Here's my perspective     Initials shouldn't be a big deal  Even crazy initials like FUK or ASS aren't a big deal  It's just something for people to laugh at every now and then  but then you just shrug and move on  Maybe kids made a big deal of it in school  but by now no one should care all that much  Even without a middle name  how bad can your first and last name initials be  The worst 2 letter combo I can think of is FU  but even then  who really cares  I'm curious now  do you mind sharing what your initials are     I gotta say  there's a bit of irony with wanting to represent both ethnicities of your family by adding "Whited" of all words to "Nguyen"  Surely you can see the poetry in that        Are you female  If you're female  are you planning on taking your husband's name anyway when you get married  My wife is from China  and I guess they don't really do that over there  so if that's your case I would understand wanting to make sure you change your name and are able to rep both your families for the rest of your life  Then if you have kids  are you fine with them just taking your husband's surname      Are you male  If so  then what do you expect of your future wife  Do you want her to adopt that hyphenated name  Would you be okay with her keeping her maiden name  What do you envision for your kids  Let's say you marry someone with the last name Johnson  Surely you can't expect them to take on the name "Nguyen Whited Johnson" to represent both sides of their family  And isn't it a bit odd for them to rep both sides of their father's family but no sides of their mother's     Are you okay with dealing with the hassle from a hyphenated name  It won't fit in a lot of forms  People will probably just say "Nguyen" instead of bothering to say the full "Nguyen Whited" anyway  In fact  given that "Whited" sounds like you're "Whiting" an Asian name  it might make a few people uncomfortable to say the whole thing  Nobody outside of you and your mom is going to get any satisfaction out of this  and it's going to be a bit more of a hassle for everyone else and for you too   All that being said  if it's important to you  then by all means  go for it  A hyphenated name is not the worst thing in the world for people to deal with  Considering you feel strong enough about this to go through with it  then your feelings trump any minor inconvenience anyone else feels  Although I think it's worth thinking about your future husband wife's name and what surname you'll give your kids   Personally  I have my dad's surname of course  I married my wife who kept her original surname  Now we just had our first child a month ago who has only my surname  It's a little weird at first  but it's not anything I really give any thought to or worry about  Since we are a multi ethnic family  I guess I wouldn't have any issue if she wanted to add my wife's last name to hers eventually  but I'll leave that for her if she actually wants to  I don't really give two shits about surnames  Most people only call me by my first name anyway  and my last name is just a way to distinguish if they happen to know someone else who also has my first name   In terms of timing  I suppose I would do it before you graduate so your high school diploma can have your new hyphenated name  Other than that  I don't see any rush to get it done before 18  You can always have a new passport  birth certificate  or driver's license created  But they'll only issue you your one diploma  so it's kind of nice to make sure that has the correct name  Cheers dude  I think I probably will mention it to her  yeah mdma makes people very lovey dovey  I'm pretty indifferent about age  I'm old though  and so would be wary about dating someone younger  say  25 or lower   Society is obsessed with age and frowns upon makes a bunch of judgments when there's a 10  year gap   Also before 25 people are still growing up changing  Throughout my life I've met a number of people who were like me  but somewhere between 20   30 became completely different people  It would suck to finally meet someone cool only to have them "grow up" and drift apart  I feel like at 30  people are kind of set in who they are  so there's a better chance of a long term  stable thing if I can  could  ever    as if  find someone in my own age group  You're making this correlation between drug users and someone who drugs a drink that I don't think is fair  Plenty of people do drugs without slipping them into drinks  My point has absolutely nothing to do with who does and doesn't use drugs    Anyway  besides that  I take your word for it  Just suggesting it may be wise to be aware  keep an eye on your women friends when everyone's out drinking  If this happens to someone else  you'd know more   if not  that's a good thing of course  I can't really speak for everybody  but I find bald men extremely attractive  And 5 foot 6 doesn't really matter either   Those who matter don't mind  those who mind don't matter   Hahaahah  Face my anxieties Yeah  it's annoying  I talk and treat messaging as a real life conversation  maybe that's why I'm so annoyed with messaging when I come across people that treat it like email hm     And no  in those groups from discord  the people I talk with are not even from the same country  I'm talking in english on those groups  So basically meetups are more likely not gonna happen  Have you talked to a doctor about it    Next time you want to start something or a project  When you get that rush of something new  just stop  Don't start  Deny that instant gratification  Stop the cycle at the beginning and just focus on researching the process of the project and don't start it until you have thought through the process from beginning to end  If you are still interested after doing that  then try the project  if not move on  Continually step out of your comfort zone and test yourself  You give up when you either think you could do it if your tired  or if that's just the lie you tell yourself to save your pride the risk of failure  Do you really think you can do these projects  Or is it just safer to continually delude yourself into thinking you can by not finishing them   Congrats on a job well done  OP  So you would probably have no problem with a child molester living next to you and your kids if he's good looking  right  Anyone who has a problem with that must be a jelly hater  right  I don't know   I guess I'm too empathetic   I was just going to drop the charges but then I found out he wouldn't get fined or anything if I do   and I don't want him to just get away with it   This is why I'm so torn   I don't know if he'll learn his lesson unless I press charges but if I do it may potentially ruin his life   He'll be considered a sex offender for at least the next 15 years  You can't please everyone in life  There will be people who will judge you and not like you no matter how much a mask you wear  It's a lot less stressful to just be you and not try to compartmentalize your personality so much   Hi  fellow Singaporean  First of all  I agree that you're still young  and your life is only just beginning  I know education and results are highly regarded  but it isn't everything  Maybe you feel kind of lost  and regretful about your past  but there's nothing you can change there  Don't give up on getting into your dream course    Humans are all a work in progress  You can get better  and get worse  Nothing is constant  and I think as long as you keep searching for it  your meaning of life will present itself to you in various ways  through new experiences  new people you'll come across    Our thoughts can be really overpowering sometimes  If you don't mind  could you share what your goals are in life  It's not easy to keep a positive mind  but if you go into something already believing that you'll fail at it  I think you'll severely reduce your chances of success  since you go into an attempt believing you'll fail from the start    Sometimes your goals can seem so far away  but if you break it down into smaller  less intimidating goals  small steps that you can take  you'll still get there    I'm sorry  I know this is all easier said than done  I struggle with the same feelings of dejection  But I'd made a mistake  and still continue to do so  I gave up trying  and that's where nothing gets better    Negative thinking and self hatred will never help us progress and only hold us back  It's hard  but you've got to try to learn to love yourself  and accept your faults  be kind to yourself and give yourself time to see your efforts pay off   I can't do this either  but I know if I could  things would be different     Is there anything that you currently find enjoyment in  Sometimes it doesn't have to be anything major  The smallest things in life can be enjoyable as well  and sometimes that's all we need to get by    As for keeping in touch with old friends  that's hard  because everyone moves on through different phases of life  Some people do keep in touch  and if you've tried  then perhaps it's not you but your mates that may be less interested in doing so  There are always new friends to be made though   Sorry for my quite useless comment  If you wanna talk anytime  hit me up  Do you at least collect disability or something  If it's that big of a headache  I'd just find a friend who you gel with more  I've got 5 very close friends that I've been friends with ever since high school or college  10 20 years ago depending on the person   I never got into it with any of them  I told you about my one friend who didn't respond to things  Once we worked it out  everything was fine  One of my friends was always a bit too judgmental when we stepped out of our shells or tried new things  so we confronted him about that and he toned it way down  One of my friends would dirty up every dish we had and never washed them  We didn't really resolve that one  other than deciding we can still be friends  but we just can't live together      All these things should be able to be worked out  This whole back and forth about someone texting someone back is such a minor problem in the grand scheme of things  You guys should be able to sit down together and hash this whole thing out in 5 10 minutes  set clear expectations  and move forward without any more problems  If you can't  then find a friend who is more reasonable  She's just shallow as fuck  Sex is not everything you'll find someone Yeah  It's just hard to "reinvent" myself  I guess  Yep  she released an album in 2008 and in 2009 she released an other album in collaboration with Pete Yorn  Here's her  Spotify page  https   open spotify com artist 2KAaJOwfu8n93byx6YPRPa   I saw you in another thread  you seem like a troll or some mental case or something    Either way  I doubt you're that special  You can't get dick because you're probably a narcissistic asshole who likes to be the black cloud looming over every discussion online or offline  Or at the very least not as beautiful smart or talented as you'd like to think  But whatever helps you sleep at night  honey  not like I'll ever know or really care after I hit the send button  Come up with a plan together  As u panic bread said  she doesn't need his permission  just a plan to get out  She writes him a clear  decisive note or sits him down and has a forthright conversation  you can be here for this if she needs support   She says things like 'this is what I am doing'  Doesn't ask  simple informs him of her decision  Help her move  give her a couch to crash on for a while if you can    After that  encourage minimal contact between them  It will be a big change for her and the attraction to return to the familiar will be strong  He will also attempt to manipulate the situation  so aim to prevent that as much as possible  Keep her company  keep her busy and encourage her to do stuff without him  This will probably be hard at first  but keep at it    Good luck Instead of saying "I'll never drink again" try setting a definite limit  say 2 beers or 1 glass of wine or 1 mixed drink  Have a friend stop you if you want more  and always have non alcoholic options available in social situations  Counseling is definitely a good thing    When you saw him go to shave his head  if seems like you wanted to stop him from doing something he'd regret in the morning  When he said no  it probably felt like he was telling you that your opinions  in this case  on his appearance  don't matter  which your drunk mind blew up into "he doesn't care what I think ever at all in general"  which triggered the overreaction  Why you went upstairs and did the slit your throats thing I have no theories on  Has anybody told you what happened during the times you weren't there  you can't remember  Knowing that might help you figure out where to go from here  Lol at everyone downvoting because they're jealous of the attention you'll get xD  Dont try to destroy all of his life for this reason  Thats a hotfix to the problem  many see that hotfix as good enough however   Help him not deal any damage by acting on these preferences   welcome to earth  https   youtu be GibiNy4d4gc  You're 18  Got your whole life ahead of you  Do some soul searching  Rather than complying with his needs and wants  find out what makes you happy and your interests  Then expand your social circle based on your strengths   Good thing about breaking up on New year's is that you have 364 more days of the year to make it the best ever   You're still young  Enjoy what life gives you and dont measure your happiness on how well you make others happy  Yep  You're me  minus the doctor's visits and the couch surfing  I got nothing for either of us   s  oolala  Imagine doing it the other way around  If it was possible to send a message or influence your younger self in some way  What would you tell show your younger self    Would you try and take steps to improve your current situation or would you deliver a caveat  For the record   The original article title did say "mandatory" which I used word for word  The article title has changed since  For articles like this I don't editorialize the title   Brutally honest is good  and thank you for this       This is exactly what I was thinking for her reasoning for sending it  I'm thinking she's doing it for "old time's sake" or something like that  Which is fine  but I'm not going to go just for old time's sake  If this was someone I talked to a bit more often  not just when we go out to dinner or something  I might feel different  As it is      I asked our mutual friend if she's going  and she said she probably is  Personally  I have no idea why  she doesn't talk to her much more than I do  But whatever  to each their own   listed Maine twice   If you swallow his cum you eliminate any possible but extremely unlikely scenarios    you might not like the taste but you can guarantee it won't get you pregnant  You can have a drink ready just in case   Giving a blowjob with a condom on isn't going to be as good for him as without AND you could be left with a nasty taste in your mouth  even with the flavoured ones  before he has cum  If a person trusts their SO and know they are clean  both hygienically and free from STDs  IMO a condom for oral is overkill  unnecessary and likely to spoil the event  Of course  I can also say  if he put his penis away post sex it would prevent you being paranoid afterwards    It isn't good for your health to keep taking plan b  YMMV  It isn't intended as a backup option for post event contraception  Taking the pill will be a better option   assuming you don't have significant side effects   if you do  change the brand  Do note that they advise you to take the pill before it can be consider effective  2 5 weeks usually    i e  you cannot just take the pill a couple of days before having unprotected sex and expect it to prevent a pregnancy   I dunno if a relapse is really enough to throw someone in the slammer either  changes takes time  how many people do we know that get caught with weed and keep doing it  how about graffiti  all of these kinda offenses become part of your lifestyle  and that can be hard to change  taking time and persistence  this is obviously a guilty pleasure of his and I don't see him not dipping back into it  even with therapy  but yeah  mental help first   might be good to ask what the law would do about it  esp if he's just looked at pictures  is that considered punishable under the law or is it just if he's acted out on it  does it put him on a registry  Complete the course  Think long term  The benefits outweigh the costs  Well that's unfortunate  I'm sorry about your situation  But someone who doesn't contribute at all is basically a no starter for someone like me who doesn't make much money in the first place  Maybe you'll find your sugar daddy somewhere  Your permissiveness is absolutely astounding  and even more so after reading through your comments  I don't really care if you or anyone else likes my opinion on this  It's illegal for a reason  as well as morally abhorrent  It's child porn  plain and simple  so go ahead and dismiss it as no big deal    Thank you so much  That's exactly my reasoning for not wanting to go    why waste money for someone who doesn't really want to be there    Also  I'm going to be a maid of honor at my best friend's wedding in the fall  and it's out of state  a state next to me  but out of state nonetheless    This wedding would be right around that one  I think   While I could afford to be in her wedding and go to this one  I'd rather not waste money on this one  We'll see what I decide  but right now I'm thinking I won't go  I too think of possible conversions  But more often than not when I have something interesting or cool to say in a certain moment  that subject never comes up or the moment never arises   Girlfriends are only a good thing if your hot  otherwise they'll probably cheat on you   Yeah if they did take it they were taking advantage of your generosity of allowing them into your home  I totally understand not wanting to enable them  Some people will just keep taking and you have to cut them off  I guess that would make sense looking at my childhood  Very true  And sadly I'm sure he would get put on the registry  I say sadly because he never physically touched children  If you piss in public you could be slapped on the registry so  Depends on how old you   your "girlfriend" are  Sorry  having trouble framing your story here     She's your girlfriend now  right  You called her by her best friend's name by accident  and now she won't talk to you  Now you're all back at her best friend's house and you're out on a walk because you're mad  Is that right  Just want to make sure I'm on the right track before diving in   Clearly this should not be a big deal  and that's why you're upset  right  You said the wrong name  but it's not because you wish you were dating her best friend  you just garbled the names up  You tried to explain that but she's not listening to you and she still won't talk to you  but your friends are trying to play it off as a joke  If she's still not talking to you  then it seems like she really is mad at you  which in my opinion is asinine    If I'm in your shoes  I would go back  ask the friends to give you the room for a couple minutes  then talk to her 1 on 1  Ask her to talk to you  If she won't talk  then tell her "It's pretty clear you're upset with me and don't want to talk to me  so I'll give you some space  Give me a call when you're ready to talk "  If she's the type of girl who just shuts down like this when she gets mad  then that's someone I would not want to deal with  I had a girlfriend in the past who shut down when she was mad and wouldn't ever try to communicate or clear things up  She would take something the wrong way  and then completely blow up and leave in a huff  After some time she would calm down and then we would talk again as if nothing ever happened   Shutting down is not how you deal with anger or issues in a relationship  You need to be able to talk to your partner  If you're too mad to talk  then you should do like you did and go take a walk or get some space until you're calmed down and ready to talk  If she's not willing to do that  then you've got your work cut out for you mate  You not only have to deal with whatever BS she's mad about right now  but you also have to teach her how to properly communicate her feelings when she's mad  That's a tall order and is going to take time and pain to work through   Sometimes there's nothing you can do right now in that moment to calm her down other than give her space  So see if after your walk she's calmed down enough that you two can hash things out  If not  then give her some more space until she's ready to talk  Ah  that's too bad  The last bit of advice I have is you could move  but that's a huge and expensive commitment with uncertain results  Sometimes you just run dry on the dating pool  and have to have a change of scenery so you can be the sexy foreigner out of towner  Bonus points if your accent is different   I give horrible advice pls forgive me  contact the youtuber I'm in the same boat  my dog is 14 diabetic  blind and deaf  She and I have been attached at the hip since we got her when I was a kid  Just make the pets life as comfortable as possible and make it feel loved  I've already accepted that my dog will probably die soon  and I'm okay with it  I'm not sure how to help someone else accept it but just try to stay strong for the pet  family means more to a pet than one would think I guess you would just delete that reminder post  Because consent is assumed until you make an active declaration  It's a comment under someone's post    Just think of what could have happened if your friend had not stepped in or if they had misconstrued what was going on  and thought it was consensual   He was just fine with potentially ruining your life  He may have learned his lesson  but maybe he didn't and you could be saving someone else who might not have someone there to stop him  I moved to The US a couple of years ago and I don't have a degree  It's hard and you need a company sponsoring you to come here or need to marry a US citizen  Without a degree it will be hard as they look for immigrants with certain skillets they lack  The other visa options are the entrepreneur visa   120k savings needed annually  or person of extraordinary ability ie best in the world within your field   You can stay here for 3 months after completing an ESTA however you wont get work as you can't get a social security number without a visa and without social security you can't do anything no bank  pay bills  etc   There are many places round the world which will be easier to get into than the US and right now unless you are in STEM fields  science  maths  etc  the hiring market isn't that strong   Good question  You see  the other 3 still have the stink of your mom's pussy on them  The dry cleaners said they have tried everything they can't get it out  I was going to donate them to charity but have strict rules regarding bio hazardous materials  I'm going to have to dish out another 2 bills for another one after my date with your mom on thursday  The sex is worth it though   Sweet thanks  I thought I just needed someone else to look at it Jesus that's tough  I'd grab evidence  pictures of the wall and the bruises on your girlfriend  and take it to the chief of police  With consent from your girlfriend  she might have to be there as well  So if OP walked in on her boyfriend making out with a 13 year old would you make excuses for him then  too  Or are you only supportive of breaking the law when  you  judge that there's no victims    It's very likely that the 2 illegal ones aren't the  only  ones he's sought out  They're just the ones that are currently saves to his phone    He needs help  But a lot programs will turn him away because one of the rules is they will only accept you  if you haven't acted on your urges   He has acted  He has actively broken the law   Would you say that slave owners 300 years ago weren't contributing to the demand for slaves  After all  one man doesn't make the entire economy  But he does contribute  OP's boyfriend is actively contributing knowing that he is most likely helping to harm children  He's not a child unaware that his actions have consequences  He's a full grown adult  Has he helped OP  Yes  Does that redeem him somehow  No  OP wasn't going around collecting pictures of children    I find it highly disturbing that you're so willing to shrug off a man violating pictures of innocent little girls  How would you feel if you posted a picture of your daughter in a cheerleaders outfit and then found out some creep jacked off to it  How would you feel if  you  were the kid   As to the girls who took photos of themselves  children are vulnerable and easily groomed  It is not difficult at all for older men or women to pay "special attention" to children and manipulate them into taking such photos  Those girls may not be being whipped or starved  but they shouldn't be ignored because there "might not be" abuse wtf  "Oh well  they took the pictures without anyone else in the room  Clearly it's a healthy thing and I shouldn't bother looking too closely "  Also OP owes her boyfriend nothing  He chose of his own free will to help her  Quite possibly to get to this exact situation  I e  "if she ever finds out  she'll never betray me"   I felt like this for a long time until I started working out  I do not take antidepressants or anti anxiety pills anymore because they made my "feelings vacuum" worse  But since i began working out in March 2015  I have felt tons better  And the added bonus of being healthier has helped with having a positive outlook   I agree that the best thing she can do is forgive and move on   However  forgiveness isn't easy   it's not a switch one can push   This is especially true when those you wish to forgive may not admit to what they have done or show remorse       So yes  forgiveness is healthy and right   But one step at a time   The OP should focus on herself   on healing and on finding happiness   and if not actually forgiving her parents  at least trying not to hate them   and trying not to dwell on all they did wrong         So my advice  look forward  not back   Look for reasons for joy  not reasons for anger   Ignore your mother's request to contact him   unless it is something you need   Good luck and hugs for the new year  I'm not saying it's no big deal  And your opinion is your opinion just as much as what mine is  Yes  it's very illegal for a reason  I agree with it being illegal  If it wasn't they'd be selling it on the side of the streets  on magazine racks  just like they used to  I'm saying his case isn't so severe  It could be worse  He could be out physically harming children  then he needs jail time  It's pointless to try and lock her husband up because it's only eating away at our tax dollars and leaving less room in prisons for the real rapists  molesters  murderers  etc  It's like throwing a drug user in a prison  They don't need to learn a hard lesson  the need help  Prison is    far    from help  even though it's suppose to rehabilitate the inmates  all it really does is turns them into bigger and worse threats to society   Et al with a link sounds good  making sure to use the first author and et al  It gives due credit to all  without changing orders of authorship   yep  even for streaking or peeing in public the side of the road   Judging by your grammar  you're not American  So  I'll give you some information on American law  whether you agree or disagree with them  I don't give a shit  It's a not a gray area that you think it is  The US laws are very strict about child pronography  According to United states Department of Justice    Images of child pornography are not protected under First Amendment rights  and are illegal contraband under federal law  Section 2256 of Title 18  United States Code  defines child pornography as any visual depiction of sexually explicit conduct involving a minor  someone under 18 years of age    Visual depictions include photographs  videos  digital or computer generated images indistinguishable from an actual minor  and images created  adapted  or modified  but appear to depict an identifiable  actual minor   Undeveloped film  undeveloped videotape  and electronically stored data that can be converted into a visual image of child pornography are also deemed illegal visual depictions under federal law    I'll let you read the rest  https   www justice gov criminal ceos citizens guide us federal law child pornography   Whether we agree or disagree to causation of pedophilia  the law is the law concerning child pornography in the United States  You can't compare it to drugs  because drug use is a victimless crime and child pornography is not a victimless crime   That is all I have to say  Good day  sir  Heh  This sounds a little like my relationship  Heh  Heh  O O The thing is she was my friend first and foremost and I haven't made it official with her  even though she's been pushing me to do so  She would help me out with my ex when I was having problems  My ex was the one who broke up with me  I never loved someone as much as her so I was devastated and hurt but I think she regrets her decision  My friend was there giving me support    and I starting spending more time with her  But I don't know if I love her as much as my ex  so should I go for the one I love or go for the one that really loves me   This is due to the fact that many people spend a significant portion of their time with their SO and do activities with them so them being included in the story is a natural consequence    I don't think it has anything to do with social signaling or trying to boost their ego  I think it's fantastically rude of OP to walk into a group of 20 000 people and expect those people to do work that OP could have done   If OP wants an answer to their question from one of these 20 000 unpaid volunteers the very least they should do is not ask a fucking stupid question   HTH HAND  Your boyfriend is no longer your main priority  If you want to keep the child  which is is totally your choice   then you need to concern yourself with your child  Your boyfriend needs to step up and support whatever decision you make  Anyone who thinks their life is ruined by fathering a child has no business having sex   No one's talked to me about the whole incident  This group of friends was mainly all of the guys who are friends and their girlfriends  so I'm not super close with any of them  We hang out regularly  or used to now  I guess  but always as a group  never one on one  if that makes sense   In the morning  people seemed to be in good spirits and I did have a couple short  meaningless conversations with a couple of people but no one really talked about the night before  So I'm just waiting on my boyfriend to call me now so I can get help with the blank spots in my memory and hear his side of the story  Just break up with him  let him see what he's missing  I'll bet those feelings suddenly come back again  and if not  so what  Plenty more  eh  I'm a troll for loving myself   And actually  being awkward is my only problem  My cousin says I reject every guy that talks to me because I don't even know they're flirting until they walk away and she tells me xD   And if you didn't care you wouldn't even be replying to me  so don't tell that lie  Yeah  You lay on your back  if you have a life vest it's easier for balance  and just curl to legs up  I am so sorry for your loss    I am certain he knew how much he meant to you  and that he felt appreciated in your relationship   Be kind to yourself   What  In  The  Actual  Fuck  I am working on improving my life lol   it takes many years of perseverence   I added to the conversation on this thread because of some bullshit that happened in the world and now i cant complain about it   Lol so any injustice or any inequality in this world we're supposed to just be complacent   Theres 24 hours in a day i think i can take a few minutes to call out bullshit when i see it   I'm not saying it's no big deal   Yes you are    It could be worse  He could be out physically harming children  He is harming children now by downloading those pictures and whether you believe it or not  physically harming children is most likely right down the road    Most people going through a university course really feel like dropping it at some point  and it must be daunting having so much study time left  The decision to leave is ultimately yours  but I think you need to think primarily about how much time you are going to save  short or long term  Whether it's time you can save having those years ahead of you cleared up  despite having wasted 2 years  and now be confident you can have a good career without the degree  or have no time in the future because you have not gotten the degree and theoretically get paid less   You can hardly get a job anywhere without a certification today either  If you distinctly want to do something else  then getting out of your current course could go quite well   You don't necessarily need to do the degree cold turkey either  Explore options for breaks in study or other compromises   I really tried to keep it open  but I think you should stick to it  It will show dedication  if nothing else  And 7 years later  can you imagine the feeling of finishing  No I'm Canadian  Much like you American's  pedophiles also get beat in prisons here to      because drug use is a victimless crime  PLEASE  Yeah cause when my father was a crack head beating the whole household cause he couldn't get his fix we weren't victims  Drug abuse VERY MUCH SO victimizes the people around the user  You really don't have to tell me about drug use  I was surrounded by it for 18 straight years and was scarred mentally because of it  So if women aren't people are they aliens  That's DEFINITELY the reason why you're being downvoted  Don't you know everyone here is a raging misogynist who hates women  Yeah  but you should be able to delete any post of yours  Doesn't matter where what it is  Doesn't matter if I replied to the post like I did '7 minutes ago' or am replying to you now    If you can't delete it then  I'm just clueless on what you should do  Sorry man  Do you use Reddit Enhancement Suite  Try that  Has anyone asked what your grandma wants  Is she fully aware of what is happening in this situation    the descriptions of how sex was sounded so much hotter and organic   Exactly I would love to give it a go  Nothing beats taboo sex man  Black metal  dungeon synth  This album is the best one ever https   www youtube com watch v 8f06FcM6lJk A big red flag here is that you say you essentially change yourself for them  to "adhere to their lives"    That's not mature or healthy  Don't do that  Just be you  and if he's worth your time he'll love you for who you are and not who you pretend to be for him  It's not possible for someone to love someone else when they don't know who that person really is   He's not harming the children  Them children got no idea that he has those photos  The one that was harming the child was the one who took them photos  And no  I'm not saying that it's no big deal  Of course it's a big deal  Without help he'll continue doing what he's doing  Not saying that he will ever go to the extreme as to actually touch a child  But getting thrown into handcuffs and beaten by inmates is not help  he'll only carry on doing it once he gets released  if he gets locked up at all  You should watch  the documentary  you will change your mind This is so emotional to read  as I have gone through a couple of heartbreaking breakups through time  Thanks for sharing  I wish you all the best and I want to say that nobody deserves to be cheated on  I am sorry this has happened to you  Time heals  All hangouts are always both  if you end up together it was the romantic first date  if you don't it was hanging out with friends   Romance is something in hindsight so go in with the mindset as hanging out  Virginity is a stupid concept anyways  PIV intercourse doesn't have to equate to sex  Sex is more than just that    Do you feel happy with your decision  Not anymore   You either keep her as a fwb or risk it and ask her out  It's all on you  people are mean If abortion isn't an option  then you have no choice but to tell him   If you feel like he'll stay in the relationship out of obligation  don't let him  It does take too   Tell him he can be involved with his child as much as he wants  but a relationship between the two of you isn't necessary   I've done it alone and with a spouse   Alone isn't bad as you imagine  In some ways  even easier   Good luck and best wishes  Well Costa Rica is amazing  It has everything like volcanos  hot springs  rain forests  cloud forests  Atlantic beaches  Pacific beaches  caves  rivers  valleys mountains  fauna  flora  It takes a good while to see it all  Depends where he lives  If it's a small town  chief and him might be buddy buddy and fuck over op  As many have said get him to the vet  If he has recently had surgery there's a good chance it's related however it may not be  search for websites that review local prostitutes  and see if they have non pros sections  or dig through the pages Yet  a man has to contribute money  or else he's utterly worthless   Quite the double standard  They are interested in you because you sent them nudes and they are teenage boys  Just ignore them  what they think of you doesn't matter  You might want to consider cutting back on the drinking if this is how you act when drunk  to protect yourself  because you don't know if one guy might decide to use the pictures against you when you don't give into him later on  Especially if you are in the US because I'm pretty sure it would be classified as child pornography   Hey I wrote a post about this  it is directed at partners  but could be helpful here too  https   kylarosesims wordpress com 2016 11 23 when your partner has anxiety 8 tips for getting help   I didn't have insurance either and now I use a digital therapist because I live in a place where I don't speak the language and the waits for help are long  Let me know if this is helpful   Hey  thanks for your answer  I do live near a university with hospital but unfortunately it only accepts very poor people because  well  public mental health facilities on my country are a joke   and most of the time  private are too  so they put those thresholds to target those that  really  need it  But theres also some universities who offer free psicological therapy care  theres even one very close to me  I am just a little affraid of trying something witj students given my experience with so called  professionals   Some prejudice of my part  I know  You only have 2 options   You could tell him  have a long conversation about how you both want the future to be  where you tell him about your worries that you don't want to let him give up his dream  He could either insist joining the coast guard and not be in a relationship or he could be very supporting and so happy with becoming a father   Or you could not tell him  let the baby be born  With no support from him whatsoever because you didn't told him  You'd be always wondering 'what if' and wanting him and still hoping for a happy ending  Where he'll eventually find out anyway and be mad at you for not telling him sooner and having zero change at ever becoming friends or having a relationship again  Where the baby would also suffer from   So I guess you only have one choice  Tell him  It's the best for everyone  He'll either leave you because he's not ready or he'll love being a father  Better to find out now than wondering for years   May I ask why abortion isn't an option  You should only keep the baby if you really want to  while you can support it financially and give it all of your love and time   Its a tough call  If he got you totally clean and sober from Meth addiction  then he saved your life  It's the equivalent of pushing some out of of the way of a moving train    Easy for people on the outside looking in to tell you what to do  Everyone on Reddit has a moral compass that supersedes Batman and Gandhi   so don't believe everything you read here  Talk to real humans   EDIT  I know this is weird to say but if you contact your local police  it won't help those children  In theory it will but not those specific ones  The local police are not going to allocate funds to hunt down a kiddy porn ring  they only want it in the paper so they look good   Contacting the police  may  be right to do in time  but I've read a lot of posts that essentially say "contact the police right away and then the kids will be safe and happy   and by the way  you will feel better about it in a couple years " I know what I just said was kind of unfair but use your best judgement and don't trap yourself  make a list of pros and cons for alerting authorities   Pros  He goes to jail    child porn rates drop in the USA      the children he has on his phone will be rescued    You won't be disgusted when you look at him because he will be in jail  getting beaten up  and he will never hold a decent job ever again in his life     Cons  What do you think   Again  I'm just saying this stuff because I know what it is like to have one person really help out when I fell on hard times 12 years ago  As far as I am concerned if that person is god to me  And again  don't believe everything you read from these people  If I were seeing a psychologist or a doctor who studies abnormal psychology and they told me that they help people on Reddit  I would instantly lose all respect for them  This is not the medium to offer advice as a professional     I just want him to be happy and I feel like I'll ruin his life if I tell him   Well  you're pregnant no matter if you tell him or not  Not telling him would just come close to a lie  It's also not you who ruins his life  I mean    You didn't get pregnant on your own  right  He's equally  responsible for your pregnancy as you are  And having a child doesn't automatically result in a ruined life   Just tell him what you wrote  That you don't want him to feel obligated  but you'd also be very happy if he wouldn't let you alone with the situation  The rest is his decision  If he's old enough to get you pregnant  he should be old enough to make that decision  Life is what you make it  If your life feels empty  then you're not filling it with anything  Most likely you're seeking something  such as approval  or fulfillment from others  You are you  You are your life  There is no other besides you  yourself  If you're unhappy  change it  If you're bored  do something  If you're lethargic  start being more active   For god's sake  you're here for 80 years max  and you're going to waste that time staring at yourself and being miserable  You have one shot  and anything you work hard enough to attain can be yours  You frame your life   If you need it  I'll help get you out of the rut  I've done it for so many others  Just PM me  and we'll get on it right away  You just need somebody who won't judge you to smash that first boot up your ass  to listen to your issues  to be the guiding hand until you have your wings  My girlfriend snores and it's honestly one of the cutest things she does  When we snuggle or during some of the few time we get to sleep over it's one of the things that let's me know she's close  I can't help but smile thinking about it  actually     Agreed   Any advice solely hinges on this information  Dude  I really appreciate this post  You perfectly worded my own thoughts and struggles  Unfortunately FWB usually one of you starts feeling this way  As the previous comment said  you gamble or you don't   You could say something not so direct about it like  "How have things been going without your Mom around " Thanks  This mindset is probably what led me to be so much more successful making friends this time around   I'm not balding but my best friend is and he's like you  very insecure about balding which is completely understandable  ok here's a few things    First of all being bald doesn't instantly make you unattractive  like seriously have you seen the amount of guys who are bald  I know you're young  but it really isn't an instant turn off otherwise half the male population would be fucked     Accept it and embrace it  what I mean by this is that being completely bald looks so much fucking better than a balding comb over  just shave that shit when it gets to that stage   Keep it short  Get your hair cut often it will look much better short  I know the above might seem patronising but trust me I know how you feel  I have a lazy eye and girls have even straight up said "I'd date you if you didn't have a lazy eye" which is shitty as with your situation  it's not in my control but life goes on   I had made food for her because usually she says she doesn't want to eat but then sees me eating and wants some  I made food for her and then said "that's stupid" annoyed when she said she wasn't going to eat it   So I have to prepare for the mental breakdown in 8 years then    Poor Rocket league and poor me   How would someone know their ugly  I don't think I'm ugly but I'm a minority and I'm overweight so I know that limits my options pretty significantly  although I've seen non white guys heftier than me succeed so I know it's all relative  I've been working on the weight thing but it's a freaking hamster wheel  once I'm feeling isolated and depressed my progress reverses  Honestly though I don't think weight is that big a deal unless you're morbidly obese and bedridden  and even then I've read about 500 600 pound men and women finding love  I honestly have no problem dating an overweight woman   Most of my woman friends don't talk about dating  Some of them I know haven't been on dates  Either way I've begged them to set me up  give me advice  and just help me out in general  They've not done that aside from saying that "I'm an amazing person and someone somewhere will like me " While I appreciate the compliment I can't live my life in hypotheticals    r 4rFA is a sausagefest which isn't a big deal if people would take the r4r seriously  There are a lot of dudes in my area who I'd love to grab a beer with but don't want to reply to their m4f topic  As far as meeting women  I've rarely seen posts from FA women there and when there are they're not in my area  Posts from women in my area are sometimes even more selective than what I've seen on the regular r4r sub   Yeah  that's completely true  When I was younger I use to blame myself more  now I realize that it just means I haven't found my kind of people yet  It's no one's fault  Still that doesn't make me feel better whenever I feel lonely or depressed    Hey this is a good conversation idk if it's getting personal but if you want we can continue via PM instead of posting in this sub lol   You can't be THAT ugly if you've got friends  This helped a lot  sorry about the post being badly worded I wrote it very angry and upset  I'm gonna go back and ask for the room to speak to her now  Keep it that way I would say don't say it or show any sign of it  From you saying 'Now for whatever reason  I do not know  but it was possibly the fear of losing you as a friend '  It would seem that that's what you meant   Sorry  clearly it wasn't  but that's what it would seem like   What is it you believe I should take the blame for   Personally  I don't believe I deserve the blame for anything   My apology would be about how things left off  and of quite frankly nothing else as I don't believe I have to apologise for anything else   I am in no way expecting an apology from him   And I don't want one from him either   So there's nothing wrong there  Sounds like your friend was r raisedbynarcissists and is experiencing depression  Encourage him to take the advice you'll find in the subreddit I included and seek out a new therapist better suited to his situation  It sounds like you are waiting for an "event" to know when the time has come  If you believe her quality of life has diminished to the point where she effectively has to be sedated to be comfortable  I think it may be time to go through with the difficult decision   It will never feel 100  when there is so much love and attachment involved  however  it's better that your partner has an opportunity to remember her in better health than to wait until the lingering question becomes "Did I wait too long "  There is a really beautiful website called www mydogjustdied org which may be a nice way for your SO to get some closure and pay tribute to it    Our vet once told me there are three objective factors to look at when you are trying to decide if it's time  Can the dog eat Does it enjoy food still  Can the dog toilet normally  Is the dog mobile without pain  Hope this helps and we're all thinking of you  A Christmas Carol is my second favourite book  after The Hunchback of Notre Dame  because I can relate to how bitter and twisted he was after years of loneliness  Too bad I will never have the opportunity to change like he did  Thanks for this insightful answeryou've given me a lot to think about     My initials are JAW  In hindsight  although I have gotten some crap for it in the past  it really isn't that bad     Haha  if only it was "Beiged" or "Off whited " I haven't considered that before     I'm male  and I would be completely fine with my future wife keeping her maiden name  You brought up a good point with the children  thoughthat'll be something I'll have to think about here on out     I would be quite okay with the hassle  This thread made me realize  however  that I should really read up a bit more in regards to U S  naming law   In terms of timing  it looks like I'll be conducting the name change as an 18th birthday gift to myselfthat is  next Octobermy parents would prefer not to have to deal with the whole legal business   As an aside  I might do away with the hyphen  in fact  J      Nguyen Whited  Has a bit of a different feel to it  Its very creepy Thanks  it sucks how people make assumptions before they get to know you   Thanks for the advice  Here in the US  it seems to be a simple matter of taking the issue to a Superior Court  where they judge the reasoning behind the name change  Get help now  You've identified a problem  now go talk to a professional  You don't need their permission to go to a counsellor or therapist  It seems like it is really important for you to have them understand and act  rather than to get help yourself  why do you think that is  My parents gave up on me in my teenage years  They knew I would never find friends or a girlfriend and would never give them a grandchild  Preach it  I love dating me because I always get to decide where I'm eating  what I'm doing on the weekends  and what presents to buy myself  I mean unless Gillian Anderson comes knocking on my door or Cate Blanchett  I'm good  Every once in a while I get that "aww    I wish someone would hold me" feeling but then I watch Mean Girls or Office Space and then I'm over it  IBS is a bitch  I don't suffer from it  but I do have some family members who do  I really feel for you   It sounds to me like you need an ear for the stress though  not a pill  If you ever need to vent  just PM me  I've played counsellor to a lot of people in the last few years  If not  I highly advise you seek out your campus counsellor  College university can be a hell of a battleground  believe me  I know too     and many people only get by with help from the counselling services on offer  You should never have to feel like you're alone  I'm not against abortion  it's just something I'm not willing to do to myself  I could never live it down and I'd never forgive myself  Thanks  I'm glad      If you're unhappy  change it   If it was that easy  there wouldn't be any unhappy people on earth  We are both 20  If you haven't seen this video already  it won't help the "not sure how to change paths" bit  but Steves comments on the importance of finding something  you enjoy and not settling are really great  https   www youtube com watch v UF8uR6Z6KLc  IMO  no matter how high the probable cost to your happiness of jumping to a new job or even industry is  it sounds like it's probably less than the cost of inaction   My advice would be to read  watch and listen to things that inspire you  as corny as that sounds   Elon Musks biography on audiobook was the thing that pushed me over the edge to try a new side gig  and that has been one of the most rewarding experiences in my life  Best of luck   thank you  I mean  you actually are    It's worth looking for something that you can at least do part time  Maybe freelance work  so you can do it whenever you can  but don't have to when you're having a particularly bad day   I don't think "profitability" is a particularly good way to measure things  I understand it may be hard to find a job  but not everyone is just a cog in the Capitalist machine that will shut you down without considering you  I'm sorry  I totally feel your pain  I am sorry  that must be difficult to hear about  Are you still in touch with your first crush  Yay  congrats    My fiancee have and I have talked about "running off" and doing the same thing  I have no advice  nor will I pass judgment on people who are  simply  human    I send good wishes for a resolution   You've been heard   Good posture and eye contact  aka "fake it til you make it  does not equal getting dates  Either way we both know your boyfriend needs to know  You really can't just not even tell him   That being said tell him it's his choice how much he wants to be involved but from what you put below it sounds like you're keeping it and you should tell him this   As a guy who's seen similar things happen before  he may get mad at you at first  Be prepared but give him time to accept it   This is pretty much the point where you see truly what kind of man he is   I agree with the other comment  Its never too late im 25 starting over again  Its better late than never  You don't need her parent's permission to get help  Sometimes you have to subvert the parents to get help   The reasons why they don't want to support her through this is their own baggage that has literally NOTHING to do with her  so don't try and make her win their approval to validate her health  That will take too long and they clearly have some shit to sort out with their own mental health if their daughter is being medicated but they can't come to terms with the fact that she is suffering in a very real way  They are going to have to take care of themselves  Focus on your gf and get her help NOW    If she is school age then she can talk to a counsellor at school or uni  These people are trained to help people like your gf  so let them help  Even better  they maybe able to involve her parents  and when they hear this coming from a professional  they might be able to adjust their mindset  Coming from you and your gf  it might be easier to dismiss    This might be helpful  https   kylarosesims wordpress com 2016 11 23 when your partner has anxiety 8 tips for getting help  I was referring to why he didn't speak with you on the matter of his depression  Some people are like that  Especially with depression  If you don't want advice  why come here  It seems to me that compromise isn't in your nature  and relationships for all that they are require some level of compromise  I was trying to help you  Not put you down  If you don't want any more advice  stop responding  Actually normie is a pretty chill word  It's the ones who use the word  "cuck" unironically that makes me cringe  Is this the same guy from  this post  https   www reddit com r dating advice comments 5j2qib how do you move on     Based off what you wrote in that other post he really seems like he doesn't see himself with you and wants to move on  With both of you being 20  I would say that's a pretty good direction to move in  You've been together 4 years since you were 16  and those are tumultuous years where you both are doing a lot of growing   Believe it or not  at 20 you still have a lot more growing to do  Not physically  but mentally  Having been only in one relationship  you don't have a good sense for different types of people in different relationships  People can vary widely  and after being with this guy for 4 years  you probably learned a lot about what you like and what you don't like when looking for a partner  As you date more guys  you will learn more about yourself  not to mention that just getting more real world life experience in general will give you more perspective as well   All this being said  you seem to genuinely want to stay with him  but he wants to break up with you  I don't see his reasons for wanting to break up  but ultimately it doesn't change the outcome  If he wants to break up  then he wants to break up  It could be that while you two were good together as boyfriend girlfriend and didn't have any major issues  but you're just not the person he wants to spend the rest of his life with  I dated a girl for over a year and we had no major issues  There were little annoyances here and there  but nothing that ever hinted at cracking the foundation of our relationship  But after a year I was thinking about our long term future together and when I looked at her I knew that she wasn't the person I wanted to spend the rest of my life with  She was a great person and we had no major issues  but it just wasn't the person I wanted to commit to  That could be him as well  and if that's the case  that's okay  I think you've got the right mindset to let him go if that's his choice  I'm sure it hurts like hell though   So that's my big pep talk to say "You can find another guy " Now  about the baby  Let me say this first  and forgive me since you already ruled it out  Abortion is an option out there  If you choose not to because it's against your beliefs  I completely understand  However  if it's because you feel there's too much external pressure from your parents  boyfriend  or other people  then at least think about it as an option   In any case  whether you decide to abort it  put it up for adoption  or raise it  it's his baby too and he needs to be involved in the decision making process  This is one of the biggest moments of your life  You've taken some adult actions and now there are some adult consequences that you both need to be ready to face  He's free to have whatever feelings he wants  He can be shocked  angry  sad  etc  Whatever feelings he has  allow him to react  but eventually you two have to decide what you want to do together  It would be helpful to let him know that abortion is not an option  From that point  you can talk about adoption versus raising it  and if you're going to raise it  then how big of a role he wants in the child's life   No matter what I say  your parents say  your friends say  or anyone else says  the crux of all of this boils down to the decisions you and your boyfriend make together  Take your time to make those decisions  and don't be too hasty  You don't have to sit down together and figure it all out in one night  In fact  maybe the first time you sit down together  just have the goal to be accepting where you two are  and focus on making your plans for the future in a later meeting   It's scary  There's no good way to say it  There's nothing to worry about in terms of phrasing or delivering the message  This is a big scary unknown question mark for each of you  Talk about your feelings and just get it all out  There's nothing you need to sort out or get ready for ahead of time  This is a conversation you two can have together and figure out as you go  The only thing you should be sure of is that you are truly pregnant  Take a couple pregnancy tests to be sure  Ideally you might have had an OB appointment already to confirm it  but that's not necessary   Logistically  I'd plan to meet with him after he eats  Some time around 2 00PM or so would be good  He'll have eaten lunch and it's still a ways off from dinner  You guys can talk for awhile  then after a few hours maybe you guys have settled down enough that you can get something to eat and talk some more   He also might need space  If you tell him  he may need to take some time to come to grips with the situation before sitting down with you and being ready to talk  Like I said  he might be angry at you  which of course is misplaced anger   but he'll need to work through it  He might be in denial or shock at first  If he needs some space right away  that's okay  Just meet up later then   Sorry  I don't have any concrete answers for you here  Your next step is the biggest one  and that's to talk with him  If you can meet up with him without breaking the news  I think this is the type of news that should be delivered in person versus via the phone or a text message  But seeing as how you two are on a break  maybe you have to tell him in order to get him to come  I think it says a lot that she didn't just leave after all of that happened  or didn't just sleep  She stayed up and took care of you  That definitely means something in my book  and I agree with the other users  Give it a little time  Not too much though  Maybe even make it a point to apologize to her friends as well  It's always nice to have the SO's friends on your side That  right there  is everybody's go to reaction when forming an excuse for their own lack of inner strength  I've heard it one hundred times  and I've tackled it one hundred times   Zen buddhism is your friend  Its not a point of being 'happy ' its a point of being content  and having the will to master your own fate  Its a long  uphill battle to reach a point of serenity  but when you get there  you'll feel like the wind  Its almost a complete void  but not a negative one  Its a plateau in time and space where only you exist  and everything is malleable to your will  It is not bad at all to lack inner strength  but it is bad to lack acknowledgement of your true state of soul and spirit   Happiness is a human construct  You can define it  or you can remove it altogether  I highly recommend Miyamoto Musashi's Book of Five Rings  Read it  take it seriously  take it all in   "There is nothing outside of yourself that can ever enable you to get better  stronger  richer  quicker  or smarter  Everything is within  Everything exists  Seek nothing outside of yourself " Life is a joke  my friend  I suggest writing down how you feel or maybe just taking a moment to breathe  Nothing is as bad as it seems  You have plenty of time to have a good year   If you really need someone to listen to you  there's a website called 7cups where you can talk to someone for as long as you need to  Thanks for that  I think I'll play some football and maybe go to some smash tournaments  I just am so tired of this life I'm stuck living at the moment  I wish I could just skip time forward 6 months   It's not a normal thing to occur  Man a people sleep on their backs  I really identify with what you're saying  I think loneliness is a natural feeling  but as an introvert who now has a small family I've come to realize that loneliness is far better than being expected to be social  As a mom  I'm expected to make mom friends  but I don't happen to fit into the mold with the moms at the playgroups  I'm Metis  I don't dress in brands  and I don't care for make up so I'm automatically a pariah amongst the other moms as most people simply don't like natives  even if they are whitewashed like me  As a result  I've simply stopped caring if people like me  but that's not good for my children because they need playmates  My wish is to socialize my children  because I know that I am introverted as a result of not being properly socialized as a child  we moved too often for me to learn how to make and build friendships  It wasn't until I was in middle and high school that I made friends with anyone because we finally stayed in one city  Even then I was what I would consider to be a bad friend  though not always  but in some ways I was  Are flowers a good idea  They're very cliche and I'm not sure how she'd feel about it  So I just wanted to let you know that my appointment was today  She was a great woman and read my list of symptoms that I compiled with my fianc and sister  She kept a poker face and said it sounds like I have depression and anxiety and suggested medication  there are nurse practitioners in the office who can help me out so that's nice     I'm not sure if I call back for the NP now or wait until the next appointment  1 20   I don't want them to think I'm trying to get drugs or something   I had sleep paralasys 3 times and i always slept on my side so I think its not about sleeping on your back  I mean  I was on a couple different antipsychotics  but other doctors questioned the need for that when I would be in the hosp etc  a couple different mood stabilizers  an antidepressant  a benzo  calcium channel blocker that was being used for psych benefits  plus other meds for other things  In fairness  I was on those because most psych meds that I have been on have caused serious reactions requiring ER visits and sometimes stays in the medical hospital    Ultimately  the nightmare scenario is that I am not really responsive to meds that improve mood  I get the sedative effects of some and so I can still use anxiety medication  but as for any mood benefit  I get nothing  It has been well documented in my chart now for over a decade of trial and error with multiple things   The ONLY receptors in my brain that seem to respond in terms of mood are the NMDA receptors and we found that out by accident when I was given ketamine in the ER to break a nasty intractable headache  Turns out  ketamine will improve my mood for 2 3 weeks  I didn't like the "high" but I did like the mood benefit  Sadly  it isn't FDA approved for mood yet  although Johnson and Johnson through their subsidiary Janssen is allegedly nearing the end of phase 3 trials and is expected to release a ketamine metabolite called eskatiamine in intranasal form sometime this year   In the meantime  there are really no drugs for me    That is more info than you wanted I am sure  but yes  there is a way to take more meds  You need a good doctor who knows his her way around the pharmacology  If you can't figure it out then just set another reminder for 7 years from now to delete the second reminder  Im sure someone will have figured it out by then    Although  while Japan is witnessing men lost to solitude and withdrawal  aren't the women are just going for white guys   I don't think that's the case   From what I read an unusually large amount of men  and  women are simply not having romantic relationships  For women they apparently find it troublesome to commit to one  since they often end up having to choose between pursuing their careers or becoming a wife   But that's just from memory of things i've read on the matter  so take that info with a grain of salt  http   www succeedsocially com practiceconversation I can text "status" to my provider and will get a message with my remaining data and call allowance in return  If I told you the whole story from the start  you would either not believe it  or you would stop me in the middle somewhere and tell me that was my problem   I almost broke free from FA last year  but the woman who found me interesting  and was the first non family member to tell me they loved me in a romantic way  decided to go back to her husband and kids after flying over 12 hours to see me and only spending one night cuddling  which meant a whole lot more to me than sex   She was a co worker of mine  we worked online and connected there   and I found myself let go from the company later after others found out  I was used to make her husband jealous and more appreciative of her  In that respect  I suppose I have something to build something from since cuddling for one night was indeed a success  but it's a very tenuous one  as the end result was me feeling even more alone and becoming more abandoned than before  If a similar situation presented itself again  I would probably avoid it because of the fear of it turning out in a similar or even worse way   At my age and at my level of social development  I have trouble believing that it will be worth whatever time and effort it takes to bring myself to a point where others desire to be with me  I would rather learn how to make the most of being alone and find ways to keep myself from wasting time thinking about love and relationships  They are obviously meant for others  even when people say I am lovable  they demonstrate the opposite  I do not trust anyone and I trust myself even less
